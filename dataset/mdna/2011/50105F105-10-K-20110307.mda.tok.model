item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
during  approximately one half of our sales volumes were sold into european markets 
we believe we are the largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes in in addition  we estimate we have a share of north american tio sales volumes in our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product or gdp and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect demand for tio will grow by to per year  consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gdp 
however  even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp  in part due to relative changes in t he tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe our customers inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market tio selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product 
the majority of our tio grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products  we compete for sales primarily on the basis of price 
the factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are our tio sales and production volumes  tio selling prices  currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro  norwegian krone and the canadian dollar and manufacturing costs  particularly raw materials  maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
tio selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
in addition  our effective income tax rate in each of  and has been impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below 
executive summary we reported net income of million  or per diluted share for  compared to a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share for our diluted earnings per share increased from to primarily due to i the net effects of higher income from operations in resulting principally from higher sales and production volumes and higher selling prices throughout and ii a non cash deferred income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of we reported a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share for  compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share for our diluted earnings per share decreased from to primarily due to the net effects of i lower income loss from operations in resulting principally from lower sales and production volumes and ii an income tax benefit we recognized in in late  as a result of the sharp decline in global demand  we experienced a build up in our inventory levels 
in order to decrease our inventory levels and improve our liquidity  we implemented production curtailments during the first half of in addition  throughout all of we implemented cost controls and reduced our capita l spending 
through these actions we successfully reduced our inventory and increased our liquidity  although the resulting curtailments led to a net loss in due to the large amount of unabsorbed fixed production costs we charged to expense as incurred 
net income for includes a million first quarter non cash income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
net income for includes a million non cash income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
net income for includes a million non cash income tax benefit 
per diluted share related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related the reto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets 
we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements of accounting standard codification asc topic property  plant and equipment and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in asc topic are present 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
benefit plans 
we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and opeb costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported ne t income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
at december   we have concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three year period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  if we were to generate losses in our german operations for an extended period of time  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards woul d no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
it is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made 
in addition  we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non us subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability tha t would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us contingencies 
we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income loss from operations is impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investments and long lived assets  defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals 
in addition  net income loss is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
comparison of to results of operations year ended december  dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin other operating income and expenses  net income loss from operations change tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes percent change in net sales tio product pricing tio sales volumes tio product mix changes in currency exchange rates total thousands of metric tons current industry conditions and overview throughout  global customer demand for our tio products continued to strengthen  and our production facilities operated at near full capacity rates 
we believe that inventories throughout the tio industry remain at historically low levels despite efforts of the major tio producers to operate their facilities at near full capacity 
as a result of improved tio industry conditions  we implemented significant incr eases in tio selling prices during that resulted in increased profitability and cash flows 
even with such increased profitability  we currently believe that profit margins are significantly lower than necessary to reasonably justify greenfield or other major expansions of tio capacity 
provided global demand for tio products remains strong  we expect the low level of worldwide tio inventories to continue for several years  and anticipate further implementation of tio selling price increases 
based on these positive market dynamics in the tio industry  we expect our profitability and cash flows to significantly increase in and the foreseeable future 
net sales as a result of the above conditions in the tio industry  our net sales increased or million for compared to  primarily due to a increase in sales volumes and an increase in average selling prices 
in addition  we estimate the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to the same period in tio selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures and changes in the relative level of supply and demand 
based on the current conditions in the tio industry  we currently expect average selling prices in to be significantly higher than the average selling prices in record sales volumes in increased as compared to due to higher demand across all market segments resulting from the improvement in current economic conditions 
we expect demand in will exceed levels 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million or for compared to due to the net impact of a increase in tio production volumes to a new production record of  metric tons  a increase in sales volumes  an increase in maintenance costs of million  and higher raw material costs of million 
in addition  cost of sales for was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of higher production costs in at our ilmenite mines in norway 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in primarily due to higher selling prices in and the significantly higher production volumes in  as we implemented temporary plant curtailments during the first half of in order to reduce our finished goods inventories to an appropriate level 
such temporary plant curtailments resulted in approximately million of unabsorbed fixed production costs which were charged directly to cost of sales in the first six months of income loss from operations income loss from operations increased by million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in income loss from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase is driven by the improvement in gross margin  which increased to for compared to for our gross margin has increased primarily because of higher sales volumes  higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs per ton resulting from higher production volumes 
however  changes in currency exchange rates have negatively affected our gross margin and income loss from operations 
we estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased income loss from operations by approximately million in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately and for and respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million in to million in due to decreased average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision was million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax provision in includes a million non cash income tax benefit related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of the resolution of tax audits in belgium and germany in the third and fourth quarters 
comparison of to results of operations year ended december  dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin other operating income and expenses  net income loss from operations change tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes percent change in net sales tio product pricing tio sales volumes tio product mix changes in currency exchange rates total thousands of metric tons net sales net sales decreased or million for compared to  primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes and a decrease in average selling prices 
variations in grades of products sold unfavorably impacted net sales by 
in addition  we estimate the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to the same period in tio selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
as a result of these market pressures our average tio prices in were lower than the prior year 
during the first half of  our average selling prices were generally declining  as we faced weak demand and excessive inventory levels 
beginning in mid  we and our competitors announced various price increases 
a portion of these price increase announcements were implemented during the third and fourth quarters of  and as a result our average selling price at the end of the second half of was higher than at the end of the first half of our decrease in sales volumes in was primarily due to lower sales volumes in europe and north america as a result of a global weakening of demand due to poor overall economic conditions  principally in the first half of cost of sales cost of sales decreased or million for  compared to  primarily due to the net impact of a decrease in sales volumes  lower raw material costs of million  a decrease in maintenance costs of million as part of our efforts to reduce operating costs where possible and currency fluctuations primarily the euro 
the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in the year ended december  compared to in the same period of primarily due to the unfavorable effects of the significant amount of unabsorbed fixed production costs resulting from reduced production volumes during the first six months of tio pro duction volumes decreased due to temporary plant curtailments during the first six months of that resulted in approximately million of unabsorbed fixed production costs which were charged directly to cost of sales in the first six months of income loss from operations income loss from operations declined by million from income from operations of million in to a loss from operations of million in income loss from operations as a percentage of net sales declined to in from in this decrease is driven by the decline in gross margin  which fell to for compared to for our gross margin has decreased primarily because of the significant amount of unabsorbed fixed production costs resulting from the production curtailments we implemented during the first six months of as well as the effect of lower sales volumes 
however  changes in currency rates positively affected our gross margin and income loss from operations 
we estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income loss from operations by approximately million in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately for both and other non operating income and expense  net interest expense decreased 
million from million in to million in due to changes in currency exchange rates which offset the effect of increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and higher interest rates on our european credit facility 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax benefit our income tax benefit was million in compared to million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax benefit to our actual tax benefit 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million related to a net decrease in our reserve for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of the resolution of tax audits in belgium and germany in the third and fourth quarters 
our income tax benefit for includes a non cash benefit of million relating to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
effects of currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our sales from non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate flu ctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  we estimate that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income loss from operations for the periods indicated 
impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change in millions impact on net sales income loss from operations impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change in millions impact on net sales income loss from operations the negative impact on income loss from operations for the versus comparison is due to increased currency transaction losses in as compared to which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
the positive impact on income loss from operations for the versus comparison is due to increased currency transaction gains in as compared to which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
outlook we operated our production facilities at near full capacity levels during  and our production volumes in set a new record for us 
given the current tio industry dynamics  we currently expect to continue to operate our facilities at near full capacity levels throughout while we will continue to work on debottlenecking projects in to increase our production capacity  we believe such debottlenecking projects are now only able to produce nominal increases in our capacity  and as a result our production volumes in are only expected to increase by a few thousand metric tons as compared to the overall strong global demand for tio we experienced in is expected to continue in  and inventory levels throughout the tio industry remain at historically low levels 
as a result  in we expect we will be able to sell all of the tio we produce 
given our expectations for the level of our increased production capacity in discussed above  we similarly expect our sales volumes in will only increase by a few thousand metric tons as compared to during and  we announced various tio price increases  a portion of which were implemented during the second half of and throughout the year of our average tio selling prices were higher for the full year as compared to the full year  and our average selling prices at the end of were higher as compared to the end of as discussed above  even with the increased profitability we achieved in  we currently believe that profit margins are significantly lower than necessary to reasonably justify greenfield or other major expansions of tio capacit y 
as a result  we anticipate our average selling prices will continue to increase significantly during we also expect relative increases in our raw material  energy and freight costs during  including more than normal inflationary increases in the cost of our feedstock ore and petroleum coke 
overall  we currently expect our per metric ton cost of tio we produce will increase approximately to in as compared to given the current conditions in the tio industry  if our costs of production exceed our current expectations in  we believe we could recoup such higher costs through additional selling price increases 
overall  we expect income from operations will be significantly higher in as compared to  as the favorable effect of higher selling prices will more than offset the impact of higher production costs 
our expectations as to the future of the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  continued operation of competitors  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following items higher income loss from operations in of million  higher cash paid for income taxes in of million resulting from our increased profitability  lower cash paid for interest in of due to lower average borrowings in  higher net cash used by related changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in compared to  and lower net distribution from our tio venture in of million due to related changes in their cash requirements 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in this million increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following items lower income loss from operations in of million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in as compared to  primarily due to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  and lower net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash requirements 
changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
as shown below our average days sales outstanding decreased at december  compared to december  due to the timing of collections on receivable balances  and our average days sales in inventory decreased at december  compared to december   as our tio sales volumes in exceeded our production volumes 
for comparative purposes  we have provided prior year numbers below 
december  december  december  days sales outstanding days days days days sales in inventory days days days investing activities our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures are primarily for maintenance to existing facilities 
our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
in november  we entered into an unsecured revolving demand promissory note with valhi whereby  as amended  we agreed to loan valhi up to million 
for the year ended december   we loaned a net million to valhi under this agreement 
it is likely we will loan additional amounts to valhi during see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased an aggregate of million in marketable equity securities of related parties  including million in trades which settled in early see note to our consolidated financial statements 
financing activities during  we repaid million under our us credit facility  and repaid net euro million million when borrowed repaid under our european credit facility 
in november   we completed a secondary public offering of million shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering generating net proceeds of million 
see item market for common equity and related stockholder matters and note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we borrowed a net of million under our us credit facility  borrowed and repaid million under our european credit facility  and made net payments of million on our credit facility with our affiliate nl 
during  we made net payments of million on our us credit facility  borrowed a net of million on our european credit facility  and borrowed a net of million on our credit facility with our affiliate nl 
during  we paid a quarterly dividend to our stockholders of 
per share for an aggregate dividend million 
in february  our board of directors suspended the quarterly dividend after considering the challenges and opportunities that exist in the tio industry at the time 
we reinstated our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of and we paid a dividend of 
per share for an aggregate dividend of million 
in february  our board of directors declared a first quarter regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record as of march  in addition  our board of directors also declared a special dividend of per share to shareholders of record on february  which we paid on february see item market for common equity and related stockholder matters 
outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt was comprised of euro million principal amount of our senior secured notes million due in  and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with applicable covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined in the agreement of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the outstanding indebtedness indicated above  at december  we have our euro million european credit facility  for which no amounts were outstanding and the equivalent of million was available for borrowing by our european subsidiaries 
in addition  at december   one of our us subsidiaries had a million revolving credit facility  and our canadian subsidiary had a cdn 
million revolving credit facility  in each case with no outstanding borrowings at such date 
we voluntarily terminated these us and canadian facilities in february and january  respectively 
on february   we called for the redemption of euro million principal amount of the notes on march  we intend to borrow under our european revolving credit facility discussed above in order to fund such redemption 
our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries  and our ability to service parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kii has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interests of certain of kii s first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral for the senior secured notes 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes limits kii s ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments 
at december   the maximum amount of dividends and other restricted payment s that kii could make the restricted payment basket was approximately million 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the or dinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we m ay investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had credit available under our european credit facility of approximately million 
at december   we could borrow such amount without violating any covenants in such facility 
based upon our expectation for the tio industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term obligations defined as the twelve month period ending december  and our long term obligations defined as the five year period ending december   our time period for long term budgeting 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
capital expenditures we intend to spend approximately million to maintain and improve our existing facilities during  including approximately million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
the majority of our expenditures in will be to maintain our facilities 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand or borrowing under existing credit facilities

it is our policy to engage in transactions with related parties on terms  in our opinion  no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unrelated parties 
commitments and contingencies see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for a description of certain income tax examinations currently underway  certain legal proceedings and other commitments 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no recent accounting pronouncements expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period ended december  debt and other contractual commitments as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes   and to our consolidated financial statements 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments in the table below are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments of ours and our consolidated subsidiaries as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payment due date contractual commitment and after total in millions indebtedness interest payments onindebtedness operating leases long term supply contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock long term service and other supply contracts fixed asset acquisitions estimated tax obligations a significant portion of the amount shown for indebtedness relates to our senior secured notes million at december  
such indebtedness is denominated in euro 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts shown for interest for any outstanding variable rate indebtedness is based upon the december  interest rates and assumes that such variable rate indebtedness remains outstanding until maturity 
our contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that we are required to purchase  although certain of these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased  generally no more than  based on our feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally based on a fixed price with price escalation clauses primarily based on consumer price indices  as defined in the respective contracts 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to the long term supply contracts for tio feedstock are based upon our current estimate of the quantity of material that will be purchased in each time period shown  the pay ment that would be due based upon such estimated purchased quantity and an estimate of the effect of the price escalation clause 
the actual amount of material purchased and the actual amount that would be payable by us  may vary from such estimated amounts 
our obligation for the purchase of tio feedstock is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements and above in business raw materials 
the amounts shown for the long term service and other supply contracts primarily pertain to agreements we have entered into with various providers of products or services which help to run our plant facilities electricity  natural gas  etc  utilizing december  exchange rates

the amount shown for estimated tax obligations is the consolidated amount of net income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during the above table does not reflect any amounts we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans during such defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans are discussed below in greater detail 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
any amounts we might pay related to our asset retirement obligations as the terms and amounts of such future fundings are unknown  any amounts we might pay to settle any of our uncertain tax positions  as the timing and amount of any such future settlements are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the timing of tax audits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  and any amounts we might pay to acquire tio from our tio manufacturing joint venture  as the timing and amount of such purchases are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the amount of tio produced by the joint venture in the future and the joint venture s future cost of producing such tio however  the table does include amounts related to our share of the joint venture s ore requirements necessary to produce tio for us 
see item  busin ess and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchase  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
under defined benefit pension plan accounting  defined benefit pension plan expense and pension assets and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
we recognize the full funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as either an asset for overfunded plans or a liability for underfunded plans in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pension adjustment in connection with the correction of our pension expense previously recognized for and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us and will generally differ from pension expense for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates  and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each december valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest c omponent of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in europe and north america and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany canada norway us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan  the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year and an estimate of the amount of contributions to and distributions from the plan during the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate long term rates of return 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
we expect the long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities  and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately   and  respectively 
in the us substantially all of the assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold c 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt and is a member of the cmrt investment committee 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices  while utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
the cmrt holds timet common stock in its investment portfolio  however through december  we invested in a portion of the cmrt which does not include the timet holdings 
beginning in  we now invest in the portion of the cmrt that holds such stock 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return excluding the cmrt s investment in timet common stock has been  while such annual rate of return including timet common stock has been 
our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate cash  cash equivalents and other total we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each non us plan and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the cmrt trustee and investment committee do not maintain a specific target asset allocation in order to achieve their objectives  but instead they periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectations regarding potential returns for various investment alternatives and what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany canada norway us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables  which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves o r plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial loss of approximately million 
this actuarial loss resulted primarily from the net effects of i the overall return on plan assets being in excess of the assumed return and ii the general reduction in discount rates from december  to december  based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of our plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans certain subsidiaries of ours in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under other postretirement employee benefits opeb accounting  opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
we recognize the full unfunded status of our opeb plans as a liability 
we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately 
million in  
million in and million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated 
million in each of and and 
million in substantially all of our us accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current us employees 
some of our canadian employees are earning opeb benefits 
due to continued increases in healthcare costs  it is expected that our opeb expense for financial reporting purposes will be consistent with the past two years 
our expected opeb benefit payments for are expected to be similar amounts 
the discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related opeb obligations are based on current interest rates earned on high quality bond yields in the applicable country where the benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates  and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the opeb obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of opeb expense for the following year 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately 
million of contributions to such plans during in the fourth quarter of  we amended our benefit formula for most participants of our plans effective january   resulting in a prior service credit of approximately million as of december  key assumptions including the health care cost trend rate as of december  now reflect these plan revisions to the benefit formula 
as a result  our expected expense reflects the amortization of this credit 
we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  a basis point change in assumed discount rates would have the following effects basis point increase basis point decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts we report for health care plans 
a one percent change in assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects increase decrease in millions effect on net opeb cost during effect at december  on postretirement obligation operations outside the united states as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone and united kingdom pound sterling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  the majority of our aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for such non us dollar denominated indebtedness is presented in its non us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us dollars per euro 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in millions as of december  fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated senior secured notes as of december  fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated senior secured notes variable rate indebtedness us credit facility dollar denominated europe credit facility euro denominated currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness at december  the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
at december   we had currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates ranging from cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts with wachovia bank  national association  mature from january through december at a rate of million per month  subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
an aggregate million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per us dollar 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through july at a rate of million to million per month 
an aggregate euro million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per euro 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through august at a rate of euro million to euro million per month  subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
the estimated fair value of such currency forward contracts at december  was a million net asset  which amount is recognized as part of accounts and other receivables in our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding million currency transaction gain in our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent we held such contracts during  and  we did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
marketable equity security prices we are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable equity securities which we own 
the fair value of equity securities at december  was million 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be approximately million at december  we held no marketable equity securities at december  raw materials we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices relating to our raw materials 
as discussed in item we generally enter into long term supply agreements for certain of our raw material requirements including ore 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  although these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased 
raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated annually 
for certain raw material requirements we do not have long term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low  or because long term supply agreements for those raw mater ials are generally not available 
other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
