risk factors risks to our industry our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer  but also small businesses and other retailers 
the united states and global economies have suffered from a prolonged recession for the past several years and a result consumer spending has remained depressed  and may be subject to further deterioration for the foreseeable future 
specialty retail  and retail in general  is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
purchases of non essential products tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects  as disposable income declines 
during periods of economic uncertainty  we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers  m ake sales to new customers  open and operate new stores  maintain sales levels at our existing stores  maintain or increase our international operations on a profitable basis  or maintain our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales 
as a result  our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by continued downward trends or uncertainly in the united states or global economies 
increases in the price of leather and other items we sell or a reduction in availability of those products could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability 
the prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for leather  metals  and other products 
the cost of these items may fluctuate substantially  depending on a variety of factors  including demand  supply conditions  transportation costs  government regulation  economic climates  political considerations  and other unpredictable factors 
leather prices world wide have increase significantly in the past year and the outlook for future prices is uncertain 
increases in these costs  together with other factors  will make it difficult for us to sustain the gross margin level we have achieved in recent years and result in a decrease in our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers or reduce costs in other areas 
further  continued involvement by the united states in war and other military operations in the middle east and other areas abroad could disrupt international trade and affect our inventory sources 
finally  livestock diseases such as mad cow could reduce the availability of hides and leathers or increase their cost 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain our brand image 
tandy leather is one of the most recognized brand names in our industry 
our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of that brand 
if we are unable to provide quality products and exceptional customer service to our customers  including education  which tandy has traditionally been known for  our brand name may be impaired 
many specialty retailers have experienced periods of growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses 
our business may be similarly affected in the future 
risks related to our business we may be unable to sustain our past growth or manage our future growth  which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we have experienced solid sales and earnings growth recently 
we anticipate that our future growth rate will depend on a number of factors  including the strength and protection of our brand name  the market success of our current and future products  the success of our growth strategies  and our ability to manage our future growth 
our future success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage our growth effectively  optimizing our operational  administrative  financial and legal procedures in order to maximize profitability 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 
our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors  including fluctuations in the cost of the leathers and metal products that we purchase and changes in consumer spending patterns and acceptance of our products 
these factors may prohibit us from passing cost increases on to customers which could cause our gross margin to decline 
if our product costs increase and our sale prices do not  our future operating results could be adversely affected unless we are able to offset such gross margin declines with comparable reductions in operating costs 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our planned international expansion  which could impair the value of our brand  harm our business and negatively affect our results of operation 
we plan to grow our net sales and net earnings from our international segment by opening store in various international markets 
as we expand outside of north america  we may incur significant costs relating to starting up  maintaining and expanding foreign operations 
costs may include  but are not limited to obtaining locations for stores  hiring personnel  and travel expenses 
we may be unable to open and operate new stores successfully and our growth may be limited  unless we are able to identify desirable sites for store locations  negotiate acceptable lease terms  hired  train and retain competent store personnel  manage inventory effectively to meet the needs and demands of customers on a timely basis  manage foreign currency risk effectively  and achieve acceptable operating margins from the new st ores 
we cannot be sure that we can successfully open new stores or that our new stores will be profitable 
as we continue to increase our international operations  we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors which are beyond our control  such as political instability or acts of terrorism  which disrupt trade with the countries in which our suppliers or customers are located  local business practices that do not conform to legal or ethical guidelines  restrictions or regulations relating to imports or exports  additional or increased customs duties  tariffs  taxes and other charges on imports  significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  social  legal or economic instability in the foreign markets in which we do business  which could influence our ability to sell our products in these markets  and restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
our success depends on the continued protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position  and the loss of or inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis 
despite any precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or determine the extent of any unauthorized use 
our efforts to establish and protect our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation or counterfeiting of our products by others  which may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name 
further  we could incur substantial costs in legal actions relating to our use of intellectual property or the use of our intellectual property by others 
even if we are successful in these actions  the costs we incur could have a material adverse affect on us 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we generally purchase our products in us dollars 
however  we source a large portion of our products from countries other than the united states 
the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the applicable currencies 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international business will sell products 
furthermore  the majority of our international sales are generally derived from sales in foreign countries 
this revenue  when translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes  could be materially affected by fluctuations in the us dollar  negatively impacting our results of operations and our ability to generate revenue growth 
other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control  may occur as well 

table of contents item properties we lease all of our store locations premises  with the majority of our stores having initial lease terms of approximately five years 
the leases are generally renewable  with increases in lease rental rates in some cases 
we believe that all of our properties are adequately covered by insurance 
the properties leased by us are described in item in the description of each of our three operating segments 
we also lease a square foot showroom in the denver merchandise mart for  per year 
this lease will expire in october we own our corporate headquarters  which includes our central warehouse and manufacturing facility  sales  advertising  administrative  and executive offices

summary we are the world largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items 
our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores 
we have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices 
the key to our success is our ability to grow our base business 
we grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations 
we intend to continue to expand both domestically  in the short term  and internationally  in the long term 
we operate in three segments 
first  wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our leather factory stores and our national account group  is our oldest segment with sales of million in historically  in normal economic conditions  this division has generally offered steady but very modest increases in sales 
sales in increased compared to compared to  the wholesale stores sales increased and national account sales were down 
sales at the stores are showing signs of recovery despite an overall weakness in consumer spending as a result of the weak us economy 
sales to national accounts tend to be less consistent 
since acquiring its assets in  tandy leather has been re established as the operator of retail leathercraft stores 
prior to our acquisition in  all of the tandy leather retail stores had been closed 
these retail stores comprise our second segment  retail leathercraft 
this segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in  up from million in and is our largest source of revenues 
our business plan calls for opening an average of stores annually as we work toward a goal of stores from stores at the end of we have slowed down our new store openings in recent years due to the general economic conditions in the us and because of the lack of personnel qualified for store manager positions but hope to resume a more acti ve store opening schedule in the next several years 
our third segment is international leathercraft  which consists of stores located outside of north america 
currently  we have one retail wholesale combination store located in the united kingdom  which was opened in february it is our intention to add more stores to this segment once we have a large enough customer base to support additional stores 
on a consolidated basis  a key indicator of costs  gross margin as a percent of total net sales  increased in and in operating expenses increased at a slower pace than that of sales  increasing between and and between and we reported consolidated net income for of million 
consolidated net income for and was million and million  respectively 
we use our cash flow to fund our operations  to fund the opening of new tandy leather stores  to purchase necessary property and equipment and to make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market 
in  we incurred million in bank debt to purchase a  square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units 
we moved into that facility in the first quarter of in  we paid a one time dividend to our stockholders  totaling million 
at the end of  our stockholders equity had decreased to million from million the previous year 
comparing the december  balance sheet with the prior year s balance sheet  we increased our investment in inventory from million to million  while total cash including certificates of deposit and other short term investments decreased from million to million as a result of the special one time cash dividend 

table of contents net sales net sales for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft total company incr decr from prior year our net sales increased by in when compared with and increased by in when compared with in  all three segments reported sales increases compared to in  our retail and international leathercraft segments reported sales increases while our wholesale leathercraft segment reported sales declines 
the reduction in sales in our wholesale stores is the result of the overall economic slowdown in the us that economic slowdown has impacted our retail stores as well  although not as significantly  due to the faster economic recovery on the part of retail consumers compared to small businesses and wholesalers 
costs and expenses in general  our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve  the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally 
our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process  and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors 
sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels 
therefore  as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix  higher gross margins tend to follow 
finally  there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer 
as a result  our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period 
for  our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to 
our cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales increased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to 
increases in gross margin are primarily due to sales mix 
retail sales are at a higher gross margin than that of wholesale sales 
therefore  as retail sales increase at a faster pace than that of wholesale sales  gross margin increases accordingly 
our gross margins for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft total company our operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in this decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew more slowly than our sales during this period 
operating expenses were million higher than those of significant expense fluctuations in compared to are as follows expense amount incr decr over employee compensation benefits million million travel expense credit card fees rent utilities million professional fees and licenses freight out shipping product to customers million loss on disposal of equipment the increase in employee compensation and benefits is due primarily to the increase in store manager compensation 
our store managers are paid a percentage of the operating profit generated by the store they manage as additional compensation so as store profits increase  manager compensation increases 
also we increased the number of regional managers in from five to seven which contributed to the increase in expense 
our operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in this decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew more slowly than our sales during this period

sales in the wholesale stores increased in compared to sales in while the sales decline in our national account group was from to by customer group  we increased sales in the wholesale stores significantly to our retail and modestly to our wholesale customers  but had sales declines in all other groups 
the most significant decreases were in our national account and manufacturer groups 
small manufacturers have been significantly affected by the weakness in our economy 
our sales mix by customer group in the wholesale leathercraft division was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers the increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease in operating expenses of  significant operating expense decreases occurred in loss on disposal of equipment  depreciation  and bad debts  offset somewhat by increases in employee compensation  and travel expenses

we intend to continue the expansion of tandy leather s retail store chain over the next several years  with plans to open at least one store in in north america 
we remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability 
in the current economic environment in the us  it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in if we determine that feasibility of additional successful openings is deemed likely

proceeds in the amount of  were used to fund the initial purchase of the property 
on april   that amount was rolled into a ten year term note  and we began making monthly debt service payments in may we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the jpmorgan chase credit agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit agreement are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  notes payable and long term debt 
reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness as well as dividend payments during the periods  our financing activities for  and required net cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
the one time  special dividend paid in july of million is the reason for the significant increase in financing activities in compared to our primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities 
net cash flow from operations for and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flow in compared to was due to the increase in inventory in the last half of in and  cash flow from operations was generated from income  partially offset by the increase in inventory 
in  cash flow from operations was generated from net income and the decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
consolidated accounts receivable remained virtually unchanged at million as of december  and average days to collect accounts increased from days in to days in on a consolidated basis 
we maintain a tight credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectability 
we believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the us economy 
many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses  and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses 
inventory increased from million at the end of to million at december  we expect our inventory to slowly trend upward as we continue our expansion both domestically as well as internationally 
in addition  we made several non routine purchases of product in the third quarter of which we are featuring in our sales promotions during the first quarter of as a result  purchases during the fourth quarter declined 
in  we expect to maintain a fairly steady inventory due to the limited number of retail stores we plan to open 
we attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected expansion 
we ended the year w ith our total inventory on hand approximately higher than our internal targets for optimal inventory 
consolidated inventory turned times during  a slight decline from the turns at times 
we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
by operating division  inventory turns are as follows segment wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft international leathercraft wholesale leathercraft stores only retail leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of wholesale leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores 
the retail stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse 
wholesale leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division  and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores 
accounts payable  totaling million  remained virtually unchanged at the end of compared to the end of as discussed above  the largest use of operating cash in was in the increase of inventory 
cash paid for capital expenditures totaled million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the primary capital expenditures were for computer equipment  software and licenses totaling  other capital expenditures were building improvements  including parking lot repaving and fence installation  and factory machines and dies 
in  the primary capital expenditure was the construction of a building to be used for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the staging of drop shipments of specially purchased product to our stores 
other capital expenditures were building improvements  i ncluding a generator  store fixtures  computer equipment  and factory machines and dies 
we intend to open one store in the united states and two to three stores abroad  and therefore will incur some capital expenditures related to these store opening  we do expect our capital expenditures to be less than that of as the expenditures related to the building have been completed 

table of contents cash applied toward stock repurchases totaled  and  in and  respectively 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in  while also funding our expansion plans 
at this time  we know of no trends or demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
in addition  we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow 
in particular  because of the relatively small investment required by each new store  we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during  and  and we do not currently have any such arrangements

therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  tandy leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than what we project  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
we periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carrying value 
as of december   we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the operating divisions associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual financial performance of these divisions differs significantly from our projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the sec  or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
words such as may  assume  forecast  position  predict  strategy  expect  intend  plan  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  budget  potential  or continue  and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking stat ements 
they can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties 
consequently  no forward looking statements can be guaranteed 
actual results may vary materially 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
we do not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiaries in canada and the united kingdom as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning our foreign activities 
interest rate risk in the past  we have been subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt 
however  our current credit agreement with jpmorgan chase includes a fixed interest rate 
therefore  changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area
