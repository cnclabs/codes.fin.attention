overview we are a biotechnology company committed to developing small molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer 
we are focusing our resources and development efforts exclusively on cabozantinib xl  our most advanced solely owned product candidate  in order to maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of this compound 
we believe cabozantinib has the potential to be a high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical product that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients 
we have also established a portfolio of other novel compounds that we believe have the potential to address serious unmet medical needs 
cabozantinib inhibits met  vegfr and ret  proteins that are key drivers of tumor growth and or vascularization 
cabozantinib is the most advanced inhibitor of met in clinical development and is being evaluated in a broad development program encompassing multiple cancer indications 
the current clinical program for cabozantinib is focused on the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and ovarian cancer  based on encouraging interim data that has emerged from a randomized discontinuation trial investigating cabozantinib in nine distinct tumor types 
cabozantinib is also being studied in an ongoing global phase registration trial in medullary thyroid cancer 
we expect to release top line results from the phase trial in the first half of and to potentially submit a new drug application  or nda  for cabozantinib as a treatment for medullary thyroid cancer in the united states in the second half of based on the strength of our expertise in biology  drug discovery and development  we have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including bristol myers squibb company  sanofi aventis  genentech  inc a wholly owned member of the roche group  boehringer ingelheim gmbh  glaxosmithkline and daiichi sankyo company limited for the majority of the remaining compounds and programs in our portfolio 
pursuant to these collaborations  we have out licensed compounds or programs to a partner for further development and commercialization  generally have no further unfunded cost obligations related to such compounds or programs and may be entitled to receive research funding  milestones and royalties or a share of profits from commercialization 
our strategy is to aggressively advance cabozantinib through development toward commercialization 
in doing so  we will pursue a pragmatic development plan focused on those cancer indications where we believe cabozantinib has the greatest near term therapeutic and commercial potential 
we are aggressively managing our expenses to preserve our cash resources and ensure we are appropriately dedicating those resources towards successfully executing our strategy 

table of contents in furtherance of our decision to focus on cabozantinib and aggressively manage our expenses  in december we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of our workforce by employees 
personnel reductions were made across our entire organization  including discovery  development and general administrative  or g a departments 
further personnel reductions are expected to be made through the end of as we complete our obligations under collaboration agreements and withdraw resources from completed projects 
with the exception of activities related to cabozantinib  we are discontinuing efforts with respect to all of our compounds and programs that are not funded by partners pursuant to collaboration agreements and are actively pursuing collaborations or other external opportunities for the continued development of these compounds and programs 
discovery and clinical activities under various collaborations will continue at funded levels until we complete our contractual obligations 
such funded programs include xl  xl and isoform selective pik inhibitors in collaboration with sanofi aventis  our sphingosine phosphate type receptor  or sp receptor  collaboration with boehringer ingelheim and xl and our ror collaboration with bristol myers squibb company 
certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability  particularly with respect to cabozantinib  and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
our financial performance is driven by many factors  including those described below 
clinical development of cabozantinib and other product candidates in december  we entered into a worldwide collaboration with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl upon effectiveness of the collaboration agreement in december  bristol myers squibb made a nonrefundable upfront cash payment of million for the development and commercialization rights to both programs 
the agreement required bristol myers squibb to make additional license payments to us of million  which were received during on june   we regained full rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib under our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb following receipt of notice from bristol myers squibb of its decision to terminate the collaboration  solely as to cabozantinib  on a worldwide basis 
bristol myers squibb informed us that the termination was based upon its review of cabozantinib in the context of bristol myers squibb s overall research and development priorities and pipeline products 
on june   in connection with the termination  we received a million transition payment from bristol myers squibb in satisfaction of its obligations under the collaboration agreement to continue to fund its share of development costs for cabozantinib for a period of three months following the notice of termination 
as a result of the termination  bristol myers squibb s license relating to cabozantinib terminated and its rights to cabozantinib reverted to us  and we received  subject to certain terms and conditions  licenses from bristol myers squibb to research  develop and commercialize cabozantinib 
we are focusing our resources and development efforts on the development of cabozantinib 
however  the product candidate may fail to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the initiation or completion of clinical trials is difficult  and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of cabozantinib depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
we expect to incur increased expenses for the development of cabozantinib as it advances in clinical development 
with the exception of activities related to cabozantinib  we are discontinuing efforts with respect to all of our compounds and programs that are not funded by partners pursuant to collaboration agreements and are 
table of contents actively pursuing collaborations or other external opportunities for the continued development of these compounds and programs 
discovery and clinical activities under various collaborations are expected to continue at funded levels until we complete our contractual obligations 
we do not expect to conduct funded activities for partners under future collaborations 
limited sources of revenues we have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues to date from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our near term revenues  such as research and development funding  license fees and milestone payments and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our current and potential future partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and depend on many factors  including the following the progress and scope of the development activity with respect to cabozantinib  whether we repay amounts outstanding under our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline in cash or shares of our common stock  whether we elect to pay cash or to issue shares of our common stock in respect of any conversion of our principal  prepayments or payments of interest in connection with the secured convertible notes we issued to entities affiliated with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  under the note purchase agreement  whether we elect to prepay the amounts advanced under our loan from silicon valley bank  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  and whether we enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements or other arrangements including in particular with respect to cabozantinib that provide additional capital 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by financial covenants in our loan and security agreement  as amended  with glaxosmithkline  our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and our note purchase agreement with the deerfield  as well as other factors  which are described under liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 

table of contents deerfield facility on june   we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which  on july   we sold to deerfield an aggregate of million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes due june for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
the outstanding principal amount of the notes bears interest in the annual amount of million  payable quarterly in arrears 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments on the notes on an annual basis in  and equal to of certain revenues from our collaborative arrangements received during the prior fiscal year  subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of million and  for payments due in january and  a minimum prepayment amount of million 
we may also prepay all or a portion not less than million of the principal amount of the notes at an optional prepayment price based on a discounted principal amount during the first three years of the term  subject to a prepayment premium determined as of the date of prepayment  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus in the case of a prepayment of the full principal amount of the notes other than prepayments upon the occurrence of specified transactions relating to a change of control or a substantial sale of assets  all accrued interest that would have accrued between the date of such prepayment and the next anniversary of the note purchase agreement 
in lieu of making any optional or mandatory prepayment in cash  at any time after july   subject to certain limitations including a cap on the number of shares issuable under the note purchase agreement  we have the right to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into  or satisfy all or any portion of the optional prepayment amounts or mandatory prepayment amounts other than the first million of mandatory prepayments required in and with shares of our common stock 
additionally  in lieu of making any payment of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the notes in cash  at any time after july   subject to certain limitations  we may elect to satisfy any such payment with shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or in settlement of principal and interest obligations will be based upon the discounted trading price of our common stock over a specified trading period 
upon certain changes of control of our company  a sale or transfer of assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions for a purchase price of more than million or a sale or transfer of more than of our assets  deerfield may require us to prepay the notes at the optional prepayment price  plus accrued and unpaid interest and any other accrued and reimbursable expenses  or the put price 
upon an event of default  deerfield may declare all or a portion of the put price to be immediately due and payable 
we also entered into a security agreement in favor of deerfield which provides that our obligations under the notes will be secured by substantially all of our assets except intellectual property 
the note purchase agreement and the security agreement include customary representations and warranties and covenants made by us  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
loan agreement with silicon valley bank on june   we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan accrues interest at per annum  which interest is due and payable monthly 
we are required to repay the term loan in one balloon principal payment  representing of the principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest  on may  we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment and the interest on the entire principal balance of the term loan that would otherwise have been paid after such prepayment date until the maturity date of the term loan 
we are required to maintain at all times on deposit in a non interest bearing demand deposit account s with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates a compensating balance  which constitutes support for the obligations under the term loan  with a principal balance in value equal to at least of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
any amounts outstanding under the term loan during the continuance of an event of default under the loan and security agreement will  at the election of silicon valley bank  bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 
if one or more events of 
table of contents default under the loan and security agreement occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period  silicon valley bank may declare all or part of the obligations under the loan and security agreement to be immediately due and payable and stop advancing money or extending credit to us under the loan and security agreement 
we are also required to maintain at all times on deposit in a non interest bearing demand deposit account s with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates  funds equal to the amount of proceeds we have drawn with respect to equipment lines of credit under our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
sanofi aventis in may  we entered into a global license agreement with sanofi aventis for xl and xl and a broad collaboration for the discovery of inhibitors of pik for the treatment of cancer 
the license agreement and collaboration agreement became effective on july  in connection with the effectiveness of the license and collaboration  on july   we received upfront payments of million million for the license and million for the collaboration  less applicable withholding taxes of million  for a net receipt of million 
we expect to receive a refund payment from the french government in with respect to the withholding taxes previously withheld 
under the license agreement  sanofi aventis received a worldwide exclusive license to xl and xl  which are in phase  phase b and phase clinical trials  and has sole responsibility for all subsequent clinical  regulatory  commercial and manufacturing activities 
sanofi aventis is responsible for funding all development activities with respect to xl and xl  including our activities 
following the effectiveness of the license agreement  we have been conducting the majority of the clinical trials for xl and xl at the expense of sanofi aventis 
as provided for under the license agreement however  the parties have agreed to transition all future development activities for these compounds to sanofi aventis 
the parties anticipate that the transition will be completed by the end of the second quarter of as a result of the transition of development activities to sanofi aventis  we expect to no longer receive reimbursements from sanofi aventis with respect to xl and xl and we plan to reduce our development capacity such that no further operating expenses will be incurred in connection with these programs once the transition is complete 
under the collaboration agreement  the parties agreed to combine efforts in establishing several pre clinical pik programs and jointly share responsibility for research and preclinical activities related to isoform selective inhibitors of pik a and 
sanofi aventis will continue to provide us with guaranteed annual research and development funding during the research term and is responsible for funding all development activities for each product following approval of the investigational new drug  or ind  application filed with the applicable regulatory authorities for such product 
we are entitled to receive guaranteed research funding of million over three years to cover certain of our costs under the collaboration agreement 
sanofi aventis will have sole responsibility for all subsequent clinical  regulatory  commercial and manufacturing activities of any products arising from the collaboration  however  we may be requested to conduct certain clinical trials at sanofi aventis expense 
the research term under the collaboration is three years  although sanofi aventis has the right to extend the term for an additional one year period upon prior written notice 
for both the license and the collaboration combined  we will be eligible to receive development  regulatory and commercial milestones of over billion in the aggregate  as well as royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license or collaboration 
sanofi aventis may  upon certain prior notice to us  terminate the license as to products containing xl or xl in the event of such termination election  sanofi aventis license relating to such product would terminate and revert to us  and we would receive  subject to certain terms  conditions and potential payment obligations  licenses from sanofi aventis to research  develop and commercialize such products 

table of contents the collaboration will automatically terminate under certain circumstances upon the expiration of the research term  in which case all licenses granted by the parties to each other would terminate and revert to the respective party  subject to sanofi aventis right to receive  under certain circumstances  the first opportunity to obtain a license from us to any isoform selective pik inhibitor 
in addition  sanofi aventis may  upon certain prior written notice to us  terminate the collaboration in whole or as to certain products following expiration of the research term  in which case we would receive  subject to certain terms  conditions and potential payment obligations by us  licenses from sanofi aventis to research  develop and commercialize such products 
restructurings as a consequence of our ongoing efforts to manage costs and our strategy to focus our resources and development efforts on the development of our most advanced solely owned product candidate  cabozantinib  we implemented two restructuring plans during resulting in an aggregate reduction of employees 
in connection with the december restructuring plan  further personnel reductions are expected to be made through the end of as we complete our obligations under collaboration agreements and withdraw resources from completed projects 
we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of approximately million during of which million related to termination benefits and million related to facility related charges and other impairment charges 
with respect to the march restructuring  we expect to incur an additional restructuring charge of million relating to the sublease and exit of one of our south san francisco buildings 
with respect to the december restructuring  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in the range of million to million  including facility related charges in connection with the anticipated sublease and exit of two of our south san francisco buildings and million related to additional termination benefits 
as of december   the restructuring plans have resulted in aggregate cash expenditures of million 
for the march restructuring  we expect to pay an additional million  of which million relates to facility costs  net of cash received from our subtenant 
for the december restructuring plan  we expect to incur aggregate cash expenditures in the range of million to million  of which approximately million related to termination benefits was paid in the fourth quarter of  approximately million related to termination benefits is expected to be paid during the first three quarters of and the balance  related to facility costs  is expected to be paid through the restructuring charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring plans are subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructuring plan 
glaxosmithkline loan repayment obligations in october  we entered into a collaboration with glaxosmithkline to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of vascular biology  inflammatory disease and oncology 
as part of the collaboration  we entered into a loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  pursuant to which we borrowed million for use in our efforts under the collaboration 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is secured by certain intellectual property  technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration 
on october   we paid approximately million in cash to glaxosmithkline as the second of three installments of principal and accrued interest due under the loan agreement 
after giving effect to all repayments made  as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under the loan was million 
the final installment of principal and accrued interest under the loan is due october  repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under the loan agreement may  at our election  be made in the form of our common stock at fair market value  subject to certain conditions  or cash 
in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed  we may not be able to repay the loan in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to repay the loan may result in significant dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our repayment obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay amounts outstanding under the loan when due or that we will satisfy the conditions to our ability to repay the loan in shares of our common stock 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from three primary sources license fees  milestone payments and collaborative agreement reimbursements 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front license fees and milestone payments received under various collaboration agreements 
we initially recognize upfront fees received from third party collaborators as unearned revenues and then recognize these amounts on a ratable basis over the expected term of the research collaboration 
therefore  any changes in the expected term of the research collaboration will impact revenue recognition for the given period 
for example  in the second quarter of  the estimated research term under our collaboration agreement with boehringer ingelheim was extended through march  resulting in an extension in the period over which we will recognize license revenues and decreasing our license revenues recognized each quarter to million  down from million 
often  the total research term is not contractually defined and an estimate of the term of our total obligation must be made 
for example  under the cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb  we estimated our term to be through august  which is the estimated term of our performance obligations for xl we estimate that this is the period over which we are obligated to perform services and therefore the appropriate term with which to ratably recognize any license fees 
during the fourth quarter of  this estimate was extended to april as a result of the decision with bristol myers squibb to complete additional phase trial programs for xl license fees are classified as license revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
although milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the expected research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of a milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenues 
other companies have adopted an alternative milestone revenue recognition policy  whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenues recognized 
in certain situations  we may receive milestone payments after 
table of contents the end of our period of continued involvement 
in such circumstances  we would recognize of the milestone revenues when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenues consist of research and development support received from collaborators 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenues are recorded as earned based on the performance requirements by both parties under the respective contracts 
under the cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb and prior to its termination by bristol myers squibb as to cabozantinib  certain research and development expenses were partially reimbursable to us 
on an annual basis  the amounts that bristol myers squibb owed us  net of amounts reimbursable to bristol myers squibb by us on those projects  were recorded as revenues 
conversely  research and development expenses included the net settlement of amounts we owed bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred on joint development projects  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb on such projects 
in annual periods when net research and development funding payments were payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments were presented as collaboration cost sharing expense 
reimbursements under co development agreements were classified as collaboration reimbursement revenues  while reimbursements under other arrangements were classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
notwithstanding termination by bristol myers squibb  revenues from the cancer collaboration will continue to be determined and reflected on an annual basis 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  in  under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue as a result of the development term concluding on the earliest scheduled end date of october   instead of the previously estimated end date of october  clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  review of contractual terms and correspondence with cros 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 
such increases or decreases in expenses are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first known 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction related to prior periods of approximately million to our accrued clinical trial liabilities and research and development expenses primarily related to our phase and phase clinical trials for cabozantinib 

table of contents restructuring liability in connection with our restructuring activities  we estimate facility related restructuring charges which represent the present value of the estimated facility costs for which we would obtain no future economic benefit offset by estimated future sublease income  including any credit or debit relating to existing deferred rent balances associated with the vacated building 
we derive our estimates based primarily on discussions with our brokers and our own view of market conditions based in part on discussions with potential subtenants 
these estimates require significant assumptions regarding the time required to contract with subtenants  the amount of idle space we would be able to sublease and potential future sublease rates 
the present value factor  which also affects the level of accreted interest expense that we will recognize as additional restructuring charges over the term of the lease  is based on our estimate of our credit risk adjusted borrowing rate at the time the initial lease related restructuring liability is calculated 
changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates could have a material impact on our restructuring charge and restructuring liability 
we are required to continue to update our estimate of our restructuring liability in future periods as conditions warrant  and we expect to further revise our estimate in future periods as we continue our discussions with potential subtenants 
in addition  in connection with our sublease efforts for two of our buildings in south san francisco  if we sublease these facilities for rates that are not significantly in excess of our costs  we would not likely recover the carrying value of certain assets associated with these facilities 
as such  we could potentially recognize additional asset impairment charges  in future periods  if we were to sublease parts of both of these buildings 
stock option valuation our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be materially different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
table of contents years in addition to million of total unrecognized compensation expense relating to restricted stock units  or rsus  which was expected to be recognized over years 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion regarding stock based compensation

table of contents the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis for xl  xl and the discovery of inhibitors of pik 
in addition to the increase resulting from our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis  we also recognized increases in revenues of million due to increased collaboration cost sharing reimbursements relating to our cancer collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl these increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in license revenues relating to our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim and our amended cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb  as well as the conclusion of our mek collaboration with genentech 
in addition  we had a decline in milestone and contract revenues related to our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb and the completion of revenue recognition under our lxr collaboration with bristol myers squibb 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to our may collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis for the discovery of inhibitors of pik 
we also recognized increases of million in revenues from our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb relating to cabozantinib and xl and million in revenues from our may collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by decreases in milestone and contract revenues relating to the conclusion of certain collaborations with glaxosmithkline  genentech and bristol myers squibb  in addition to a decline in research and development funding relating to fewer full time equivalent employees under our lxr collaboration with bristol myers squibb 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  research and development expenses dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial expenses  personnel expenses  consulting expenses  laboratory supplies  general corporate costs  stock based compensation and facility costs 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from the following personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  decreased by million  or  primarily due to a reduction in headcount resulting from our restructuring implemented in march general corporate costs there was a decrease of million  or  in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facility costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  primarily as a result of a decrease in personnel and the exit of certain facilities in san diego and south san francisco  as a result of our march restructuring plan  and the resulting decrease in costs to be allocated 
laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures as a result of our march restructuring plan 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  as a result of our reduction in headcount from our restructuring implemented in march these decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial expenses and a decline in cost reimbursements 
clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  increased by million  or  primarily due to increased phase and 
table of contents phase clinical trial activity for cabozantinib and increased phase clinical trial activity for xl these increases were partially offset by reduced activities associated with sei related compounds  for which the arrangement ended in  as well as a decline in activities associated with various other compounds 
in addition  an increase in research and development funding of was recognized as a reduction to research and development expenses in  which primarily related to our contract research agreement with agrigenetics  inc  or agrigenetics  which ended in the research and development funding  which stems from our agreement with a third party relating to the sale of our cell factory business  ended in the second quarter of the change in compared to resulted primarily from the following clinical trials clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  decreased by million  or  primarily due to the wind down of activities associated with xl  xl  xl and xl clinical trials  the transfer of xl to glaxosmithkline in  the transfer of xl to genentech in march  and non clinical toxicology studies conducted in on xl these decreases were partially offset by an increase in phase and phase clinical trial activities for cabozantinib  ind activity for xl  increased phase clinical trial activity for xl and increased phase clinical trial activity related to xl  xl and xl personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  decreased by million  or  primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our restructuring in november laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures as a result of our november restructuring plan 
cost reimbursement primarily as a result of our contract research agreement with agrigenetics  we received an increase in research and development funding of million that was recognized as a reduction to research and development expense 
we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each of our research and development programs 
we group our research and development expenses into three categories drug discovery  development and other 
our drug discovery group utilizes a variety of high throughput technologies to enable the rapid discovery  optimization and extensive characterization of lead compounds such that we are able to select development candidates with the best potential for further evaluation and advancement into clinical development 
drug discovery expenses relate primarily to personnel expense  lab supplies and general corporate costs 
our development group leads the development and implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trial  personnel and general corporate costs 
the other category primarily includes stock based compensation expense 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expenses described above  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs 
such factors include enrollment in clinical trials for our drug candidates  the results of and data from clinical trials  the potential indications for our drug candidates  the therapeutic and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which historically included the pursuit of commercial collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development of our drug candidates 
as noted under overview  we are focusing our resources and development efforts exclusively on cabozantinib in order to maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of this compound 
our strategy is to aggressively advance cabozantinib through development toward commercialization  and as a result  we expect nearly all of our future research and development expenses to relate to the clinical development of cabozantinib 

table of contents the expenditures summarized in the following table reflect total research and development expenses by category  including allocations for general and administrative expense dollar amounts are presented in millions inception to date drug discovery development other total inception is as of january   the date on which we began tracking research and development expenses by category 
while we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each program  beginning in fiscal  we began tracking third party expenditures directly relating to each program as a way of monitoring external costs 
our third party research and development expenditures relate principally to our clinical trial and related development activities  such as preclinical and clinical studies and contract manufacturing  and represent only a portion of the costs related to each program 
third party expenditures for programs initiated prior to the beginning of fiscal have not been tracked from project inception  and therefore such expenditures from the actual inception for most of our programs are not available 
we do not accumulate on a program specific basis internal research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel expenses  facilities overhead expenses and external costs not directly attributable to a specific project 
nevertheless  we believe that third party expenditures by program provide a reasonable estimate of the percentage of our total research and development expenses that are attributable to each such program 
for fiscal year  the programs representing the greatest portion of our external third party research and development expenditures were cabozantinib  xl  xl  xl and xl 
the expenses for these programs were primarily included in the development category of our research and development expenses and exclude the impact of any amounts reimbursed by our partners 
we do not have reliable estimates regarding the timing of our clinical trials 
we estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
in general  we will incur increased research and development expenses for compounds that advance in clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
we do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar decrease percentage decrease 
table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  employee stock based compensation expense  facility costs and consulting and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased personnel and facility costs related to our march restructuring  partially offset by a change in the allocation of overhead expenses as a result of our march restructuring in addition to a slight increase in patent costs 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our restructuring in november  reduced consulting and outside service costs  and other cost saving measures 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in rent and other facility costs associated with our properties 
collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses total collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  collaboration reimbursements cost sharing expenses dollar change percentage change not meaningful not meaningful not meaningful collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses consist of research and development expenses and reimbursements related to our cancer collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl to the extent that net annual research and development funding payments are expected to be received from bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration reimbursement revenues 
for the year ended december   when net research and development expenses were payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments were presented as collaboration cost sharing expenses 
for the year ending december   we received net collaboration reimbursements and have recorded collaboration reimbursement revenues of million which included the million transition payment received from bristol myers squibb upon termination of our cancer collaboration with respect to cabozantinib 
we do not expect any further collaboration cost sharing reimbursements to be recognized as revenues with respect to cabozantinib 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net payable to bristol myers squibb  resulting in an increase in operating expenses of million 
restructuring charge total restructuring charge expenses from restructurings plans were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  restructuring charge dollar change percentage change not meaningful not meaningful not meaningful december on december   we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of our workforce by employees  of which  as of february   employees are continuing to provide services through 
table of contents various dates in further personnel reductions are expected to be made through the end of as we complete our obligations under collaboration agreements and withdraw resources from completed projects 
the restructuring plan is a consequence of our decision to focus our resources and development efforts on the late stage development and commercialization of our most advanced solely owned product candidate  cabozantinib 
in connection with the december restructuring plan  we expect to record an aggregate restructuring charge related to termination benefits and equipment write downs of approximately million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of and the remainder is expected to be recorded in the first three quarters of this includes an aggregate charge of million  million of which was recorded in  relating to the modification of certain stock option awards previously granted to the terminated employees  extending the time period over which the employees are allowed to exercise their options through the end of september in addition  we recorded approximately million in impairment charges related to leasehold improvements and excess laboratory equipment 
we expect to incur additional charges in the range of million to million as a result of the december restructuring plan  including facility related charges in connection with the anticipated sublease and exit of two of our buildings in south san francisco  california and million related to additional termination benefits 
we expect to record the termination benefits and a majority of the facility related charges as they are determined during the fiscal year we also plan to auction off any excess equipment  the net proceeds of which may offset some of these future charges 
we expect that the december restructuring plan will result in aggregate cash expenditures in the range of million to million  of which approximately million related to termination benefits was paid in the fourth quarter of  approximately million related to termination benefits is expected to be paid during the first three quarters of and the balance  related to facility costs  is expected to be paid through see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
march on march   we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately  or employees 
a small number of the terminated employees were subsequently recalled and the termination of a small group of employees was delayed until february the remaining impacted employees were terminated immediately upon implementation of the plan or by march  the decision to restructure our operations in march was based on our early corporate strategy to focus our efforts on our lead clinical compounds  cabozantinib  xl and xl  by dedicating the majority of our resources to aggressively drive these drug candidates through development towards commercialization 
in connection with the march restructuring plan  we recorded a charge of approximately million in  of which approximately million was recorded in the first quarter of primarily related to termination benefits  which includes the modification of certain stock option awards previously granted to the terminated employees 
the modification accelerates the vesting of any stock options that would have vested over the period beginning from cessation of employment through august  employees also received an additional two months to exercise their options  for which a small charge was taken 
the remainder of the charge was principally for the impairment of various assets and for non cash charges relating to the closure of our facility in san diego  california and the exit from one of our buildings in south san francisco  california 
we expect that the march restructuring plan will result in total cash expenditures of approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in the balance will be paid over an additional five years and primarily relates to net payments due under the lease for the building we exited in south san francisco 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents the restructuring charges that we expect to incur in connection with our march and december restructuring plans are subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructuring plans

in addition  interest expense declined with the termination of our facility agreement with deerfield in november and the payment of million in cash to glaxosmithkline in october as the second of three installments of principal and accrued interest due under our loan agreement with glaxosmithkline 
this was partially offset by increased interest in association with the new deerfield loan entered into in june the change in total other income expense  net for compared to resulted primarily from the recording of a million loss upon deconsolidation of sei as a result of the expiration of our purchase option for sei in june and million in interest expense relating to the termination of our facility agreement with deerfield in november lower interest rates led to a decline in interest income of million and we also recorded a net adjustment of million to the gain on the sale of our plant trait business  and the sale of our stake in artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  which represents the difference between the million recorded in and the million recorded in income tax benefit provision year ended december  tax benefit dollar change percentage change not meaningful not meaningful not meaningful the income tax benefit for is an adjustment of million relating to million tax credit recorded in as a result of the housing and economic recovery act of this act was not extended beyond  so no further tax benefits are expected 
we have incurred net losses since inception and have therefore not recorded any tax provision for  or 
table of contents under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in  we licensed three of our compounds  xl  xl and xl  to sei in return for an million investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
as part of the agreement  we received an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the equity of sei  thereby allowing us to reacquire xl  xl and xl at our sole discretion 
the purchase option expired on june  the expiration of the purchase option triggered a reconsideration event regarding our need to consolidate sei  a variable interest entity 
upon the expiration of the purchase option  we no longer held a variable interest in the variable interest entity 
accordingly  we deconsolidated sei and derecognized the sei assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest from our financial statements 
for the years ended december    and  the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders were zero  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in from in the losses attributable to noncontrolling interest holders was due to the deconsolidation of sei in june the decrease in from in the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was primarily due to decreased development expenses associated with xl and xl liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended december   and dollar amounts are presented in thousands year ended december  consolidated net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  at end of year to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators and banks  and equipment financing facilities 
we have also financed certain of our research and development activities under our agreements with various collaborators and sei 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 

table of contents operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million  to decreases in deferred revenues of million  to declines in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and gains recognized in association with our transaction with agrigenetics and for the sale of our plant trait business 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  accretion of implied interest under our note purchase agreement with deerfield  and impairment of assets due to our march and december restructuring plans 
in addition  we recognized a restructuring liability of million primarily relating to the exit from one of our south san francisco buildings in connection with our march restructuring plan and termination benefits from our december restructuring plan  in addition to a decrease in other receivables 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million offset by increases in deferred revenues and other non cash charges 
the decrease in our consolidated net loss was driven by an increase in revenues primarily due to our collaboration with sanofi aventis relating to xl and xl and our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb relating to cabozantinib and xl  in addition to an overall decrease in operating expenses 
these uses of cash were primarily offset by a net increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily driven by receipt of an upfront cash payment of million related to the global license agreement and collaboration with sanofi aventis  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue from the ratable recognition of deferred revenues over the period of continuing involvement from our various collaborations 
in addition  cash uses were offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  and a million loss that we recorded upon deconsolidation of sei 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million 
the increase in our net loss was primarily driven by the continued advancement and expansion of our clinical trial activity in addition to the inclusion in of the million gain on the sale of assets recognized in conjunction with our transaction with agrigenetics  which was accounted for as a sale of our plant trait business  and million gain on the sale of of artemis 
these uses of cash were primarily offset by a net increase in deferred revenue of million primarily driven by receipt of an upfront cash payment of million related to the cabozantinib and xl collaboration with bristol myers squibb  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue from the ratable recognition of deferred revenues over the period of continuing involvement from our various collaborations 
in particular  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue relating to the conclusion of our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  for which the development term concluded on october  in addition  cash uses were offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses as well as non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
while cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our consolidated net loss  operating cash flows differ from our consolidated net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition and non cash charges 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  primarily with respect to manufacturing and development expenses for cabozantinib 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december   and cash provided of million for cash used by investing activities for was primarily driven by the purchase of million of marketable securities and certificates of deposit 
these uses of cash were offset by proceeds from the maturity of 
table of contents marketable securities of million in addition to the sale of investments prior to maturity of million and proceeds of million associated with our transaction with agrigenetics and the sale of our cell factory business in the proceeds provided by the sale and maturity of our investments were used to fund our operations 
additionally  in line with our focus on managing our cash resources  purchase of property and equipment were significantly lower in and than compared to prior years 
cash used in investing activities for was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of million 
most of the cash invested in marketable securities was generated by payments received from collaborators 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and on sales of investments held by sei  for a combined cash inflow of million used to fund our operations 
cash provided in investing activities for was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale and maturities of marketable securities of million and the sale of million of investments held by sei  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
in addition  in september we received a million anniversary payment plus an additional million of contingent consideration in association with our transaction with agrigenetics 
the proceeds provided by maturities or sale of our marketable securities and the sale of investments by sei were used to fund our operations 
we expect to continue to make moderate investments in property and equipment to support our operations 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december   and cash provided of million for cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to our loan agreement with silicon valley bank  the sale of secured convertible notes to deerfield for proceeds of million  proceeds from the sale of exelixis stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and proceeds from employee option exercises of million 
these cash inflows were offset by principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
cash used by our financing activities for was primarily due to principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million partially offset by proceeds from notes payable and bank obligations of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase plan purchases of million 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to proceeds of million from our notes payable and bank obligations and million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
these increases were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes  bank obligations and our loan from glaxosmithkline 
in june  we entered into the facility agreement with deerfield for which deerfield agreed to loan us up to million  subject to certain conditions 
the facility agreement was terminated in november  resulting in a million charge to interest expense relating to a cancellation fee and outstanding warrants 
we did not draw on the facility agreement at any time prior to its termination 
in  we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
in addition  we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which we sold to deerfield  an aggregate million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
see note for additional details on these agreements 

table of contents cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss attributable to exelixis  inc of million for the year ended december  while we expect our net loss in to decrease compared to  we anticipate negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors that may require us to use available capital resources significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
these factors include the cabozantinib development program we are focusing our resources and development efforts on cabozantinib  our most advanced solely owned product candidate  which is being studied in a variety of tumor types  with the goal of rapidly commercializing the compound 
the current clinical program for cabozantinib is focused on the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and ovarian cancer  based on encouraging interim data that has emerged from the rdt 
data from the rdt were released at the asco annual meeting in june and demonstrated broad activity for cabozantinib across multiple tumor types  in particular  metastatic castration resistant prostate  ovarian  non small cell lung and hepatocellular cancers and hepatoma 
updated interim data presented at the eortc symposium and at the asco genitourinary cancers symposium in february  suggest that cabozantinib has a novel and differentiated clinical profile in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and ovarian cancer 
the data presented indicate that cabozantinib has shown novel activity against bone and soft tissue lesions in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
another priority for us will be to generate additional data in the various other cohorts of the rdt  including melanoma  breast cancer  non small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular cancer  to support further prioritization of our clinical and commercial options 
we also are focusing our efforts on our ongoing phase clinical trial of cabozantinib as a potential treatment for medullary thyroid cancer 
in addition  we are conducting ongoing exploratory clinical trials for cabozantinib in other tumor types  including renal cell carcinoma 
our development plan for cabozantinib is dependent on the extent of our available financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources independently or through other arrangements to fund a broad development plan for cabozantinib 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  discontinue or elect not to pursue one or more trials for cabozantinib  repayment of our loan from glaxosmithkline in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with glaxosmithkline 
as part of the collaboration  we entered into a loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  pursuant to which we borrowed million for use in our efforts under the collaboration 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is secured by certain intellectual property  technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration 
on october   we paid approximately million in cash to glaxosmithkline as the second of three installments of principal and accrued interest due under the loan agreement 
as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under the loan was million 
the final installment of principal and accrued interest under the loan is due on october  repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under the loan agreement may  at our election  be made in the form of our common stock at fair market value  subject to certain conditions  or cash 
in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed  we may not be able to repay the loan in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to repay the loan may result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our 
table of contents repayment obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay amounts outstanding under the loan when due or that we will satisfy the conditions to our ability to repay the loan in shares of our common stock  repayment of the notes under our note purchase agreement with deerfield on june   we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield  pursuant to which  on july   we sold to deerfield an aggregate of million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes  due june  for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses 
the outstanding principal amount of the notes bears interest in the annual amount of million  payable quarterly in arrears 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments on the notes on an annual basis in  and equal to of our collaborative arrangements received during the prior fiscal year  subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of million and  for payments due in january and  a minimum prepayment amount of million 
we may also prepay all or a portion not less than million of the principal amount of the notes at an optional prepayment price based on a discounted principal amount during the first three years of the term  subject to a prepayment premium determined as of the date of prepayment  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus in the case of a prepayment of the full principal amount of the notes other than prepayments upon the occurrence of specified transactions relating to a change of control or a substantial sale of assets  all accrued interest that would have accrued between the date of such prepayment and the next anniversary of the note purchase agreement 
in lieu of making any optional or mandatory prepayment in cash  at any time after july   subject to certain limitations  we have the right to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into  or satisfy all or any portion of the optional prepayment amounts or mandatory prepayment amounts other than the first million of mandatory prepayments required in and with shares of our common stock 
additionally  in lieu of making any payment of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the notes in cash  at any time after july   subject to certain limitations  we may elect to satisfy any such payment with shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or in settlement of principal and interest obligations will be based upon the discounted trading price of our common stock over a specified trading period 
in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed  we may not be able to convert the principal amount of the notes or satisfy our payment obligations in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to convert the notes or satisfy our payment obligations may result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our repayment obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay the notes or satisfy our payment obligations under the note purchase agreement when due or that we will comply with the conditions to our ability to convert the principal amount of the notes into or satisfy our payment obligations with shares of our common stock  repayment of our loan from silicon valley bank on june   we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in an amount of million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan accrues interest at per annum  which interest is due and payable monthly 
we are required to repay the term loan in one balloon principal payment  representing of the principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest  on may  we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment and the interest on the entire principal balance of the term loan that would otherwise have been paid after such prepayment date until the maturity date of the term loan 
in accordance with the terms of the loan and security agreement  we are also required to maintain on deposit an amount equal to at least of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan at all times as support for our obligations under the loan and security agreement 
as a result  although the proceeds of the new term loan improve our ability to comply with minimum working capital and cash covenants imposed by our debt instruments with glaxosmithkline and deerfield and thus provide us with more flexibility to use our other cash resources  the proceeds of the term loan cannot directly be used to satisfied our 
table of contents other obligations without causing a default under our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  whether we enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements or other arrangements including  in particular  with respect to cabozantinib that provide additional capital  our ability to control costs  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that serve as collateral for bank lines of credit  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies 
one or more of these factors or changes to our current operating plan may require us to use available capital resources significantly earlier than we anticipate 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through external borrowings 
in addition  we may enter into additional strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements for the development and commercialization of our compounds 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness  and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may need to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties 
as described below  the terms of our debt owed to glaxosmithkline  deerfield and silicon valley bank each contain covenants requiring us to maintain specified cash balances or levels of working capital glaxosmithkline our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline contains financial covenants pursuant to which our working capital the amount by which our current assets exceed our current liabilities as defined by the agreement  which excludes restricted cash and deferred revenue 
table of contents must not be less than million and our cash and investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments as defined by the agreement  which excludes restricted cash must not be less than million 
as of december   our working capital was million and our cash and investments were million 
if we default on the financial covenants under the loan and security agreement  glaxosmithkline may  among other remedies  declare immediately due and payable all obligations under the loan and security agreement 
outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under the loan and security agreement totaled million at december  the final installment of principal and accrued interest under the loan is due on october  deerfield our note purchase agreement with deerfield contains an event of default that would be triggered if our cash and cash equivalents fall below million as of december   subject to a cure period 
upon such an event of default  deerfield may declare all or a portion of the put price to be immediately due and payable 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of our note purchase agreement includes our total cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
we expect to adopt this guidance prospectively beginning on january  under asu  we may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining the estimated selling price of delivered items under new agreements and our revenue under new agreements may be more accelerated as compared to the prior accounting standard 
as such  the adoption of asu could have a material impact on our financial statements going forward

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash and investments of million 
our marketable securities and our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates

our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are primarily fixed and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination of both 
the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and december  as of december  and december   a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies in countries in which we conduct clinical trials 
most of our foreign expenses incurred are associated with establishing and conducting clinical trials for cabozantinib and various other compounds in our pipeline at sites outside of the united states 
our agreements with the foreign sites that conduct such clinical trials generally provide that payments for the services provided will be calculated in the currency of that country  and converted into us dollars using various exchange rates based upon when services are rendered or the timing of invoices 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases
