table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals  managing billion in client assets at december  through a variety of investment products designed to suit their investment needs 
assets under management our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management and with our ability to manage variable expenses 
the following table details our assets under management  based on the four types of investment product types we offer in the mutual fund and separate account categories  at december   and in millions mutual funds open end funds closed end funds total mutual funds separate accounts institutional accounts managed accounts total separate accounts total assets under management in order to increase our assets under management and expand our business  we must develop and market investment products and strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients investors seeking superior  risk adjusted returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract and retain clients will depend on a variety of factors  including  among others purchases and redemptions of shares of the open end funds and other investment products  the amount of distributed and reinvested capital gains and income  fluctuations in the global financial markets and the valuations of securities that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  the use of leverage within the closed end funds  our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best in class service  the relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management and broader financial services sectors  investor sentiment and confidence  and our introduction of new investment strategies and products  and our decision to close strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients 
investment products investment companies investment companies include registered open end mutual funds and registered closed end funds 
open end mutual funds 
open end funds are continually offered and are not listed on an exchange 
open end funds issue new shares for purchase and redeem shares from those shareholders who sell 
the share price for 
table of contents purchases and redemptions of open end funds is determined by each fund s net asset value  which is calculated at the end of each business day 
assets under management in open end funds vary as a result of both market appreciation and depreciation and the level of new purchases or redemptions of shares of a fund 
investment management fees  including performance based fees  are our principal source of revenue from open end mutual funds and are primarily derived from assets under management 
we offer several share classes in each open end fund to provide investors with alternatives to pay for commissions  distribution and service fees 
since our open end funds have included our dublin  ireland based calamos global funds plc  also referred to as offshore funds 
closed end funds 
closed end funds typically sell a finite number of shares to investors through underwritten public offerings 
after the public offerings  investors buy closed end fund shares from  and sell those shares to  other investors through an exchange or broker dealer market 
all of the closed end funds that we manage currently use leverage which increases their total assets 
assets under management in closed end funds vary due to the amount of assets raised in underwritten public offerings  the amount of leverage utilized and market appreciation or depreciation 
our revenues from closed end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage 
in addition  in a typical underwritten public offering  investors are charged a commission by the selling firms 
we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed end fund shares  although we may pay asset based distribution and service fees  as well as one time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed end funds 
separate accounts separate accounts include institutional accounts and managed accounts for high net worth investors 
fund flows into and out of such accounts  which we refer to as purchases and redemptions  affect our level of assets under management 
assets under management from these accounts also vary as a result of market appreciation and depreciation 
our revenues from separate accounts are derived from investment management fees that we charge  including performance based fees where applicable 
provided below is a brief differentiation of these accounts institutional accounts are separately managed accounts for institutional investors  such as public and private pension funds  public funds  endowment funds and private investment funds 
institutional accounts also include sub advised portfolios  such as registered investment companies  where we act as investment advisor but for which we have limited or no distribution responsibilities 
institutional accounts are typically offered directly by us through institutional consultants and through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker dealers 
revenues our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with the mutual funds and separate accounts managed by us 
the distribution of assets under management among our investment products also will have an impact on our investment management fees  as some products carry different fees than others 
investment management fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management  the amount of capital gain and income distributions  market appreciation or depreciation  the use of leverage within our products  relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products and strategies compared to benchmarks and competitors  level of net purchases and redemptions  which represent the sum of new client assets  additional funding from existing clients  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares  
table of contents a determination by the independent trustees of the mutual funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us  and increased competition 
our revenues also are comprised of distribution and underwriting fees 
asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  discussed below  are a significant component of distribution and underwriting fees 
distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value of our assets under management  total composition of our assets under management by share class  market appreciation or depreciation  and the level of purchases and redemptions 
investment management fees investment management fees that we receive from mutual funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis 
investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor are generally computed quarterly  either in advance or in arrears  based on the assets under management at the beginning or end of the quarterly period 
we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services 
distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees include asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  front end sales charges and contingent deferred sales charges 
rule b distribution and or service fees are asset based fees that the open end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act 
these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets under management in specific share classes of the open end funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets under management and the relative mix of assets among share classes 
rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period  as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions that were previously paid by us to third parties 
we earn front end sales charges on the sale of class a shares of open end funds  which provide for a sales charge at the time of investment 
we retain a portion of the applicable sales charge and record as underwriting revenue only the portion that we retain 
we retain the entire sales charge earned on accounts where calamos financial services acts as the broker dealer 
sales charges are waived on sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum dollar amounts and other specified conditions 
sales charges fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without a sales charge 
contingent deferred sales charges are earned on redemptions of class b shares within six years of purchase and on redemptions of class c shares within one year of purchase 
contingent deferred sales charges fluctuate primarily based on the length of the investment in class b and class c shares 
waivers of contingent deferred sales charges apply under certain circumstances 
other revenues other revenues consist primarily of portfolio accounting fees  which are contractual payments calculated as a percentage of combined assets of the mutual funds for financial accounting services  such as establishing expense accruals and performing tax calculations 
the fees were calculated based on the average daily assets of the open end and closed end funds 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  distribution expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
these expenses fluctuate due to a number of factors  including but not limited to  the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  incentive compensation  changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors  changes in distribution expense and amortization of the deferred sales commissions as a result of fluctuations in mutual fund sales and level of redemptions  market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management which will directly impact distribution expenses  the amount of rule b distribution and or service fees that we receive  as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future  which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees  changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to further penetrate and support new and existing distribution channels and clients  and expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  professional services  depreciation  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
we have and will continue to adjust the level of expenses relative to business income and continue to seek opportunities to implement a more variable cost structure 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation and related benefits costs 
employee compensation and benefits are benchmarked against the competitive market landscape  including industry compensation standards 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefits 
in normal circumstances  we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefits expenses over the long term 
we use a fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options granted under our incentive stock plan 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units 
distribution expenses distribution expenses include payments that we make to broker dealers and other intermediaries for selling  underwriting  servicing and administering mutual funds 
this expense is influenced by new mutual funds sales  levels of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management in these products 
this expense is comprised of rule b distribution and or service fee payments to the selling firms 
amortization of deferred sales commissions as discussed above  we pay commissions to selling firms upon the sale of class b and c shares of open end funds 
as we pay these commissions  we create a deferred sales commission asset on our balance sheet 
we amortize these assets over either the average remaining lives of the assets or the period in which we receive related asset based distribution and or service fees pursuant to rule b plans 
amortization expenses generally offset the rule b fees we receive from the funds shareholders over this same period 
in addition  because rule b fees cease upon the redemption of open end fund shares  amortization expenses are accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in an increase in amortization expense and a reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 

table of contents because we discontinued the sale of class b shares during  the deferred sales commission assets related to these shares are no longer replenished by new sales 
in conjunction with this decision  we evaluated the estimated remaining lives on the portion of the deferred sales commission assets related to class b mutual fund shares and  as a result of this evaluation  extended the estimated remaining lives of these assets 
the impact of this change in estimate reduced amortization expense beginning in the year ended december  other operating expenses other operating expenses include marketing and sales promotion expenses and general and administrative expenses 
marketing and sales promotion expenses generally vary based on the type and level of marketing  educational  sales or other programs in operation and include closed end fund marketing costs and ongoing and one time payments to broker dealers 
in addition  as the open end mutual funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition over time and in normal circumstances  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents  which are a component of marketing and sales promotion expense 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to fluctuate with changes in assets under management 
in connection with closed end funds  we make fee payments to certain underwriters for distribution  consulting and or support services rendered during or after the offering period of each closed end fund 
these fees are based on contractual agreements with underwriting firms and may be paid over time based on the average daily net assets of such funds or at the close of the offering period based on the amount of assets raised during the offering 
general and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy related costs  depreciation and professional and business services 
these expenses generally increase and decrease in relative proportion to the number of employees retained by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations 
given our continued efforts to make these costs more variable  such as outsourcing our middle and back office functions  we expect to see an increase in professional services related expenses 
this increase is likely to be offset by a decrease in fixed compensation expenses 
impact of distribution and underwriting activities in order to gather assets under management  we engage in distribution and underwriting activities  principally with respect to our family of open end mutual funds 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we present distribution fees earned by us as revenues and distribution fees paid to selling firms and the amortization of deferred sales commissions as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  when analyzing our business  we consider the result of these distribution activities as a net amount of revenue as they are typically a result of a single open end mutual fund share purchase 
hence  the result of presenting this information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is a reduction to our overall operating margin  as the margin on distribution activities is generally lower than the margins on our core investment management business 
the following table summarizes the net distribution fee margin for the years ended december  and in thousands distribution and underwriting fees distribution expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions net distribution fees net distribution fee margin net distribution fee margin varies by share class because each share class has different distribution and underwriting activities  which are described below 
class a shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares provide for a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
the sales charge is equal to a maximum of of the amount invested 
we retain an underwriting fee representing a portion of this sales charge and pay any remaining amounts to the selling firm 
we retained underwriting fees of million for the year ended december  we receive rule b distribution and service fees on class a shares at a rate of of class a share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these 
table of contents fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class a share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class a share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the distribution fee margin that we earn on class a shares is largely driven by the distribution fees that we earn as broker of record and by the portion of front end sales charges that we retain  which fluctuate with both the total class a share sales and the mix of class a share sales with and without a sales charge 
the percentage of class a share sales made without a sales charge has been increasing 
if this trend continues  we expect that our class a share net distribution fee margin will decrease 
class b shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  during the second quarter of we discontinued the sale of class b open end mutual funds 
prior to us closing this share class to new sales  investors in class b shares did not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we paid an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment was made 
this advanced payment was capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over eight years unless a redemption occurs 
upon redemption  we write off the remaining asset by increasing amortization expense 
if the investor redeems shares within the first six years of investment  we receive a contingent deferred sales charge of between during the first year declining to during the sixth year based upon the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class b share contingent deferred sales charge payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class b shares at the rate of of class b share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make rule b service fee payments to the selling firm at a rate of of class b share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
we retain a distribution fee to help us recover the upfront commissions that we paid to the selling firm 
rule b payments continue for eight years  at which point class b shares automatically convert into class a shares 
for the year ended december   we received class b share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class b share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the net distribution fee margin that we earn on class b shares is primarily the result of the difference between the annual distribution fee revenue that we receive on the average class b share assets under management and the amortization of the upfront commission over the life of the asset 
this differential creates a component of net distribution fee margin unique to class b shares that will remain constant before giving consideration to redemption activity or market appreciation or depreciation 
further  the net distribution fee margin on class b shares fluctuates due to the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets 
class c shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class c shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment is capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
for the year ended december   we made commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems class c shares within one year of investment  we receive from the proceeds of the sale a contingent deferred sales charge payment equal to of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class c share contingent deferred sales charge payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class c shares at the rate of of class c share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class c share rule b distribution and service fee payments to the selling firm beginning in the second year following the sale at the rate of of class c share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december  we received class c share b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class c share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the first year s rule b fees help us to recoup the upfront commission we paid to the selling firm  resulting in a net distribution fee margin on class c shares that is generally zero  before giving consideration to market 
table of contents appreciation or depreciation 
however  during the first months following the sale of class c shares  this margin will fluctuate due to the appreciation or depreciation of class c share assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class c share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate and as the percentage of assets older than months grows 
class i shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
class r shares are available for purchase through certain tax exempt retirement plans held in plan level or omnibus accounts and represented million of our assets under management as of december  investors in class r shares do not pay a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
we receive rule b fees on class r shares at a rate of of class r share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   the class r share b fees that we received and the class r share rule b payments that we made to selling firms were insignificant 
offshore funds represented million of our assets under management as of december  offshore funds do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees 
offshore funds are generally offered to individual and institutional investors that are domiciled or that have citizenship outside the us these funds are comprised of various share classes with distribution fees that differ from the investment company share classes described above 
distribution fees received from the offshore funds vary by share class and may be negotiated with distribution partners 
these fees received from the offshore funds are recorded as distribution and underwriting fee revenue while the payments made to third party selling firms recorded as distribution expenses 
for the year ended december   the offshore fund distribution fees received and paid were immaterial 
the net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of sales and assets by share class affects the overall net distribution fee margin 
for  the class b share margin is significantly greater than the class a  class c and class r shares due to the reduction in amortization expense associated with the change in the estimated remaining lives of the class b deferred sales commissions 
the reduction in amortization contributed to the increased net distribution margin year over year 
we expect this increase to be temporary as the age of the assets under management increases and as the class c shares  with lower margins  continue to represent a larger percentage of our asset base 
non operating income loss non operating income loss primarily represents net investment gains or losses from a portion of our investment portfolio and from the limited partnerships that we consolidate  net of non controlling interest in those partnerships 
capital gain distributions  dividends and net interest income or expense are also reported as components of non operating income loss 
non controlling interest non controlling interest in calamos holdings llc as sole manager of calamos holdings llc  we consolidate the financial results of calamos holdings llc with our own results 
outstanding shares of our class a common stock represent  and of the ownership of calamos holdings llc for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we reflect calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s collective ownership of  and in calamos holdings llc as of december   and  respectively  as a non controlling interest in our consolidated statements of financial condition  operations and changes in stockholders equity 
non controlling interest in calamos holdings llc is derived by multiplying the historical equity of calamos holdings llc by calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s collective ownership percentage for the periods presented 
issuances and repurchases of our class a common stock may result in changes to calamos asset 
table of contents management  inc s ownership percentage and to the non controlling interests ownership percentage of calamos holdings llc 
the corresponding changes in ownership are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity 
income is allocated to non controlling interests based on the average ownership interest during the period in which the income is earned 
as a result  our income loss before income tax provision benefit  excluding calamos family partners  inc and john p 
calamos  sr 
s non controlling interest  represent  and of calamos holdings llc s net income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income loss before income tax provision benefit includes investment and dividend income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments held solely by calamos asset management  inc during the same period 
this investment income is not reduced by any non controlling interest  therefore  the resulting non controlling interest as presented in the statement of operations differs slightly than their corresponding ownership percentage 
non controlling interest in partnership investments and offshore funds calamos partners llc is the general partner of calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp  a private investment partnership comprised of exchange traded investment securities 
at december   we and our affiliates had and interests in calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp combined 
at december   we and our affiliates had and interests in calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp combined 
calamos partners llc was also the general partner of calamos equity opportunities fund lp  a private investment partnership  until the partnership was liquidated during the second quarter of we consolidated the financial results of these partnerships into our results 
the combined interests of the investments in these partnerships not owned by us are presented as non controlling interest in partnership investments in our consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we established calamos global funds plc  which is comprised of four ireland based offshore mutual funds 
until december  we owned a majority of the offshore funds and consolidated its results into ours 
however  we no longer own a majority of the offshore funds  and therefore  we no longer consolidate the financial results of the offshore funds into our results 
as we launch new products  we and our affiliates may invest in these entities  which may require the consolidation of these entities into our results as well 
we expect the consolidation of these new entities to be temporary until new customers invest in the products and our resulting ownership percentage decreases 
income taxes for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
the tax rate does not give effect to the one time charge to income resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset to reflect the decrease in our illinois statutory tax rate 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  assets under management assets under management increased by billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  average assets under management increased by billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  at

the increase in security valuations positively impacted our mutual fund assets under management by billion during and by billion during net sales in our mutual funds were basically flat in and represent an unfavorable change of million from net purchases of million in the decrease in net sales is almost entirely attributable to the slowing of net sales into our convertible fund during the year which remained positive but decreased by billion 
we attracted net sales from investors into of our open end mutual funds during  including each of our offshore funds 
inflows were strongest in our alternative  convertible and fixed income strategies  as well as our global strategies which recorded year over year increases in net sales of nearly million 
however  these inflows were not sufficient to overcome the net outflows sustained from our growth fund  which in light of its strong investment performance we believe is a reflection of investors negative sentiment toward domestic equity strategies throughout most of separate accounts  which represent managed accounts for both institutions and individuals  had combined net redemptions of billion during  compared to net redemptions of million during the prior year 
the net outflows from our managed accounts in were primarily due to billion in net redemptions as a result of our decision in the first quarter of to increase the account minimums for our convertible based strategies on separately managed account platforms 
this effort was completed in the second quarter of  and we expect no further redemptions as a result of this strategic initiative 
the managed account outflows were partially offset by net inflows of million within our institutional accounts during which increased by million when 
table of contents compared to million of outflows in the prior year 
institutional accounts generally have long and varying lead times before funding occurs which creates fluctuations in sales volumes and limits predictability of sales volumes 
separate accounts were favorably impacted by market appreciation of billion during  compared to market appreciation of billion during financial review revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues investment management fees for the year ended december  increased as our average assets under management across all products increased by billion  or  during the year 
investment management fees from open end funds increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  driven by a increase in open end fund average assets under management 
investment management fees from our closed end funds increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period  due to a increase in closed end fund average assets under management 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts increased by to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  in line with the changes in average assets for these accounts 
the investment management fee rate that we earned for the year ended december  was and relatively constant when compared to the rate of 
despite the fact that our average open end mutual fund assets increased by when compared to the prior year  our distribution and underwriting fees increased by only  or million to million for the year ended december  the improvement in fees is mostly attributed to a million increase in asset based distribution fees 
however  that rate of growth in fees is limited by the composition of the mutual fund assets by share class 
as more mutual fund investors have chosen to compensate their financial advisors through fee based models  we have seen an increase demand for and a shift in assets toward our class i shares 
because we do not collect distribution fees from class i shares  our distribution revenue has decreased with this shift in assets 
this shift in assets has had no adverse effect to the operating results of the company because our distribution expenses have decreased proportionately with the decrease in revenues 
when compared to the prior year  the increase in distribution and underwriting fees was further limited by a billion decrease in redemption based fees  or contingent deferred sales charges 
the fee rate that we earn on class b share redemptions decreases as the average age of the class b share increases and expires after years 
because we have closed class b shares to new purchases  the average age of the class b shares will continue to increase over time and will result in a decrease in the contingent deferred sales charge rate that we receive 
other revenue principally reflects asset based portfolio accounting fees  which increased by nearly to million from the prior year 
these fees will generally rise and fall with the changes in average mutual fund assets that we manage 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses rose by to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change reflects increases in employee compensation and benefits expenses  distribution expenses and marketing and sales promotion expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution expenses amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  when compared to the largest component of this change is attributable to an increase in annual performance related incentive compensation accruals  as well as sales based incentive compensation payments 
though we have not meaningfully increased the number of associates that we employ  we have reduced staffing levels of our middle and back office operations teams and have increased staffing levels within our sales and marketing teams to focus on expanding our distribution and marketing capabilities 
these sales oriented individuals are generally more highly compensated  leading to increases in salary expenses and sales based incentive compensation 
distribution expenses generally represent a pass through to financial intermediaries of rule b distribution and service fees that we earn from the family of funds that we manage and distribute 
these expenses are directly related to changes in average open end fund assets under management of class a  b and c shares and to the proportion of class c share assets less than one year old 
for the year ended december   distribution expenses increased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this change is due to an increase in the average assets under management of class a and class c shares and an increase in the average class c shares assets older than one year 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we experienced a material shift of average mutual fund assets to class i shares  which do not include a distribution expense 
as a result of this increase in class i share mutual fund assets  distribution expenses did not grow at a rate commensurate with our average mutual fund assets under management 
amortization of deferred sales commissions typically change with the level of new mutual fund sales of class b and c share and with class b share redemptions 
during the second quarter of  we discontinued the sales of class b mutual fund shares  and as a result  the deferred sales commission assets are no longer replenished by new sales 
in connection with this discontinuation of class b shares sales  we adjusted the estimated lives of these assets  thus extending the period over which the remaining amortization expense will be recorded and reducing the periodic amortization expense recognized prospectively 
we expect that amortization expense associated with class b share deferred sales commissions will continue to decrease as the remaining class b share assets convert to class a shares over time 
the increase in marketing and sales promotion of million for the year ended december   is largely the result of supplemental distribution payments to brokers  which are directly related to the changes in average assets under management of our open end mutual funds 
throughout  we increased spending to support a series of targeted marketing and advertising campaigns to build awareness about our investment strategies 
we also enhanced our focus on e business  magnifying our digital presence to support our sales and client service efforts 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased by million 
many offsetting factors gave rise to the net increase in expense during as expected  professional service fees continued their upward trend in support of our initiative to outsource our middle and back office operations 
table of contents functions 
this outsourcing initiative also required us to make a million non recurring  license termination expense 
we expect this trend to continue until this outsourcing initiative is completed 
additionally  in support of expanding our international distribution efforts  travel related expenses have modestly increased during as compared to the impact of these items has been tempered by a reduction in depreciation expenses of more than million as certain equipment placed in service to accommodate our move into our headquarters has been fully depreciated

mutual fund net purchases were billion in  a favorable change of billion from billion of net redemptions in market appreciation was billion in compared to billion in depreciation for reflecting the positive changes in market conditions in versus our open end funds had billion of net purchases during in the fourth quarter of  we re opened our convertible fund for the first time since immediately following the re opening  the convertible fund started generating significant net purchases and continued to generate net purchases throughout additionally  we generated net purchases in of our mutual funds during the largest contributors to the increase were the convertible  total return bond  market neutral and high yield funds  as investors continued to gravitate towards lower risk and fixed income investment strategies 
market appreciation of billion was the main driver of asset growth in  while market depreciation of billion drove assets down in separate accounts  which represent managed accounts for both institutions and individuals  had net redemptions of million in  a slight improvement when compared to million in net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions during were primarily due to a reduction in investor s appetite to assume risk  leading to a shift away from equity strategies 
in addition  convertible strategies remained closed to new investors through our managed accounts 
market appreciation of billion in contributed to the growth 
table of contents in assets under management for the period while market depreciation of billion in added to the net redemptions 
one time items results of operations for were impacted by a significant one time expense 
developments in the illinois tax statutes resulted in modifications to the company s state tax apportionment methodology that lowered the company s statutory income tax rate from percent to percent 
while we view this to be beneficial for the long term by reducing income taxes  we recorded a one time  non cash income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  in the second quarter of to revalue our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new statutory income tax rate 
we consider results adjusted for this one time expense  as presented below  to provide a better indication of our operations 
this adjusted item is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
in evaluating operating performance  we consider operating expenses  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  and each item on an as adjusted basis  which constitute non gaap financial measures 
items presented on an as adjusted basis exclude the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of as this one time item is not expected to recur  we believe that excluding this item better enables us to evaluate our operating performance relative to the prior periods 
we consider these non gaap financial measures when evaluating our performance and believe the presentation of these amounts provides the reader with information necessary to analyze our operations for the periods compared 
reconciliations of these measurements from the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the twelve months ended december  is provided in the table below and should be carefully evaluated by the reader in thousands net loss net deferred tax assets revaluation net loss  as adjusted diluted loss per share net deferred tax assets revaluation diluted loss per share  as adjusted financial review revenues total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues compared to the prior year  investment management fees decreased in primarily due to a billion  or  decrease in average assets under management across all products 
investment management fees from open end funds decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to decreases in open end fund average assets under management of billion  or  for compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our institutional and managed 
table of contents accounts decreased to million from million primarily due to an approximate billion decrease in average assets under management 
investment management fees from our closed end funds decreased to million for from million for as a result of a billion decrease in closed end fund average assets under management 
investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of average assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
distribution and underwriting fees decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in distribution fees resulting from a decrease in open end fund average assets under management and a million decrease in contingent deferred sales charge fees  which change with the levels of class b and class c share redemptions 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million  or  for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change was primarily due to reduced employee compensation and benefits  distribution expense  and reduced amortization of deferred sales commission 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses as part of the company wide cost containment efforts that began in  employee compensation and benefits expense decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the full year impact of the reduction in staffing levels that occurred throughout and early salary  severance pay and related benefit expenses decreased by million from to  which was partially offset by a million increase in performance related incentive compensation  which remain significantly below potential payout levels 
distribution expense decreased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease of million in rule b expenses resulting from lower average open end funds under management of billion  or 
also contributing to the lower expenses was a reduction in average class c share assets older than one year 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pass along the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end fund assets under management and with the age of the class c share assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the prior year period resulting from the company s decision in the second quarter of to discontinue the sale of class b mutual funds 
as a result of our decision to discontinue class b share sales  the deferred sales commission assets will cease to be replenished by new sales and  therefore  we evaluated the estimated useful lives of the remaining assets 
based on this analysis  we extended the lives  or period over which we will amortize the remaining expense  effectively reducing the expense recorded in each period 
the impact of this change reduced the amortization of deferred sales commissions by approximately million on a quarterly basis 
marketing and sales promotion expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease of million in supplemental 
table of contents distribution payments to intermediaries 
these fees are mostly calculated based on assets under management and the decrease correlates with the lower average assets under management for when compared to general and administrative expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
the overall decline in these expenses reflects our continued focus on expense control initiated in and mostly represents reduced expenses for occupancy  professional services  and travel and entertainment 
the impact of our move towards a variable cost structure  specifically the outsourcing of the middle and back office functions  will be more fully realized in future periods 
we expect that these increases in general and administrative expenses will be generally reflected as reductions in employee compensation and benefits expenses

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
the net cash used in investing activities during was primarily comprised of additional investments in company sponsored mutual funds of million to help expand our product offering coupled with our net purchases of derivatives of million 
the increase in purchases and sales of investment securities is directly related to the execution of our tax harvesting strategy  whereby we sell and repurchase the identical investment securities to realize capital gains 
these capital gains offset our capital loss carryforward  and utilize a portion of our related deferred tax assets  which together were created in the fourth quarter of when we realized capital losses upon the sale of investment securities

distributions from calamos holdings llc to calamos asset management  inc are eliminated upon consolidation and are not reflected in the net cash flows used in financing activities 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities principally reflects increases in tax distribution driven by growing net income attributable to our non controlling interests  special pro rata equity distributions of approximately million  and an increase in our regular quarterly dividend from cents per share throughout to cents per share during net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   largely due to equity and tax distributions to non controlling interest owners  as well as dividends paid to common shareholders

these obligations are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of the company 
purchase obligations include executory contracts  which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty 
at december   the company s obligations primarily include standard service contracts for portfolio  market data and office related services 
purchase obligations are recorded in the company s financial statements when services are provided 
due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid  the amounts have been excluded from the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commissions deferred sales commissions represent amounts advanced by us to the selling firm upon sale of class b and class c shares of open end funds 
deferred sales commissions are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which b fees are received 
annually  we estimate the average remaining life of the class b share deferred sales commissions to determine the period over which to amortize the remaining class b share assets on a straight line basis 
because b fees cease upon redemption of shares  amortization expense is accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in the reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
these redemptions result in an amortization period not to exceed months for class c shares and months eight years for class b shares 

table of contents we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commissions for impairment on an annual basis 
significant assumptions utilized by us to estimate future average assets under management include expected future market performance and redemption rates 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
market performance assumptions are selected using expected average market returns based on long term market index benchmarks for each asset class held within the fund 
as of our most recent analysis  we used average market return assumptions ranging from to based on asset class 
if the average market returns are higher than estimated  undiscounted cash flows would be greater than those estimated  while lower actual returns on average would generate undiscounted future cash flows less than those estimated 
future redemption assumptions were determined by using the average annual redemption rates that each fund experienced over the prior month period 
for class b shares and class c shares  we used average historical redemption rates of and  respectively 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease the undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually  or when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
if we determine that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
as of each reporting period presented  we determined that no impairment of the deferred commission asset existed  but due to the volatility of the capital markets and the changes in redemption rates  we are unable to predict whether or when future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
compensation plans we have an incentive compensation plan that provides for grants of restricted stock unit awards  or rsus  and stock option awards for certain employees 
rsus are convertible on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the cost of stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the award 
further  we estimate the number of forfeited awards at the grant date 
actual forfeitures may vary from our assumptions  which will result in modifications to future expenses 
income tax provision benefit management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which principally related to our step up in tax basis to fair market value for our intangible assets under our election to be made under section of the internal revenue code and to our net capital loss carryforward 
in the event that sufficient taxable income of the same character does not result in future years  among other things  a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required 
because the determination of our annual income tax provision benefit is subject to judgments and estimates  it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements 
hence  we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all newly issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business and to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  including those not yet required to be adopted 
we do not believe any such pronouncements will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
all relevant accounting standards updates have been adopted and are reflected in the financial statements contained herein

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk securities price sensitivity our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisors for the mutual funds and separate accounts we manage 
a significant majority of our operating revenue is derived from investment advisory  
table of contents distribution and portfolio accounting agreements with the mutual funds and separate accounts 
under these agreements  the fees we receive are typically based on the market value of the assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease or by causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
in addition  a decline in the prices of securities may present market conditions that could preclude us from increasing assets under management and prevent us from realizing higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
we are also subject to market risk  in the form of equity price risk  due to a decline in the prices of our investments in certain investment securities  partnership investments and derivatives 
we own investment securities primarily comprised of products we manage

these major equity market index exchange traded put and call option contracts are used specifically for hedging the equity price risk of our portfolio 
the derivative assets and liabilities seen on our consolidated statements of financial condition are part of a single strategy to minimize the downside risk in the hedged portfolio  while allowing participation in a portion of an appreciating market 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at december  we had index exchange traded put and call option contracts with aggregate market values of million and million  respectively 
a adverse change in the option prices would result in a decrease of approximately million in our put option contracts and an increase in our call option liabilities of approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity at december   we had an aggregate of million of outstanding debt  including both current and long term portions  which consisted of senior unsecured notes of million of notes due april   million of notes due july   million of notes due july  and million of notes due july  as these notes have fixed interest rates  we do not believe that they have any interest rate risk 
other market risks due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material credit risk  inflation  interest rate or foreign currency rate risk
