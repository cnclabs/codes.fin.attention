significant accounting policies and management judgments the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements as of november   which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
periodically  the company reviews its estimates and judgments including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  litigation  environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales must meet the following criteria in order to be recognized as revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product must be shipped to the customer  whereby shipment results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  an established sales price has been set with the customer  collection of the sale revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
the company estimates and records provisions for quantity rebates  sales returns and allowances in the period the revenue is recognized  based upon its experience 
these items are included as a reduction in net sales 

table of contents b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all customers that are considered doubtful of collection based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors and to reserve the portion of such accounts receivable for which collection does not appear likely 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately and million at november  and  respectively 
c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence  which applies primarily to our decorative products segment  was approximately million at both november  and d litigation and environmental reserves from time to time  the company is subject to claims  lawsuits and proceedings related to product liability  product warranty  contract  employment  environmental and other matters 
the company provides a reserve for such matters when it concludes a loss is probable and the amount can be estimated 
costs related to environmental compliance are also accrued when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated 
e pensions and other post retirement plans the company accounts for its pension and other post retirement plans by recognizing in its balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the company recognizes the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive loss 
effective november   the company adopted measurement date provisions which require that plan assets and obligation be measured as of the balance sheet date 
prior to  the company measured plan assets and obligations at august the most significant elements in determining the company s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining service life of employees remaining in the plan 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the company recorded pension expense of million in and million in included in is a non cash curtailment expense of million 
pension expense is calculated using the discount rate  as determined below  to discount plan liabilities at the prior year measurement date 
the rates of and were used to calculate the pension expense in and  respectively 
the company anticipates non cash expense to be approximately million using a discount rate of 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
cash contributions to the pension plan were million in and no contributions were made in the company determined the discount rate used to discount the plan liabilities at the plan s measurement date  which was november  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively 
table of contents settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized investment ratings agency 
changes in discount rates  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company determined the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations as of november  should be compared to in to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the pension portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of a long term rate of return on assets assumption of for plan years and the measurement dates of november  and were used to determine these rates 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease the assets by approximately million and would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million 
pension plan assets are measured at fair value on the measurement date 
based on current estimates of pension asset performance  interest rate discount rate assumptions and credit balance  the company anticipates it will be required under the pension protection act of ppa  to make a cash contribution to its pension plan of approximately million in the company  under rules of the ppa  has elected the fifteen year amortization schedule for the period beginning with the plan year 
factors that could alter future cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are investment returns which differ materially from the company s return assumption 
significant changes in interest rates  affecting the discount rate 
opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum required schedule 
voluntary contributions in excess of minimally required amounts may prevent the need for larger contributions in the future 
f income taxes the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of november   the company had approximately million of net federal  state and local deferred tax assets primarily related to federal domestic loss carryforwards  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment losses  changes in pension liabilities  and other temporary differences for which a domestic valuation allowance of million has been provided 
in addition  as of november  the company had million of net deferred tax liabilities related to the decorative products asian businesses 
the company  after considering the guidance in asc  income taxes  reversed a significant portion of its valuation reserve for the us deferred tax asset 
this resulted in a tax benefit of million 
for the year ended november   the company again considered the positive and negative evidence as required by asc and concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit from the us deferred tax assets due to a preponderance of positive evidence  which includes a three year us cumulative income position  increased predictability over future taxable income and future taxable income from the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities in future years 
this may result in the company recognizing higher income tax expense going forward 
however  because of nolc s  the company does not expect to incur significant cash payments for us taxes over the next several years 
the company has not provided us income taxes on certain of its non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as such amounts are permanently reinvested outside the us to the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as permanently 
table of contents reinvested are repatriated  the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 
however  based on the company s policy of permanent reinvestment  it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
as of november   the non us subsidiaries have a cumulative unremitted foreign loss position of million for which us income taxes have not been provided 
the company utilizes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s accounting policy for interest and or penalties related to underpayments of income taxes is to include interest and penalties in tax expenses 
accrued interest and penalties were million as of november  g share based employee compensation the company uses the fair value method of recording share based payments  based on the grant date fair value 
while the company regularly evaluates the use of share based payments  its practice has been to issue fewer stock options than have been issued in the past  utilizing other forms of incentives such as restricted stock  which are required to be expensed using the fair value method 
see note n to the company s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of share based payments 
h long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
environmental matters the company s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment 
the company devotes significant resources and management attention to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of november  reflects reserves for environmental remediation efforts of million 
capital expenditures for projects related to environmental matters were million in  million in and million in during  non capital expenditures for environmental compliance and protection totaled million  all of which were for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution abatement in ongoing operations 
similar non capital expenditures were million and million in years and  respectively
