item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
liquidity risk our investments in privately placed fixed maturities  mortgage loans  policy loans and limited partnership interests  which collectively represented approximately of total invested assets as of december   are relatively illiquid compared to publicly traded fixed maturities and equities 
in addition  periods of market disruption  such as those experienced in the past three years  could also reduce liquidity for securities generally considered to be readily marketable 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
this risk is mitigated by the liquidity structure of our underlying reserves  of which are considered illiquid or somewhat illiquid 
for further information on the liquidity of our underlying reserves  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
defaults in our commercial mortgage loans may adversely affect our profitability 
our mortgage loans  which are collateralized by commercial properties  are subject to default risk 
during  we began strategically increasing our mortgage loan portfolio and originated million of new loans  compared to million originated in we carry our mortgage loans at outstanding principal balances  adjusted for unamortized deferred fees and costs  net of an allowance for loan losses 
our allowance includes a reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the portfolio  and specific reserves for any non performing loans 
the reserve for probable incurred losses is based on our historical experience  third party data for expected losses on loans with similar loan to value  and debt service coverage ratios 
specific reserves are determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
these reserves are estimates and may not be sufficient to cover actual losses 
as of december   no loans were classified as non performing 
however  due to the uncertain economic environment and the growth in our portfolio  the performance of our mortgage loan portfolio may decline in the future 
in addition  the majority of our loans have balloon payment maturities  which may trigger future defaults on currently performing loans 
an increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments  caused by current or worsening economic conditions or otherwise  could result in realized losses or increases in our allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  any geographic concentration of our commercial mortgage loans may expose us to higher risk of adverse effects on our loan portfolio and  consequently  on our results of operations or financial condition 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or economic sector may have a greater adverse effect on our loan portfolio 
as of december   of our commercial mortgage loans were located in california  were located in washington and were located in texas

gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may become realized or result in future impairments  resulting in a reduction in our net income 
fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at their estimated fair value and compose a significant portion of our total assets 
liquidity needs  portfolio rebalancing  or other reasons may require us to sell these securities prior to maturity  or credit concerns could prompt us to conclude that a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the resulting realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are recognized as a component of aoci and are therefore excluded from net income 
the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these available for sale securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge is taken 
our gross unrealized losses on available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities as of december  were million 
the portion of the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost or cost by or more for six months or greater was million as of december  our valuation of fixed maturity securities may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and represent approximately of our invested assets as of december  the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three level hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation models using unobservable inputs level 
level and level measurements compose a significant portion of our invested assets  as of december   approximately billion  or  of our fixed maturities were categorized as level measurements  and billion  or  were categorized as level because values for securities classified as level and level are not based on quoted market prices for identical instruments  the amount we realize upon settlement or maturity may differ significantly from our reported fair value 
additionally  multiple valuation methods may be applicable to a security  and the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value amounts 
decreases in valuations may result in unrealized losses recorded in stockholders equity or realized losses recorded in net income  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our level measurements are obtained from our pricing services and derived from models that use objectively verifiable  observable market inputs  such as benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and other reference data  including market research publications 
because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis  evaluated pricing models apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
if such information about a security is unavailable  we determine the fair value using internal pricing models that typically utilize significant  unobservable market inputs or inputs that are difficult to corroborate with observable market data 
as of december   million  or  of our fixed maturities portfolio was invested in private placement securities  which are not actively traded 
the fair values of million  or  of these assets are classified as level  as they are determined using a discounted cash flow approach that requires the use of inputs that are not market observable and involves significant judgment 

table of contents during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly rising interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities for example  corporate private placements if trading becomes less frequent and or market data becomes less observable 
there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment 
in such cases  valuations for those securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment  including valuation methods  inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation 
rapidly changing and adverse credit and equity market conditions could also materially impact the valuation of securities reported in our consolidated financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
to mitigate these risks  we use established  industry standard valuation models consistently from period to period 
for more information on our valuation methodology for invested assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our investment management objective is to support the expected cash flows of our liabilities and to produce stable returns over the long term  thus  we typically hold our fixed maturities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for the sale of such investments 
downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our profitability 
we recognize changes in fair value of our investments in certain common stock or other equity like securities in net income  through net realized investment gains losses 
these investments  which generally provide higher expected total returns over the long term  present a greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed maturity investments 
as of december   less than two percent of our invested assets were invested in securities whose changes in fair value are typically highly correlated with changes in the equity markets 
while these investments do not represent a significant portion of our invested assets  a decline in the equity markets could have a significant adverse effect on our net income  and also increase volatility in results between periods 
for example  for the year ended december   net losses on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  as the s p total return index declined that year 
in the following year ending december   net gains were million on the portfolio  as the s p total return index improved nearly 
for the year ended december   net gains on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  as the s p total return index rose approximately for the year 
we may face unanticipated losses if we determine our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate  or there are significant deviations from our pricing assumptions 
we calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future benefit payments to our policyholders and contract holders in accordance with us gaap  which are released as those future obligations are extinguished 
the reserves we establish are estimates  primarily based on actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience  which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
our future financial results depend upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves 
many factors can affect future experience  including economic  political and social conditions  mortality and morbidity  persistency  inflation  healthcare costs and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  we cannot predict the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual future benefits or the timing of those payments 
health care costs in particular have risen substantially in recent history and may continue to do so 
our medical stop loss products provide coverage for claims exceeding certain dollar thresholds for either individual or aggregate claims  and increased medical costs may result in higher claims 
while we monitor claims costs and changes that may affect future costs  such as medical inflation  changing demographics and changes in the mix of our business  increases in medical costs may exceed our expectations or may not be properly factored into our pricing 
this could adversely affect the results of operations in our group segment 

table of contents persistency is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next 
for most of our products  actual persistency that is lower than our assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability  especially in the early years of a policy or contract primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract 
in addition  we may need to sell investments at a loss to fund withdrawals 
for some of our life insurance policies  actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability 
if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed  then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products 
in addition  we set prices for our insurance and certain annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns  using assumptions for  among other factors  morbidity rates and mortality rates of our policyholders and contract holders 
the long term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions 
for example  if morbidity rates are higher or mortality rates are lower than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under certain annuity contracts than we had projected 
our largest exposure to morbidity risk is in our medical stop loss products  which we mitigate through reinsurance 
for example  our specific stop loss business is reinsured for claims above million 
our largest exposure to mortality risk is in our life segment  which we also mitigate through reinsurance 
additionally  a general increase in mortality would be favorable to our income annuities segment  as we may pay fewer benefits than expected 
we regularly monitor our reserves and review our assumptions 
if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments  we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges in the period in which we make that determination  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there were no significant adjustments to reserves due to inadequacy during or although certain of our products permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract  these changes may not be sufficient to maintain profitability  or may reduce the attractiveness of our products relative to competitors 
moreover  many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or may limit those changes during the life of the policy or contract 
therefore  significant deviations in experience from our assumptions regarding persistency  mortality and morbidity rates could have an adverse affect on our profitability 
we may face unanticipated losses if we are required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and or deferred sales inducements if there are significant deviations in actual experience or in anticipated assumptions 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent certain costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our products and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related contracts 
these costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions  certain sales incentives  and other costs such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses 
deferred sales inducements represent bonus interest and excess interest mainly on our fixed deferred annuity products  which are deferred and reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as interest credited over the estimated life of the related contracts 
under us gaap  dac and dsi are amortized through income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits for most of our products 
as of december   we had million of dac and million of dsi 
our amortization of dac and dsi generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  crediting rates  surrender and other policy and contract charges  mortality  morbidity and maintenance and 
table of contents expense margins 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  crediting rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of dac and dsi  resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability 
our assumptions  including those related to expenses  investment returns  credited interest rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapse experience among others  are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience to date 
for future assumptions  we conduct a study to refine our estimates of future gross profits on an annual basis during the third quarter 
upon completion of this study  we revise our assumptions and update our dac models to reflect our current best estimate 
changes in our actual experience or our expected future experience may result in increased amortization of dac or dsi  which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability 
we regularly review our dac and dsi asset balances to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
the portion of the dac and dsi asset balances deemed to be unrecoverable  if any  is charged to expense in the period in which we make this determination 
for example  if we determine that we are unable to recover dac or dsi from profits over the life of a book of business of insurance policies or annuity contracts  we would be required to recognize the unrecoverable dac or dsi amortization as a current period expense 
for further information on our dac accounting policy  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates deferred policy acquisition costs 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap  which is periodically revised by recognized authorities  including the financial accounting standards board fasb 
recently  the fasb issued revised guidance for dac  which limits the costs that are eligible for deferral 
this guidance is effective for our fiscal year and may result in more acquisition costs being expensed as incurred  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additionally  we may retrospectively adopt this guidance  which would decrease our historical dac asset and retained earnings balances presented in our future financial statements and decrease future dac amortization 
in addition  the fasb is developing new guidance for accounting for insurance contracts  which would measure liabilities for insurance contracts based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to fulfill the contract 
this could change the recognition and measurement of insurance obligations on our statement of financial position and impact the timing of the related income in our results of operations 
the fasb is also drafting new guidance for financial instruments which  as currently proposed  would change the way credit losses for financial assets are measured 
if adopted  these and other future accounting standards could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements  and such changes could have an adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
financial strength ratings  which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and our products  and the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
additionally  our structured settlement products are typically purchased during lawsuit settlements for the benefit of injured claimants and the purchase must be approved by the courts  which place significant reliance on financial strength ratings 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  or the announced potential for a downgrade  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in several ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  
table of contents limiting our ability to offer structured settlement products  increasing our cost of capital  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders  requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive  and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance 
we rely on reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks  and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate 
we utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances  primarily related to our individual life and group products 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
the total reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers was million as of december   of which million was recoverable from our single largest reinsurer 
our reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us now or in the future or on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reinsurance may not be available  affordable or adequate to protect us against losses 
as part of our overall risk management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments 
while reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing  market conditions beyond our control can determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business 
in certain circumstances  the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase 
any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will reduce our earnings 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue 
for further discussion on our reinsurance program  see item business reinsurance 
we may be unable to attract and retain independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists which could result in a reduction in sales or a loss of business 
we distribute our products through financial intermediaries  independent producers and dedicated sales specialists 
we compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels  and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay  the breadth of our product offerings  the design and positioning of our product offerings  
table of contents the adjustments we make in premium or interest crediting rates  the strength of our brand  our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings  the marketing and services we provide to them  and the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms 
through time our relationship with distributors may deteriorate due to any of the above factors  which could result in a drop in sales and or a loss of existing business due to higher surrender activity 
our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential distribution partners to favor their products or to reduce sales of our products 
our contracts with our distribution partners generally allow either party to terminate the relationship upon short notice 
our distribution partners do not make minimum purchase commitments  and our contracts do not prohibit our partners from offering products that compete with ours 
accordingly  our distribution partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all  or may choose to exert insufficient resources and attention to selling our products 
sales from our top five distribution partners accounted for approximately of our total sales in if our relationships with these distributors were to deteriorate  it is likely that we would experience a decline in our sales 
turbulent economic conditions may also impair our distribution partners  which would have an adverse impact on our sales 
further  consolidation of financial institutions could increase competition for access to distributors  result in greater distribution expenses  and impair our ability to market our products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base 
from time to time  due to competitive forces  we may also experience unusually high employee attrition in particular sales channels for specific products 
an inability to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists  or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our future success is highly dependent on maintaining and growing both existing and new distribution relationships 
we may have little or no contact or brand awareness with end customers of our products  which makes it more difficult to respond to evolving customer needs and increases our reliance on our distribution partners 
new executive leadership may not be able to successfully implement business strategies for growth 
our success depends upon our executive leadership team s ability to develop and implement a successful business strategy 
during  we announced a number of changes in our executive leadership team 
while the new members of our executive leadership team are experienced in the life insurance industry  they have not worked together in their new positions with the company and may not be able to successfully implement our new business strategies in the current economic environment 
failure to effectively integrate our new executive leadership team or failure of our new executive leadership team to implement our business strategies could materially adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operation 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 
our businesses are subject to intense competition 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features  price  commission structure  marketing and distribution arrangements  brand  reputation  financial strength ratings and service 
many other companies actively 
table of contents compete for sales of deferred and income annuity products  group health and life insurance  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and asset management firms and specialty providers 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from companies that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our product lines  which could make it difficult to achieve our target returns 
our strategies for mitigating risks arising from our day to day operations may prove ineffective resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 
our performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of our day to day business activities  including setting of premium or interest crediting rates  underwriting  claims processing  policy administration and servicing  execution of our investment strategy  financial and tax reporting  marketing and sales efforts  and other activities  many of which are complex 
we also may rely on third parties for such activities 
we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of or related to these activities through a variety of internal controls  management review processes  and other mechanisms 
however  the occurrence of unforeseen or un contemplated risks  or the occurrence of risks of a greater magnitude than expected  including those arising from a failure in processes  procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees or third parties upon which we rely in this regard  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the occurrence of natural disasters  disease pandemics  terrorism or military actions could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial condition and results of operations are at risk of material adverse effects that could arise from catastrophic mortality and morbidity due to natural disasters  including floods  tornadoes  earthquakes and hurricanes  disease pandemics  terrorism and military actions 
such events could also lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations  such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies or deposits into our investment products 
the effectiveness of external parties  including governmental and nongovernmental organizations  in combating the spread and severity of a disease pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  and a natural disaster or a disease pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster 
these could adversely impact the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio 
further  in our group health and life insurance operations  including bank owned life insurance  a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims 
the majority of our operations are located in bellevue  washington 
in the event of a catastrophic event or disaster in this area  our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time  which may interrupt our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and may result in limited or no connectivity 
the majority of our employees are equipped to work remotely  however certain duties  such as processing new business applications  may be difficult to perform remotely 

table of contents the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could adversely affect our business 
we use computer systems to store  retrieve  evaluate and use customer and company data and information 
additionally  our computer and information technology systems interface with and rely upon third party systems 
our business is highly dependent on our ability  and the ability of our affiliates  to access these systems to perform necessary business functions  including providing insurance quotes  processing premium payments  providing customer support  filing and paying claims and making changes to existing policies 
we also use systems for investment management  financial reporting and data analysis to support our policyholder reserves and other actuarial estimates 
our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserving decisions  inadequate information for accurate financial reporting  increases in administrative expenses  the loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  customer  provider and agent disputes  litigation exposure  or regulatory compliance problems  such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations 
systems outages or outright failures would compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner 
this could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and harm our ability to conduct business 
in the event of a disaster such as a blackout  a computer virus  an industrial accident  a natural catastrophe  a terrorist attack or war  our systems may not be available to our employees  customers or business partners for an extended period of time 
if our systems or our data are destroyed or disabled  employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time 
our systems could also be subject to similar disruptions due to physical and electronic break ins or other types of unauthorized tampering with our systems 
this may interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop  maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients is critical to the operation of our business  and failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients 
the failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business 
a number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations 
for example  the collection and use of patient data in our group segment is the subject of national and state 
table of contents legislation  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and certain of the activities conducted by our businesses are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act 
we also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients 
these obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information 
the actions we take to protect confidential information vary by business segment and may include  among other things training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information  actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements  drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues  maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records  limiting access to electronic information  and in the event of a security breach  providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers 
in addition  we must develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information 
if we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information  we could experience adverse consequences  including regulatory sanctions  such as penalties  fines and loss of license  as well as loss of reputation and possible litigation 
this could have an adverse impact on our company s image and  therefore  result in lower sales or lapses of existing business 
our business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships 
we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties  including a significant portion of our investment management and information technology functions  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
when we engage a third party vendor  we perform extensive due diligence on the vendor  including evaluations of quality of service  financial stability  compliance with laws and regulations and appropriate business continuity plans 
however  if we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third party providers do not perform as contracted  we may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
our credit facility subjects us to operating and financial covenants on our operations and could limit our ability to grow our business 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility on august  we rely on the facility as a potential source of liquidity  which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due  particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited 
as of december   we had no balance outstanding and we have had no borrowings under this facility since it was established 
in connection with this facility  we have agreed to covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness by our subsidiaries  limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to create liens and impose certain other operating limitations 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing or take advantage of business opportunities 

table of contents furthermore  our credit facility requires us and our insurance subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratios in our credit facility  we may be deemed in default under the facility and unable to access it when needed  or we may be required to pay substantial fees or penalties to the lenders to obtain a waiver of any such default 
either development could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
raising additional capital could dilute stockholder ownership in the company and may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we need liquidity to pay our policyholder benefits  operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock  and to pay down or replace certain debt obligations as they mature 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund liquidity needs  refinance our senior notes or our capital efficient notes cents  satisfy letter of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators  acquire new businesses or invest in existing businesses  grow our business  otherwise respond to competitive pressures  maintain adequate risk based capital  or maintain our target ratings from rating agencies 
future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long term debt market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  which may require us to reduce or eliminate future stockholder dividends of our common stock  utilize unused borrowings for general corporate purposes  undertake additional capital management activities  including reinsurance transactions  limit or curtail sales of certain products and or restructure existing products  undertake asset sales or internal asset transfers  and seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules 
certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and or the approval of counterparties  which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them 
actions we might take to access financing may also cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
further  in connection with the cents 
table of contents offering  we entered into a covenant that may limit our ability to undertake certain additional types of financing to repay or redeem the cents 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity will dilute each stockholder s ownership percentage in our company and may decrease the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  newly issued securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock 
any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient liquidity  we could be forced to curtail our operations  and our business could suffer 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business and maintain desired financial ratios 
these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow our business  replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets in a timely manner 
as a result  we may be forced to delay raising capital  bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price  which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
as a holding company  symetra financial corporation depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations and pay dividends 
symetra is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries with no significant operations of its own 
its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay dividends consist of dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments under tax sharing agreements with its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
based on our statutory results as of december   our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends to us of up to million in the aggregate during without obtaining regulatory approval 
competitive pressures generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings  which are partly based on maintaining certain levels of capital 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements  such as minimum required risk based capital ratios  affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service our debt 
there are a number of other factors that could affect our ability to pay dividends  including the following lack of available cash due to changes in our operating cash flow  capital expenditure requirements  working capital requirements and other cash needs  unexpected or increased operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof  restrictions under delaware law or other applicable law on the amount of dividends that we may pay  a decision by our board of directors to modify or revoke its policy to pay dividends  and the other risks described in this section

and berkshire hathaway inc  each beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march  including warrants exercisable for  shares held by affiliates of each of white mountains insurance group  ltd

accordingly  they may have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the nomination and election of 
table of contents directors and the determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including amendments to our certificate of incorporation  potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of our principal stockholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
risks related to our industry our industry is highly regulated and changes in regulations affecting our businesses may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
our insurance businesses are heavily regulated and are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws and regulated by the insurance departments of the various states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
state laws in the united states grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to various aspects of our insurance businesses  including licensing companies and agents to transact business  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating certain premium rates  reviewing and approving policy forms  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  including the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices  distribution arrangements and payment of inducements  establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards  establishing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts  requiring regular market conduct examinations  approving changes in control of insurance companies  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates  and regulating the types  amounts and valuation of investments 
state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products 
changes in these laws and regulations  or in interpretations thereof  are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business 
currently  the us federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance 
however  the dodd frank act created a federal insurance office 
while the office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business  it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  the results of these studies or other such proposals  if enacted  may have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  federal legislation and administrative policies in other areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance 
table of contents companies  including general financial services regulation  securities regulation  pension regulation  privacy regulation  tort reform legislation  and taxation 
many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business 
us federal and state securities laws apply to investment products that are also securities  including variable annuities and variable life insurance policies 
as a result  some of our subsidiaries and the policies and contracts they offer are subject to regulation under these federal and state securities laws 
some of our insurance subsidiaries separate accounts are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of some subsidiaries are registered as broker dealers under the securities exchange act of and are members of  and subject to regulation by finra 
in addition  one of our subsidiaries also is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of these subsidiaries may also be impacted by interpretations and rules created as a result of the dodd frank act 
securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients 
these laws and regulations grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with those laws and regulations 
legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation 
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
in our insurance operations  we may become subject to class actions and regulatory actions and we are or may become subject to individual lawsuits relating  among other things  to sales or underwriting practices  payment of contingent or other sales commissions  claims payments and procedures  product design  disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  interest crediting practices  denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
for example  the insurance industry has been the focus of increased scrutiny and lawsuits related to retained asset accounts offered to beneficiaries  which offer access to benefits through drafts on interest bearing accounts held by the insurer in lieu of a lump sum payout 
the lawsuits allege that customers were misled about access to and security of these funds  and that insurers unjustly profited through low crediting rates offered on the accounts 
the outcome of these lawsuits is unknown 
as of december   balances held in our retained asset accounts were million  and we have not been the subject of any inquiries or lawsuits regarding these practices 
in addition  annuity sales to seniors are coming under increased scrutiny by finra and state insurance regulators  and have been the source of industry litigation in situations where annuity sales have allegedly been unsuitable for the seniors financial needs 
we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas  market conduct exams and books and record examinations  from state and federal regulators and other authorities  which may result in fines  recommendations for corrective action or other regulatory actions 

table of contents current or future investigations and proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business 
moreover  even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation  regulatory action or investigation  we could suffer significant reputational harm  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business 
the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products that we sell 
on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  which brings substantial change to the insurance coverage for medical costs 
ppaca directly or indirectly impacts our group medical stop loss and limited benefit medical businesses 
ppaca mandated studies that are expected to be released late in the first quarter could influence future legislation affecting self insured health plans and  thus  our medical stop loss business 
although our limited benefit medical product is exempt from many of the reforms mandated by ppaca due to its fixed indemnity design  it does not provide minimum essential coverage as defined under ppaca provisions effective in we will continue to monitor the implementation of ppaca and reassess our business strategies accordingly 
potential changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our results of operations 
many of the products that we sell benefit from one or more forms of tax favored status under current federal tax law 
for example  we sell life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy  as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries 
we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract 
congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers  including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of life insurance and annuity products 
due in large part to the recent budget crisis affecting many governments  there is an increasing risk that federal and or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and their policyholders 
although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain  it could include reducing or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us or our policyholders 
changes to these favorable tax statuses could adversely affect our sales and lapses of current policies 
in addition  changes in tax laws could increase our company tax liability and income tax expense 
for example  recent federal budget proposals  if enacted  would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products 
in particular  those proposals include modifying the dividends received deduction for life insurance company separate accounts and expanding the interest expense disallowance for corporate owned life insurance 
if proposals of this type were enacted  our sales could be adversely affected  primarily variable products and boli  and our actual tax expense could increase  reducing earnings 
failures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations 
when an insurance company becomes insolvent  state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company  up to the state specific limit of coverage 
the total amount of the assessment is based on the number of insured residents in each state  and each company s portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business 
the future failure of a large life  health or annuity insurer could trigger assessments which we would be obligated to pay 
further  amounts for historical insolvencies may be assessed over many years  and there can be significant uncertainty around the 
table of contents total obligation for a given insolvency 
existing liabilities may not be sufficient to fund the ultimate obligations of a historical insolvency  and we may be required to increase our liability  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

our headquarters in bellevue serves as the primary location for operations of all of our divisions 
in addition to our headquarters  we lease other properties throughout the us which comprise a total of  square feet 
we believe our properties are suitable and adequate for our business as presently conducted 
item legal proceedings we are regularly a party to litigation  arbitration proceedings and governmental examinations in the ordinary course of our business 
while we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation or examination  we do not believe that any pending matter  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business
