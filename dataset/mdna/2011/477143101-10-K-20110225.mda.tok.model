item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an award winning airline with a differentiated product and a commitment to customer service that offers competitive fares primarily on point to point routes 
our value proposition includes operating a young  fuel efficient fleet with more legroom than any other domestic airline s coach product  free in flight entertainment  pre assigned seating  unlimited snacks  and the airline industry s only customer bill of rights 
at december   we served destinations in states  puerto rico  and eleven countries in the caribbean and latin america and operated over flights a day with a fleet of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
in  we reported net income of million and an operating margin of  as compared to net income of million and an operating margin of in the year over year improvement in our financial performance was primarily a result of an increase in our average fares and increase in capacity  offset by a increase in our realized fuel price 
our goal is to become the americas favorite airline for our employees whom we refer to as crewmembers  customers and shareholders 
our achieving this goal is dependent upon continuing to provide superior customer service and delivering the jetblue experience 
our financial strategy currently includes a commitment to attaining positive free cash flow and long term sustainable growth while also maintaining an adequate liquidity position 
our commitment to these goals drives a focus on controlling costs  maximizing unit revenues  managing capital expenditures  and disciplined growth 
our disciplined growth begins with managing the growth  size and age of our fleet 
in  we continued to carefully manage the size of our fleet in order to support a sustainable growth rate 
as a result  aircraft capital expenditures were significantly reduced from previous years 
we modified our airbus a purchase agreement in february and october resulting in the deferral of aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in through to and we also modified our embraer purchase agreement in august  canceling two embraer aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in with new opportunities  including the coveted slots at washington s reagan national we acquired via a slot swap during and further growth opportunities particularly in boston and the caribbean  we leased six used airbus a aircraft under individual six year operating leases  which were in addition to our purchase commitments with airbus 
during the year  in addition to the six leased as  we also increased the size of our embraer operating fleet by four aircraft 
we may further modify our fleet growth through additional aircraft sales  leasing of aircraft  returns of leased aircraft and or deferral of aircraft deliveries 
our disciplined growth also includes the optimization of our route network by focusing on key regions  including boston  new york  the caribbean and latin america  continuing our focus on attracting business customers while also building upon our leisure markets  strong visiting friends and relatives  or vfr  travel  and continued expansion of our portfolio of strategic commercial partnerships 
we added three new destinations in  compared to eight new destinations that were added in and two that were added in we commenced service to punta cana  dominican republic in may  ronald reagan national airport in washington  dc and hartford  ct in november we began service to providenciales  turks and caicos islands in february and have announced plans to commence service to anchorage  alaska and martha s vineyard  ma in may during  we strengthened our position as the largest carrier in boston by adding six new destinations from boston and we announced plans to increase our presence in san juan  puerto rico by adding new service and increased frequencies 
we also continue to build upon our presence in the caribbean and latin america where we have approximately of our capacity  and we expect this number to continue to grow in we believe that optimizing our schedule across our network has both increased our relevance to the business traveler  particularly in boston  as well as to the leisure and vfr travelers in the caribbean and latin america 
we expect that we will continue to diversify our network in order to further grow and strengthen our network 
in  we plan to continue our focus on boston and caribbean expansion 

table of contents during  we also focused on building our portfolio of strategic commercial partnerships with several international carriers 
we believe these agreements provide additional revenue opportunities for us and increased travel benefits and opportunities to our customers by allowing access to diverse international markets and a seamless check in process 
our current partnerships are structured with gateways at either jfk  boston or washington dc  allowing access for international travelers on many of our key domestic and caribbean routes 
our partners currently include deutsche lufthansa ag  one of the world s preeminent airlines and our largest shareholder  cape air  an airline that services destinations out of boston and san juan  puerto rico  aer lingus  an airline based in dublin  ireland  american airlines  south african airways  africa s most awarded airline  el al israel airlines  israel s national airline  and emirates  one of the world s largest international carriers 
in november  we launched an improved version of our customer loyalty program  trueblue 
the program was re designed based on customer feedback  and is aimed at making our frequent flyer benefits more robust  rewarding  and flexible 
trueblue points are earned based on the value paid for a flight as opposed to the length of travel 
under the enhanced program  there are no blackout dates for award flights and points expirations can be extended 
based on extensive customer surveys  we believe this enhanced program will make our product more appealing to the business customer 
in addition to our new trueblue loyalty program  our new integrated customer service system  which includes a reservations system  revenue management system and revenue accounting system  was implemented in january we believe transitioning to this new platform has enabled us to enhance our product and has positioned us well for our long term growth 
benefits from this new system include added flexibility in the complex environments in which we operate  increased participation in global distribution systems  or gds  which in turn contributes to higher yielding traffic  enhanced opportunities with respect to commercial partnerships  additional ancillary revenue opportunities  improved functionality of our website  and improved revenue management capabilities 
during  we also invested substantially in other it infrastructure improvements and upgrades 
in addition to the increased functionality  we believe these improvements have enabled us to better serve our customers and handle our day to day operations  whereas our previous infrastructure might not have been able to continue to sustain our operations  especially in times of severe irregular operations 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue accounted for of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  excluding puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare and  in certain markets  utilize our network to maximize connecting opportunities while continuing to provide our customers with competitive fares 
when we enter a new market our fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
passenger revenue also includes revenue from our even more legroom  or eml  ancillary product enhancement 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues  revenues associated with transporting mail and cargo  rental income and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems on other airlines 

table of contents we maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry relative to the product we offer due to the young average age of our fleet  a productive non union workforce  and cost discipline 
in  we plan to continue our focus on cost control while improving the jetblue experience for our customers 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and related taxes and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our crewmembers 
unlike most airlines  we have a policy of not furloughing crewmembers during economic downturns  and a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising  fees paid to credit card companies  and commissions paid for our participation in gdss and otas 
we believe our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because the majority of our customers book directly through our website 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft currently require less maintenance than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs  gains on aircraft sales and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes 
during fuel prices remained volatile  increasing over average prices 
we actively manage our fuel hedge portfolio by entering into a variety of fuel hedge contracts in order to provide some protection against volatility and further increases in fuel prices 
in total  we effectively hedged of our total fuel consumption 
as of december   we had outstanding fuel hedge contracts covering approximately of our forecasted consumption for the first quarter of  for the full year  and for the full year we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
the airline industry has been intensely competitive in recent years  due in part to persistently high fuel prices and the adverse financial condition of many of the domestic airlines  leading to significant consolidation  bankruptcies and liquidation 
in  industry consolidation activities continued and further impacted the competitive landscape  most notably with the merger of united airlines and continental airlines  which created the world s largest airline and became effective in october  on the heels of the delta air lines and northwest airlines merger in additionally  in september  low cost carrier southwest airlines announced plans to acquire airtran airways 
we continue to focus on maintaining an adequate liquidity level 
our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity  thereby managing our capital expenditures to accommodate a sustainable growth plan 
we have manageable scheduled debt maturities in totaling approximately million  which we believe will enable us to achieve our liquidity goals 
our ability to be profitable in this competitive environment depends on  among other things  continuing to provide high quality customer service  operating at costs equal to or lower than those of our competitors and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow in recent years  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry and the impact of economic conditions could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to be profitable in new and existing markets 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
our vfr markets continue to complement our leisure driven markets from both a seasonal and day of week perspective 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with de icing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced customers 

table of contents our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
as such  we are currently focused on trying to reduce the seasonal impact of our operations and increase demand and travel during the trough periods 
outlook for we anticipate that our continued focus in will be on our long term sustainable growth goals and positioning our airline for the future 
we intend to do so by actively managing capital expenditures  maintaining a rigorous focus on cost control and optimizing unit revenues while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain and volatile economic and industry environment 
we will continue to rationalize capacity to take advantage of market opportunities and seek to balance the peaks and trough periods of the travel markets 
in addition  we continuously look to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities and enhance the jetblue experience for all of our customers  leisure and business travelers alike 
for the full year  we expect our operating capacity to increase approximately to over with the net addition of four airbus a aircraft and four embraer aircraft to our operating fleet  most of which will be deployed in our boston and caribbean markets 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  including fuel taxes and net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over this expected increase is a result of higher maintenance costs due to the aging of our fleet  expected increase in fuel prices  and higher salaries and wages due to pay scale adjustments  additional headcount and higher cost of healthcare benefits 
results of operations during  overall economic conditions strengthened and the demand for domestic leisure and business air travel improved significantly from conditions 
improving yields and capacity reductions by our competitors have enhanced our ability to grow in regions and on routes where we see the most opportunity 
average fares for the year increased over to and load factor increased points to from the full year throughout  we made efforts to improve revenue performance during off peak travel periods by attracting new customers  continuing to refine our product and the jetblue experience  and offering fare sales and promotions when the markets allowed 
our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in our on time performance throughout the year and on a year over year basis remained challenged by the fact that a significant percentage of our flights operate out of three of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us year compared to year we reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in in  we had operating income of million  an increase of million over  and an operating margin of  up points from diluted earnings per share were for compared to diluted earnings per share of for operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to a increase in passenger revenues 
the million increase in passenger revenues was attributable to a increase in capacity with a increase in yield and a point increase in load factor over  amounts which include capacity reductions during the initial cutover period to our new customer service system in the first quarter of included in this amount is a million increase in even more legroom revenue as a result of increased capacity and revised pricing

although we experienced significant revenue growth in  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance

in october  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec relating to our sale  from time to time  in one or more public offerings of debt securities  pass through certificates  common stock  preferred stock and or other securities 
the net proceeds of any securities we sell under this registration statement may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities in or near airports 
through december   we had not issued any securities under this registration statement 
at this time  we have no plans to sell securities under this registration statement 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
substantially all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and all but one of the remaining were financed by secured debt 
we also leased one additional aircraft which we took delivery of in december but which was not yet placed in service 
we have received committed financing for the nine aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot give assurance that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to pay in cash  further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had working capital of million at december   compared to million at december  our working capital includes the fair value of our short term fuel hedge derivatives  which was an asset of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at december   we had million invested in ars  which were included in long term investments 
beginning in february  all of the ars then held by us experienced failed auctions which resulted in us continuing to hold these securities beyond the initial auction reset periods 
auction failures continued for some time and there was a general lack of liquidity in the market 
as a result  we participated in settlement agreements with ubs  whereby they repurchased all of the ars brokered by them beginning in june at par value 
additionally  in october  we entered into an agreement with citigroup global markets  inc  whereby they repurchased all of our then outstanding ars issued by them for approximately million 
as of december   we no longer hold any ars 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by financing activities  as they may be available to us 
we expect to continue to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  economic conditions  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies and or consolidations  us military actions or acts of 
table of contents terrorism 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions payments due in total thereafter long term debt and capital lease obligations lease commitments flight equipment obligations financing obligations and other total includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was seven years at december  we are not subject to any financial covenants in any of our debt obligations 
our spare parts pass through certificates issued in november require us to maintain certain non financial collateral coverage ratios  which could require us to provide additional spare parts collateral or redeem some or all of the related equipment notes 
during  we posted million in cash collateral in order to maintain the required ratios for the spare parts pass through certificates 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment was collateralized 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire between and one of the aircraft under operating lease was not yet in service at december  five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have approximately million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related lease terms 
including the effects of the amendments to our airbus and embraer purchase agreements  our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in  in  in  in  in  and in we have the right to cancel three firm embraer deliveries in or later  provided no more than two deliveries are canceled in any one year 
we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire eight additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
in october  we began operating out of our new terminal at jfk  or terminal  which we had been constructing since november the construction and operation of this facility is governed by a lease agreement that we entered into with the panynj in we are responsible for making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution in and facility rents that commenced in october upon our occupancy of the new terminal 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the new terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the 
table of contents panynj has reimbursed us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that have been provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project is being accounted for as a financing obligation  with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our balance sheets 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases in are projected to be approximately million 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless the employee is terminated for cause or the employee elects not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities  as defined by the consolidations topic of the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards codification tm  or codification  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of additional liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we use a policy provider to provide credit support on our class g and class g floating rate enhanced equipment notes 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to 
table of contents prepare our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer in the air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights that are expected to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive operating cash flows  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
share based compensation 
under the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification  stock based compensation expense is required to be recorded for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock incentive plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a lattice model  which incorporates our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
the expected term of restricted stock units is based on the requisite service period of the awards being granted 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of two year publicly traded options on our common stock as of the option grant date 
our decision to use a blend of historical and implied volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term and periodic adjustments of lease rates  landing fees  and other charges applicable under such agreements  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent 
table of contents expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease term and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a million asset related to the net fair value of these derivative instruments  the majority of which are not traded on a public exchange 
fair values are assigned based on commodity prices that are provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
the derivatives and hedging topic is a complex accounting standard and requires that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
fair value measurements 
we adopted the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements  on january  the fair value measurements and disclosures topic clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
the fair value measurements and disclosures topic also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based on significant levels of inputs 
we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  including ars and our interest rate swaps 
we elected to apply the fair value option under the financial instruments topic of the codification to an agreement with one of our ars broker  to repurchase in  at par 
the fair value of the put was determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars  as described above  to their par values and also considered the credit risk associated with the broker 
this put option was adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the fair value of the put option was based on unobservable inputs and was therefore classified as level in the hierarchy 
this put option was fully exercised in upon its expiration 
in february and february  we entered into various interest rate swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps were initially based on inputs received from the counterparty 
these values were corroborated by adjusting the active swap indications in quoted markets for similar terms years for the specific terms within our swap agreements 
there was no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate swaps in since all critical terms continued to match the underlying debt  with all of the unrealized losses being deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  or trueblue 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of outstanding points earned from jetblue purchases that we expect to be redeemed 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
we adjust this liability  which is included in air traffic liability  based on points earned and redeemed  changes in the estimated incremental costs associated with providing travel and changes in the trueblue program 
in november  we launched an improved version of trueblue  which allows customers to earn points based on the value paid for a trip rather than the length of the trip 
in addition  unlike 
table of contents our original program  the improved version does not result in the automatic generation of a travel award once minimum award levels are reached  but instead the points are maintained in the account until used by the member or until they expire months after the last account activity 
as a result of these changes we expect breakage  or the points that ultimately expire unused  to be substantially reduced 
estimates of breakage for the improved version of trueblue have been made based on a simulation of the improved program rules using our historical data 
as more data is collected by us on our members behaviors in the program  these estimates may change 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
points in trueblue can also be sold to participating companies  including credit card and car rental companies 
these sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  with one element representing the fair value of the travel that will ultimately be provided when the points are redeemed and the other consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company 
the fair value of the transportation portion of these point sales is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided 
the marketing portion  which is the excess of the total sales proceeds over the estimated fair value of the transportation to be provided  is recognized in other revenue when the points are sold 
deferred revenue for points sold and not redeemed is recognized as revenue when the underlying points expire 
deferred revenue was million at december  the terms of expiration of all points under our original loyalty program were modified with the launch of a new version of trueblue in we recorded million and million in revenue for point expirations in and  respectively 
our co branded credit card agreement  under which we sell trueblue points as described above  provides for a minimum cash payment guarantee  which is to be paid to us throughout the life of the agreement if specified point sales and other ancillary activity payments have not been achieved 
through december   we had received million in connection with this guarantee  which is subject to refund in the event that cash payments exceed future minimums through april we record revenue related to this guarantee when the likelihood of us providing any future service is remote 
during  we recognized approximately million related to this guarantee  leaving million deferred and included in our air traffic liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or jet fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by december  we expect to realize approximately million in gains during currently in other comprehensive income related to our outstanding fuel hedge contracts 
interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than 
table of contents they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would remain relatively constant  compared to a million decrease for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
