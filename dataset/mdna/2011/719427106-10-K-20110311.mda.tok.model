company overview we specialize in developing and marketing innovative  premium priced products for the mass market channel 
our products focus on addressing skin imperfections through a problem solution approach  unlike competitors whose products focus primarily on changing fashion trends 
our products address specific  everyday cosmetics needs and include face powders  bronzers  concealers  blushes  foundations  eye shadows  eyeliners  brow makeup and mascaras 
we sell our products to mass market retailers such as wal mart  cvs  target and rite aid 
our products provide above average profitability for retailers due to their higher price points and sales per linear foot 
our products are currently sold in approximately  of the  stores in which we estimate our masstige competitors products are sold 
we seek to be first to market with new products within this channel  and are able to take new products from concept development to shipment in less than months 
new products are a very important part of our business and have contributed  on average  approximately of our gross sales from to factors affecting our operating results our net sales are impacted by advertising  discounts and promotions  merchandising  packaging  the availability of wall display space at our retailer customers  inventory management at retailers and the timing of new product launches and line extensions  all of which have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
continued growth of our net sales and profitability will depend substantially on the continued popularity of our new and existing products  our ability to effectively manage our sales and distribution networks and our ability to maintain sufficient product supply to meet expected growth in demand 
from to  we experienced rapid revenue growth and increased demand for our premium priced products 
this pattern changed in as a result of deteriorating economic conditions  we experienced lessened demand for our products and tightening of inventory levels with our retail customers 
our net sales moderated in the second half of and declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was attributable in large part to the loss of a major customer  deteriorating global economic conditions and tightening of inventory levels with our retail customers 
the strong performance of our new product launches and improved product return rates contributed to the modest increase in net sales of during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   which was partially offset by a decrease in us sales as retailers worked down their inventory levels in response to soft consumer demand and the loss of a major customer  as discussed below 
late in the first quarter of  one of our largest retail customers informed us that  as a result of a change in strategy  the customer intended to reduce its space allotted to the entire color cosmetics category in its stores in in april  this customer informed management of its decision to completely discontinue selling our products in rather than implementing only a reduction in the number of our products sold in the stores 
this customer began to reduce its inventory levels of our products to prepare for the discontinuation during the second quarter of  which had a material negative impact on our net sales 
this change eliminated our distribution in approximately  stores 
this customer accounted for and of our gross sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not have any sales to this customer during the year ended december   but have been re introduced on their online business in while this is a positive contributor to  we do not expect the sales growth from this development to be material next year unless it leads to a brick and mortar distribution with this retailer 
our cost of sales includes our costs to manufacture products in our own facilities  including raw material and labor costs and all overhead expenses related to production and quality control  as well as the cost to purchase components  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes  and semi finished goods  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes filled with product  from third party manufacturers and inbound freight 
we primarily purchase plastic component parts from manufacturers in china  rather than purchasing them through brokers 
the automation of an assembly line and our use of components and semi finished goods as well as our own manufacturing facilities have allowed us to maintain significant production flexibility 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include all warehouse and outbound freight expenses  selling  marketing  research and development costs  finance  information technology  depreciation  amortization of intangibles  professional fees  non cash charges for stock based compensation for certain employees and administrative and distribution facility expenses 
our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year and when events or circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
due to the significant downturn in the economy and the deterioration of the market price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of  we tested goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december  based on this analysis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million representing the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill and a million non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of the trade names to their fair value 
during the six months ended june   the downturn in the economy continued which significantly lowered consumer discretionary spending 
additionally  the market capitalization of the company continued to decline 
as a result of our annual impairment testing of the trade names as of june   trade names with a carrying amount of million were written down to their fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  we tested trade names for impairment as of june   and based on the analysis  an impairment charge was not recorded as the fair value of the trade names exceed their carrying value 
factors affecting comparability seasonality our business  similar to others in the cosmetic industry  is subject to seasonal variation due to the annual sell in period when retailers decide how much retail space will be allotted to each supplier and the number of new and existing products to be offered in their stores 
for us  this period has historically been from december through april 
sales during these months are typically greater due to the shipments required to fill the inventory at retail stores and retailers warehouses 
retailers typically reset their retail selling space during these months to accommodate changes in space allocation to each supplier and to incorporate the addition of new products and the deletion of slow selling items 
our net sales for the three months ended december  were higher than our net sales for the three months ended september   as a result of this seasonality 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of reasons  including the timing of new product introductions  general economic conditions or consumer buyer behavior 
in addition  results for any one quarter may not be indicative of results for the same quarter in subsequent years

net sales increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in our provision for returns  a decrease in trade spending  an increase in net sales of our new products compared to our new products  partially offset by a decrease in gross sales driven by the lack of sales in to the major customer that discontinued the sale of our products in the second quarter of because of this discontinuation  we had no sales to this customer during the year ended december   but during the year ended december   net sales to this customer were million 
our provision for returns decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to a decline in expected returns from retailers 
the drivers of the lower expected returns from our retailers are the lack of sales to the customer which discontinued our products in and had a historically higher product return rate  and the absence of returns of higher priced promotional kits which are no longer being sold but which were returned in large volumes in provision for returns as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for returns as a percentage of net sales was due to the factors mentioned above

cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of sales resulted primarily from a lower provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory  driven in part from the benefits of the sku rationalization implemented at the end of  which was partially offset by lower than anticipated recoveries of returns driven by lower actual return levels compared to the prior year and the deterioration of product mix due to the increased sale of lower margin eye products

selling  general and administrative expenses

also contributing to the decrease was a  decrease in distribution costs  a  decrease in bad debt expense  a  decrease in freight and warehouse costs  which were partially offset by a  increase in sales force and sales administrative expenses  a  decrease in realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and a  increase in corporate administrative costs 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of million for the impairment of our trade names 
we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and when events or circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
this non cash impairment charge does not impact our overall business operations 
no such impairment charge was recorded during based on our impairment analysis

the decrease in sales of our makeup products was primarily due to the loss of a major customer  which accounted for million of the decrease  lower canadian sales of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to december   reduction of sales of higher priced promotional kits that were only featured in and tight inventory control by retailers leading to destocking  which reduced the pipeline orders for new products during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  our provision for returns decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to a decline in expected returns from our retailers 
our provision for returns decreased for the year ended december  because we expect lower returns as a result of the loss of a major customer  from which we no longer expect to receive returns and no longer have any ongoing sales to such customer 
as a result of excluding this customer from our returns provision during  our returns provision decreased by approximately  in addition  at the end of  we discontinued the higher priced promotional kits that were sold in  that had a significantly higher return rate than our other products

the increase in our provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a higher number of product discontinuances in the fourth quarter of in connection with our retailers annual store resets  the overall decline in sales and the introduction of a significant amount of new products in in addition  the implementation of a sku rationalization initiative designed to discontinue slower selling products contributed to the increase in our provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
this initiative  which was concluded in late december after plan o grams were finalized with our retail partners  resulted in the discontinuation of approximately of our products as of december  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales includes an increase in product costs of

days sales outstanding dso  as calculated on a trailing month basis  decreased days  to days at december  from days at december  dso increased days  to days at december  from days at december  dso decreased from to primarily because of our increased collection efforts in dso increased from to because of the economic downturn and tightening of credit in the financial markets had  in some cases  adversely impacted our customers ability to make timely payments to us 
in addition  for certain selected customers who we deemed to be creditworthy based upon their prior payment history  and for certain promotional items  we extended our standard payment terms from net days to net days or net days 
we regularly reevaluate our customers ability to satisfy their credit obligations and record a provision for doubtful accounts based on such evaluations 
in addition  we implemented a customer credit watch in the fourth quarter of  requiring management approval for all orders from customers that have been identified as a potential credit risk 
as of december   we had million of accounts receivable  net  of which million had not been collected as of february  as of december   we had million of accounts receivable  net  of which million and million had not been collected as of february  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended december   our inventory turnover rate was times  which is relatively consistent with our inventory turnover rate for the year ended december  of times 
we categorize our inventories into three groups salable inventory  excess slow moving inventory and obsolete inventory 
salable inventory are products that remain in distribution and for which we have less than twelve months of forecasted sales of inventory on hand 
slow moving inventory are products that also remain in distribution  but for which we have more than twelve months of forecasted sales of inventory on hand 
obsolete inventory are products that no longer are in distribution with our retailer customers 
we assess and reserve for salable  slow moving and obsolete inventory throughout the year based on our historical experience in conjunction with an analysis of our current slow moving and obsolete inventory levels  forecasted plans and sales trends and planned product discontinuances 
our assessment includes discussions with our retailer customers about products to include in future retail store shelf layouts and if a product loses distribution across all retail partners  it will be deemed obsolete 
our retailer customers typically decide upon changes to their shelf layouts annually and these decisions usually occur in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the new calendar year 
our planned product discontinuances were significant in compared to historical periods due to the overall decline in sales to our retailer customers resulting in a reduction of individual products offered based on individual product performance metrics coupled with the introduction of new products 
based on the above process  our provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in our provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the benefits of our year end sku rationalization and the introduction of fewer new products in the increase in our provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a higher number of product discontinuances in the fourth quarter of in connection with our retailers annual store resets  the overall decline in sales and the introduction of a significant amount of new products in based on the factors identified above  we anticipate that we will be able to fully realize the value of our net inventory 
however  our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand and sales trends 
if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate  we may need to increase our provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory which could adversely affect our operating results and liquidity

future liquidity and capital needs 
our net working capital increased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  working capital requirements typically increase during the fourth quarter  when we experience higher inventory levels as we produce new products for shipment in the first quarter of the following year 
we budgeted capital expenditures of million for for several key projects  including million in investments in retail permanent fixtures   in improvements to other manufacturing and distribution equipment   in improvements to our information technology infrastructure   to upgrade a product assembly line and  in improvements to our research and development equipment 
we expected capital requirements related to fixture infrastructure to total million for the period from september inception of the project to december  of which million was incurred as of december  we incurred  for capital expenditures and million for investments in retail permanent fixtures for the year ended december  we estimate that our net working capital requirements will increase to million in from million in we have budgeted capital expenditures of million for  compared to million in  which consists of million of property and equipment expenditures and million of retail permanent fixture expenditures 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and funds from our financing arrangements entered into during november will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case

the senior subordinated note is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries and is secured by a first lien on certain intellectual property and a second lien on substantially all of our other assets and those of our subsidiaries and our pledges of the stock and those of our subsidiaries 
the value of the collateral subject to these liens is limited to the lesser of of the value of the assets of physicians formula holdings  inc and its subsidiaries and of the value of all outstanding common stock of physicians formula holdings  inc as of november  the cap 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement entered into between physicians  mill road and wells fargo in connection with the new senior credit agreement and note agreement the new intercreditor agreement  the senior subordinated note is subordinate in right of payment to the prior paying of all obligations under the new senior credit agreement and the liens securing the obligations under the note agreement are junior and subordinate to the liens securing the obligations under the new senior credit agreement except for first liens on certain intellectual property 
in addition  the new intercreditor agreement prohibits certain amendments to the note agreement without the consent of wells fargo and prohibits certain amendments to the new senior credit agreement without the consent of mill road 
in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated note  mill road agreed that  until september   it would not acquire more than of the our common stock or seek to elect any directors to the board other than the one director it is entitled to nominate while the senior subordinated note is outstanding  in each case  without obtaining the prior written consent of the board 
these restrictions will be released if we receives a bid for the acquisition of the company other than from mill road or its affiliates 
as required under the note agreement  we sought stockholder approval in order to comply with the nasdaq shareholder approval requirements and to satisfy certain sections of the delaware general corporation law  because mill road is an interested stockholder for purposes of the statute 
because mill road is an interested stockholder  we were required to obtain the vote of of the outstanding common stock not owned by mill road to approve the transactions 
at the special meeting of the stockholders held on april   the stockholders approved  by the requisite margin  a second amendment to the senior subordinated note the second amendment and the issuance of warrants to mill road 
on april   we  our subsidiaries and mill road entered into the second amendment 
under the second amendment  mill road agreed to reduce the interest rate on the senior subordinated note from per annum payable in cash monthly and payable in kind with quarterly compounding to per annum payable in cash monthly and payable in kind with annual compounding  and to extend the maturity of the senior subordinated note by months to november  the prepayment premium for an optional redemption was also amended so that if the senior subordinated note is redeemed on or after november  and prior to november   the prepayment premium would be  decreasing to if redeemed on or after november  and prior to november   and decreasing to if redeemed on or after november  in addition  the existing limit on the amount of collateral securing the senior subordinated note was removed 
in addition  as required by the note purchase agreement and as consideration for the reduction in interest payments  on april   we entered into a common stock purchase warrant agreement with mill road pursuant to which warrants have been issued entitling mill road to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price equal to per share and expire on april  upon issuance of the warrants  mill road beneficially owned  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  representing aggregate beneficial ownership of  shares approximately of our common stock 
on june   we  our subsidiaries and mill road entered into a third amendment to the senior subordinated note the third amendment 
pursuant to the third amendment  mill road has the right to nominate one individual to serve as a member of our board of directors the board so long as a the outstanding principal amount under the senior subordinated note is no less than million and mill road owns shares of  or securities convertible into  or exercisable for  our capital stock  or b mill road owns no less than of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis and any part of the senior subordinated note is outstanding 
in addition  in the third amendment  we agree to i increase the size of the board and appoint mill road nominee to the board  and ii recommend to our stockholders that mill road nominee to the board be elected to the board at the annual meetings of stockholders clauses i and ii together  the company obligations  in each case so long as the conditions in clauses a or b of the immediately preceding sentence are met 
prior to the third amendment  mill road had the right to nominate one individual to serve as a member of the board and we had an obligation to perform the company obligations  in each case so long as the senior subordinated note was outstanding 
on february   we  our subsidiaries and mill road entered into the fourth amendment to the senior subordinated note the fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment establishes our financial covenants that will apply to periods after december   including our minimum book net worth covenant  minimum adjusted ebitda covenant and maximum capital expenditures covenant 
in addition  commencing with the quarter ending march   we are required to comply with a quarterly minimum adjusted ebitda covenant calculated on a month period basis 
our financial covenants with mill road reflect an approximate cushion from those of wells fargo 
the fourth amendment also required us to negotiate with mill road  no later than april   our financial covenants that will apply to future periods not covered by this amendment 
in connection with the new revolving credit facility and senior subordinated note  and the amendments thereto  we incurred total costs of million associated with these agreements  which included  and  of closing fees paid to wells fargo and mill road  respectively 
the issuance of the warrants and reduction in interest payments has been accounted for as a partial conversion of the required payments under the note purchase agreement for equity interests under asc  debt with conversion and other options asc 
asc requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments to separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers borrowing rate at the date of issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature 
asc requires bifurcation of a component of the convertible debt instrument  classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as interest expense 
the equity component of the senior subordinated note was  at the time of issuance and was applied as debt discount and as additional paid in capital 
additionally  during  we recorded the income tax effect of the debt discount of  to additional paid in capital  as a reduction of the  recorded above  and established a corresponding deferred income tax liability 
the unamortized discount for the senior subordinated note will be amortized through the debt maturity date of november  the effective interest rate on the liability component of the senior subordinated note is 
interest expense related to the contractual coupon rate was million for the year ended december  interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount was  for the year ended december  long term debt and the equity component of the senior subordinated note as of december  is as follows in thousands senior subordinated note unamortized discount accrued payable in kind interest net carrying value of senior subordinated note equity component of senior subordinated note the estimated fair value of the senior subordinated note  based on publicly traded debt of comparable companies with similar features  was approximately million compared to its carrying value of million at december  contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years revolving credit facility long term debt interest payments on long term debt obligation operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total other long term liabilities consist of insurance financing and deferred compensation and exclude obligations for uncertain tax positions of  as the timing of payment cannot be reasonably estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts that rely on estimation techniques to calculate fair value 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure as of the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  returns  trade allowances  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from direct sales to retailers and wholesalers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales a reserve for product returns  which includes actual returns to date and an amount established for anticipated product returns  as well as trade allowances 
our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer 
allowances for estimated returns are provided for when the related sales are recorded 
we continually review and revise our sales returns estimates based on actual product returns and recoverability  planned product discontinuances and promotional sales 
in the past  returns provisions have been adjusted higher or lower during the course of a fiscal year depending on actual results to date and anticipated returns for the remainder of a year 
experience has shown a relationship between gross sales and sales returns in the subsequent period  as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for known or anticipated events that we have considered  and will continue to consider  including the solvency of our customers  store closings by retailers  changes in the retail environment and decisions regarding new and existing products 
actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual returns exceed reserves  we would need to reduce our net sales at the time of such determination 
we have not experienced any material differences between the allowances for estimated returns and actual returns 
our provision for returns was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our provision for decreased compared to due to a decline in expected returns from our retailers resulting from the loss of a major customer  from which we no longer expect to receive returns  the discontinuance of higher priced promotional kits that were sold in  that had a significantly higher return rate than our other products  and the overall decline in gross sales 
our provision for decreased compared to due to a decline in expected returns from our retailers resulting from the loss of a major customer  from which we no longer expect to receive returns  the discontinuance of higher priced promotional kits that were sold in  that had a significantly higher return rate than our other products  and the overall decline in gross sales 
we offer trade allowances such as rebates  price protection  coupons and other incentives to customers in the normal course of business 
we also have arrangements with customers pursuant to our trade terms to reimburse them for a portion of their advertising costs  which provide advertising benefits to us or incentivize our retail customers or the end consumer 
these arrangements include cash discounts  markdown allowances  cooperative advertising  retail marketing  coupons  warehouse allowances and miscellaneous allowances collectively  trade allowances 
in addition  from time to time  we may pay fees to customers in order to place products on end caps or expand or maintain space for its products 
trade allowances are provided for based on estimates  including anticipated deductions to be taken by our customers for the trade allowance programs provided to them  and historical experience 
trade allowances and end cap placement and shelf placement costs  if any  are recorded as incurred as an offset against sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also record certain non cash consideration given to customers for trade allowance programs to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have not experienced any material differences between the trade allowance accruals and actual trade allowances 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are identified based on historical trends  sales projections and future known or anticipated events  including planned discontinuance of products 
when inventory is identified as slow moving or obsolete  we record an inventory write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on the amounts we expect to recover from third parties  including our arrangement with a third party liquidator 
this write down is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
we have not experienced any material differences between write downs and actual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and specific intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
in accordance with asc  goodwill was not amortized and was tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
to apply asc  a company is divided into separate reporting units  each representing groups of activities that are separately managed 
for this purpose  we have one reporting unit 
in addition to the annual impairment test  we assessed whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicated that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by a comparative market approach based on recent share prices and includes a control premium based on recent transactions that have occurred in our industry 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test involves preparing an allocation of the fair value of our reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
given that the continued downturn in the us economy during the fourth quarter of significantly lowered consumer discretionary spending  which lowered the demand for our products  along with the continued deterioration of our market capitalization  we tested goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  for impairment 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million representing the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
other indefinite lived intangible assets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets consist exclusively of trade names 
the physicians formula trade name has been used since and is a recognized brand within the cosmetics industry 
it is management s intent to leverage the trade names indefinitely into the future 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
the fair value of the trade names is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief from royalty approach 
the relief from royalty approach is an income approach that utilizes certain market information by reference to the amount of royalty income we could generate if the trade names were licensed  in an arm length transaction  to a third party 
based on a comparison of our trade names to the guideline transactions  including an assessment of industry conditions  the age of the trademark trade name  degree of consumer recognition and life cycle of the brand  a reasonable royalty rate is estimated for the trade names 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected net sales  discount rate  royalty rate and terminal value assumptions level inputs 
if our net sales or other estimated factors are not achieved at or above the forecasted level  this may adversely affect the estimated fair value of the trade names and the carrying value may prove unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
the critical assumptions that affect projected net sales and the discount rate assumptions are i the number of retail stores in which we have distribution  which  in turn  could be affected by the loss or gain of a customer s  in whole or in part  ii the number of products we sell on average in each of our retail customer stores  iii the sales price of our products to our customers  which can be affected by general consumer confidence  competitive dynamics and the degree of innovation in our products relative to that of our competition  and iv the rate of returns that we expect to receive from sales to our customers  which are offsets to our gross sales 
customers evaluate whether to keep our products in distribution using a variety of factors  the most meaningful of which include the rate of sales of our products in their stores  the margin our customers generate from the sales of our products  and the amount of cooperative advertising and trade allowance programs that we invest in to support the sales of our products in their stores and such programs are offsets to our gross sales 
typically  products that are returned relate to either special promotions that did not sell through at our retail customers or products which our retail customers are not including in their planned annual plan o gram reset for the upcoming year 
the discount rate is affected by the company  and selected guideline public companies  capital structure ratio of debt and equity financing and the related cost of debt and equity financing  and both can be significantly affected by changes in the capital markets eg general availability of debt and equity for companies with our risk profile and the degree of risk and stability analysts  investors  potential investors  and other market participants perceive in our cash flow performance 
as a result of the conditions identified above under goodwill  we conducted an impairment test as of december   which resulted in a million non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of the trade names to their fair value of million 
as a result of our annual impairment testing of the trade names as of june   trade names with a carrying amount of million were written down to their fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which was included in the operating results for the year ended december  no such impairment charge was recorded during based on our impairment analysis performed as of june  definite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets consist primarily of patents and distributor relationships we use the terms distributor and customer interchangeably  thus such distributor relationships represented of our entire customer base of retailer customers at the time of the management buyout and stock purchase transaction in 
patents and distributor relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
intangible assets related to patents and distributor relationships are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
management estimated the useful life of the patents on the base technology that has been in existence for many years and is expected to continue through the estimated useful life 
the useful life of the distributor relationships is based on our historical attrition analysis  which was used to calculate the rate of drop off or loss of customer sales over time  for all of our customers distributors at the time of the management buyout and stock purchase transaction 
we used our aggregate sales for these customers over a historical period of time to calculate an implied average annual customer attrition rate  which converted into the year estimated useful life of the distributor customer relationships 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of our distributor relationships intangible asset in accordance with asc in connection with the loss of one of our largest retailer customers  we updated our attrition analysis based on historical information through june  and adjusted the analysis for the loss of such customer 
from the date of the management buyout and stock purchase transaction in through june   we have been able to significantly increase our sales by expanding our total distribution among our then existing customers through increases in the number of retail stores in which our customers sell our product and through increases in the total number of products sold at each of our customers stores 
based upon our updated attrition analysis  we noted that the loss of one of our largest retailer customers was offset by the growth in our sales to our then existing customers since therefore  since the resulting attrition rate approximated the previous historical attrition rate  we concluded that there was not a significant impact to the remaining period of amortization related to our distributor relationships intangible asset 
we tested the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets at the asset group level  which we determined to be at the entity level  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  as of december  and june  as events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of the asset group was based on the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset group  which we then compared to the related carrying value of the asset group 
the material inputs into these projections include assumptions regarding estimates of revenue growth rates  gross profit margins  and operating expenses  which were adjusted for known events and circumstances as of the date of our recoverability testing  including the adverse impact from the loss of one of our largest retailer customers 
based upon the results of our recoverability test of the asset group  the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the asset group carrying value is recoverable and no impairment charge was required for our distributor relationships and patents intangible assets 
we did not perform a recoverability test of our definite lived intangible assets during as there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our impairment test for all of our intangible assets includes assumptions regarding the expected cash flows generated by the assets 
the most critical assumptions to our profitability and cash flow projections are our forecasted net sales and product costs 
the most critical assumptions for our projected net sales are discussed under other indefinite lived intangible assets above 
the most significant assumptions affecting our product costs relate to our procurement costs for both raw materials and semi finished goods  which can be affected by inflation  the complexity of our product formulations  freight and fuel costs and the financial condition of our suppliers 
inherent in any of these assumptions are uncertainties regarding the outcome of our projected sales growth rates  profit margins and operating expenses 
differences between current expectations and future outcomes realized may lead to significant changes in the fair value of our intangible assets  which may result in the incurrence of substantial losses by us 
additionally  we will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of the above impairments  and these impairments did not impact our financial covenant compliance under our debt agreements or our ongoing financial performance 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
under asc  which indicates that share based payments awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock will be based on companies of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected life of options granted represents management s best estimate based upon historical and expected trends in the company s stock option activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets of million as of december  will be utilized 
in arriving at this conclusion we are relying on both the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities and the projection of future taxable income from operations 
of the deferred income tax liabilities  approximately million are scheduled to reverse with the appropriate attributes sufficient to utilize the deferred income tax assets recognized as of december  we anticipate that our projected taxable income from operations in future years will exceed million  therefore we anticipate we will be able to utilize the remaining deferred income tax assets of million 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence when projecting future taxable income from operations and give more weight to evidence that is objectively verifiable  including our historical three year cumulative taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that we will exceed these requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate pre tax income in the future  this could result in recognizing a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
environmental matters as discussed under item business  we have environmental liabilities at our city of industry facilities 
these involve both onsite and regional groundwater contamination 
we also have indemnities that have covered  and that we expect will continue to cover  most of these environmental liabilities 
the indemnities were given to us by prior owners of the business  by a former operator of the facility and its insurer  by a prior owner s successor  and by a company with which we entered into a settlement indemnifying us for further regional groundwater contamination liabilities 
based on our agreement and our past dealings with these entities and the nature of their contractual commitments  we expect that they will continue to indemnify most of our environmental liabilities 
some of the entities could contest a future indemnification demand we could make for some aspects of our potential environmental liabilities 
we believe all of the entities are financially able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us 
climate change the growing political and scientific opinion is that global weather patterns ie climate are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases ghgs in the earth s atmosphere 
this view and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives  some of which have already been enacted and others which are still being contemplated  aimed at reducing ghg emissions  both in the us and in overseas markets 
there are currently climate change environmental laws and regulations in the us and overseas markets to which we are subject  and there are many new laws and regulations being contemplated by the us and international law making and regulatory bodies to which we could be subject in the future 
to the best of our knowledge  we are not in violation of any current environmental laws or regulations  including those pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions 
the only current federal climate change law and regulation that affects our us plants is the epa ghg reporting rule 
we cannot predict whether a federal climate change bill will be enacted or whether epa regulations or additional state regulations will be promulgated 
furthermore  if such laws or regulations are promulgated  we cannot predict what requirements will arise  given the uncertain nature of prospective laws and regulations 
specifically  we cannot predict what requirements will be included in the state of california climate change regulations 
based on current state evaluations  it is likely the california climate change program will not impose requirements on facilities that emit less than  tons of ghg per year 
our preliminary evaluation using epa guidance is that each of our us facilities are likely to emit much less than  tons of ghgs per year 
in general  the economic impacts to companies that do not emit greater than  tons of ghgs per year should be less than companies which emit more than  tons of ghgs per year  the impact for companies that emit less than  tons of ghg per year is primarily increased energy  transportation and raw materials costs 
given that our operations do not currently use large amounts of energy or emit significant ghg emissions  we do not currently foresee any future climate change laws or regulations requiring significant capital spending  which could materially impact our future financial results and liquidity 
we have also attempted to determine whether our suppliers both those in the us and outside the us  notably the manufacturers of our powders and components  are in compliance with international and us environmental laws and regulations 
given the nature of this segment of the manufacturing sector eg they are not large  energy intensive plants and the lack of enforceable requirements in many countries  we believe them to be in compliance 
however  we cannot conclusively determine their status 
as new laws and regulations are adopted  the impacts on our suppliers may change 
furthermore  given the uncertain nature of environmental laws and regulations  we cannot predict the impact of prospective environmental laws and regulations on our suppliers 
we will continue to seek information from our manufacturing suppliers on these impacts 
because climate change requirements do not currently impose significant capital spending requirements on our suppliers and these suppliers do not emit high levels of ghg emissions or have high energy usages  such climate change requirements are unlikely to have a material impact on our financial results or liquidity 
any cost increases are likely to be due to increased energy  transportation  or raw material costs  increases that are unlikely to apply uniquely to our supply chain 
we do business with some customers that have ghg emission and or energy reduction programs that apply to some of their supply chain providers and their upstream manufacturers 
it is likely that these customers will extend programs to more of their suppliers and the manufacturers who make the components of the products we sell to our customers 
such a future expansion could require us to reduce our lifecycle ghg emissions and energy usage to remain in good standing with these customers 
this  in turn  could lead to increased cost of goods and higher capital spending to deploy technologies required to reduce carbon emission and energy usage 
it is not possible to predict with certainty whether these actions will materially impact our financial results and liquidity 
however  as stated above  we believe our manufacturer s operations do not currently use large amounts of energy or emit significant amounts of ghgs  and  therefore  we do not currently foresee any future issues with complying with customer requirements 
significant changes in weather patterns  frequency and strength of storms and other weather effects could result from escalating  worldwide ghg emissions 
these altered weather patterns could result in changes in demand higher or lower for our products  notably products containing sun protection ie  in some locations  there may be more demand for sun protection and in other locations  there may be less 
alterations in weather patterns can also result in severe weather events  such as hurricanes or tornadoes  which may negatively impact the operations of our retail distribution operations 
we cannot predict changes in weather patterns  at what locations such weather changes may occur or whether the changes will increase or decrease costs eg climate change may decrease the number of snow storms or flooding in some locations 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in nature 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not currently affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of sales and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products offered by us 
forward looking statements this section and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  believes  plans  predicts  and similar terms 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to our dependence on a limited number of retailer customers  the loss of any of our retailer customers  fluctuations in buying decisions of our retailer customers  changes in general economic or market conditions  our ability to comply with covenants in our new senior credit agreement and senior subordinated note  our ability to repay or refinance borrowings under the senior credit agreement  the competitive environment in our industry  the demand for our products  loss of any of our key employees  our ability to expand our product offerings  our ability to expand through new and existing distribution channels  our ability to manage our growth and sustain profitability  our ability to protect our intellectual property  our cash needs and financial performance  variations in product quality or delays in order fulfillment  our operations and our ability to achieve cost savings  our dependence on third party suppliers  increases in minimum wages  catastrophic losses or other disruptions at any of our facilities  the effect of regulatory and technological changes  risks associated with doing business outside of the us and other factors discussed in item a 
risk factors risk related to our business and industry 
unless otherwise required by law  we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we sell to canadian customers in canadian dollars and pay overseas suppliers and third party manufacturers in us dollars 
an increase in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could result in lower net sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  we hold canadian dollars in a cash account which could result in higher unrealized foreign currency exchange losses due to a decrease in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the euro and the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar could cause our suppliers to raise prices that would result in higher cost of sales 
the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy 
our current sales to canadian customers and reliance on foreign suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used to produce products make it possible that our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies of our customers and suppliers 
we do not have any foreign currency hedges 
interest rate risk since november   we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our new senior credit agreement and previously under our old senior credit agreement 
interest on these borrowings is based upon variable interest rates 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  was million and the interest rate in effect at december  was 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a  change to interest expense for the year ended december
