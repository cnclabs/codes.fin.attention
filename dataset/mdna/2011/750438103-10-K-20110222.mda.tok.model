our more than  locations in the us and mexico give us a unique competitive advantage in scale  reach and convenience 
we strive to differentiate ourselves through an appealing store format  a comfortable store size  a carefully tailored product assortment  and knowledgeable sales experts 
we believe radioshack occupies unique advantages in the consumer electronics marketplace  providing an alternative to big box retailers we offer a broad selection of relevant technology products  including innovative mobile devices  accessories  and services  as well as items for personal and home technology and power supply needs 
our lineup features leading national brands and wireless carriers  as well as exclusive private brands 
we continue to capitalize on the growth of wireless communications and consumer demand for customer friendly wireless service plans and devices  our mobility assortment has been and will continue to be priced aggressively and is fully competitive with that of any alternative retailer or carrier 
we believe we have sufficient financial strength 
we believe we are efficient operators and are a high margin operation with a proven culture of cost control 
we have highly trained sales experts who offer friendly and personal service within an inviting  easy to shop store environment 
as with most other specialty retailers  our net sales and operating revenues  operating income and operating cash flows are greater during the fourth quarter  which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the united states and mexico 
external factors affecting our business since the fourth quarter of we have seen a highly challenging economy and muted consumer spending 
however  the consumer electronics industry  particularly the mobile phone industry  has experienced attractive growth rates over the past several years  driven by product innovations and new services 
the growth in mobile phones has been driven by growth in both the number of wireless subscribers and an increase in smartphones  which represent the latest in mobile phone technology 
a smartphone is a mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a basic feature wireless phone 
smartphones typically combine mobile phone capabilities with capabilities previously found on separate devices 
some examples include gps global positioning system navigation  memory players and camera capabilities 
we believe this convergence of capabilities into smartphones has contributed to a decline in several other product categories 
this convergence trend is likely to continue as smartphones evolve and as more consumers adopt smartphone technology 
according to the consumer electronics association cea  sales of consumer electronics are expected to remain strong  growing by more than in to billion due to the continued adoption of more portable digital products 
in  the cea estimates that smartphone revenues will increase nearly to more than billion 
the innovation in certain mature consumer electronic product categories  such as dvd players  camcorders and audio products  has not been sufficient to maintain average selling prices 
these mature products have become commoditized and have experienced price declines and reduced margins 
business strategy and performance our business strategy is focused around three specific goals strengthen our financial position and flexibility improve the quality of our operations  especially customer service strengthen our product offering and revitalize and contemporize our brand by taking a disciplined approach to cost control and focusing on profitable sales and the strength of our balance sheet  we have been able to make substantial progress toward all three goals 
over the past four years  we improved our margins  returned excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases  and controlled our costs 
at the same time  we continued to make operational improvements that reinforced our strategic themes of mobility  innovation  and service 
in the third quarter of  we added t mobile as a third national wireless carrier to our radioshack branded stores  positioning us to meet our customers desire for multi carrier options and to develop more aggressively our position in the wireless market 
in addition  we launched our new brand platform the shack that began to capture the attention of consumers and the marketplace 
we have continued to invest in strategic initiatives to drive our long term success  including growing our wireless business by taking advantage of our multiple wireless carrier retail position  the strong product growth cycle  and the growth in penetration of smartphones strengthening the offering in our non wireless product platforms by improving our merchandising talent  transitioning to a more productive product assortment  adding more national brands  and increasing exposure of these categories in targeted advertising and marketing maximizing our dealer and franchise operations by increasing our wireless offerings through these channels and developing a consistent brand experience partnering with other retailers such as target to provide wireless service offerings in their stores improving our use of real estate and taking advantage of the current commercial real estate market by reevaluating our leases for improved terms or reduced costs developing our international growth opportunities through our company owned stores in mexico as previously disclosed  in february we signed a contract extension with sam s club through march   with a transition period ending june   to continue operating wireless kiosks in certain sam s club stores 
as of december   we operated of these kiosks 
accordingly  this transition will begin on april   and conclude on june   with the assignment to sam s club of all kiosks operated by the company in sam s club stores 
in the third quarter of the company signed a multi year agreement with target corporation to operate wireless kiosks in certain target stores 
in august  we began to roll out target mobile kiosks  with the objective of operating kiosks in the majority of target stores nationwide by mid as of december   the company operated target mobile kiosks  and it expects to operate kiosks in approximately  target stores by june  thus  the sam s club transition coincides with the expansion of our kiosk program with target 
we expect a decline in kiosks segment operating income reflecting the impact of ramping up the new target mobile kiosks and eliminating the sam s club kiosks of approximately million to million in full year compared to full year  with growth in kiosks segment operating income expected to resume in following completion of the target mobile kiosk rollout 
results of operations summary net sales and operating revenues increased million  or  to  million when compared with last year 
comparable store sales increased 
this increase was driven by increased sales in our sprint and at t postpaid wireless business  increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets and airtime  and increased sales of wireless accessories 
these increases were partially offset by sales declines in digital to analog converter boxes  gps products  netbooks  digital televisions and digital cameras 
the inclusion of t mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier increased sales for the first nine months of  however  t mobile sales decreased in the fourth quarter  when compared to the same period last year 
gross margin decreased by basis points from last year to 
gross margin declined primarily due to a higher sales mix of lower margin wireless handsets and incremental promotional and clearance markdowns associated with seasonal sell through and product transitions in non wireless platforms 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million when compared with last year 
this increase was driven by incentive compensation paid on increased wireless sales  additional employees to support our target kiosk locations  and incremental advertising expense related to brand building in the second quarter of as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues  sg a decreased by basis points to 
as a result of the factors above  operating income increased million  or  to million when compared with last year 
net income increased million to million when compared with last year 
net income per diluted share was compared with last year 
adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  to million when compared with last year 
compared with wireless service provider settlement agreement the business terms of our relationships with our wireless service providers are governed by our wireless reseller agreements 
these contracts are complex and include provisions determining our upfront commission revenue  net of chargebacks for wireless service deactivations  our acquisition and return of wireless handsets  and  in some cases  future residual revenue  performance targets and marketing development funds 
disputes occasionally arise between the parties regarding the interpretation of these contract provisions 
certain disputes arose with one of the company s wireless service providers pertaining to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to july   and related chargebacks for wireless service deactivations 
negotiations regarding resolution of these disputes culminated in the signing of a settlement agreement in july in connection with the decision to settle these disputes  the company considered the following the timing of cash outflows and inflows in connection with the disputed upfront commission revenue and related chargebacks  and the estimated future residual revenue  the benefits of settling the disputes and agreeing to enter into good faith negotiations with the wireless service provider in the third quarter of to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement  and the risks associated with the ultimate realization of the estimated future residual revenue 
key elements of the settlement agreement include the following all disputes relating to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to july   and related chargebacks were settled 
the wireless service provider agreed to pay million to the company on or before july  the company and the wireless service provider agreed to enter into good faith negotiations in the third quarter of to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement 
beginning on july   the wireless service provider was no longer obligated to pay future residual revenue amounts to the company for a period of time for customers activated on or before june  for the first six months of  these residual revenue amounts averaged approximately million per quarter 
based on this average  we would receive no residual revenue payments from this wireless service provider for eight quarters beginning with the third quarter of under the terms of the settlement agreement 
the effects of the settlement agreement have been reflected in net sales and operating revenues in the consolidated financial statements for in the third quarter  we reached an agreement with this wireless service provider to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement  the terms of the amended wireless reseller agreement  and the performance of our business with this wireless service provider  we do not believe that these events will have a material effect on our results of operations for future periods

concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into note hedge transactions with citigroup and bank of america whereby we have the option to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price of per share the convertible note hedges  and we sold warrants to the same financial institutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a per share price of the warrants 
the convertible note hedges and warrants were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the convertible notes 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are separate contracts with the two financial institutions  are not part of the terms of the convertible notes  and do not affect the rights of holders under the convertible notes 
a holder of the convertible notes does not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedges or warrants 
the net proceeds retained by radioshack as a result of the issuance of the convertible notes  the purchase of the convertible note hedges  and the proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants were approximately million 
we completed these transactions to secure a source of liquidity prior to the june expiration of our million credit facility 
on september   we terminated this credit facility 
for a more detailed description of the convertible notes  convertible note hedges and warrants  please see note indebtedness and borrowing facilities and note stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long term notes on may   we issued million of year notes due may   the notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
the exchange resulted in substantially all of the notes becoming registered with the sec and did not result in additional debt being issued 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
the notes contain certain non financial covenants 
in june and august  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  and both with maturities in may our counterparty for these swaps is citigroup 
these swaps effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
for more information regarding our interest rate swaps  refer to note derivative financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  we completed a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of these notes 
upon expiration of the offer  million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes was validly tendered and accepted 
we paid a total of million  which consisted of the purchase price of million for the tendered notes plus million in accrued and unpaid interest  to the holders of the tendered notes 
on january   we announced our intention to redeem any and all outstanding notes on march  see note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus  to lower our capital requirements 
continuing lease obligations we have obligations under retail leases for locations that we assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these lease obligations arose from leases for which compusa inc compusa assumed responsibility as part of its purchase of our computer city  inc subsidiary in august because the company that assumed responsibility for these leases has ceased operations  we may be responsible for rent due under the leases 
following an announcement by compusa in february of its intention to close as many as stores and an announcement in december that it had been acquired by gordon brothers group  compusa s stores ceased operations in january we may be responsible for rent due on a portion of the leases that relate to the closed stores 
as of february   we had been named as a defendant in a total of lawsuits from lessors seeking payment from us  of which have been resolved 
based on all available information pertaining to the status of these lawsuits  and after applying the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  the balance of our accrual for these obligations was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we will continue to monitor this situation for new information on outstanding litigation and settlements  but we do not consider the amounts of these obligations  both individually and in the aggregate  to be material to our results of operations or financial position 
capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  dollars in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization short term debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization our debt to total capitalization ratio increased in from  primarily due to the repurchase of million of our common stock in dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for consecutive years 
on november   our board of directors declared an annual dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on december   to stockholders of record on november  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
share repurchases in july  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
during the third quarter of  we repurchased million shares or million of our common stock under this program 
as of december   million was available for share repurchases under this program 
in august  our board of directors approved a million increase in this share repurchase program 
as of december   million of the total authorized amount was available for share repurchases under this program 
in august  our board of directors approved an increase in this share repurchase program from million to million  with million available for share repurchases under this program 
in november  we completed a million accelerated share repurchase asr program that we entered into in august  which is further discussed below 
we repurchased million shares under the asr program 
in addition  after the conclusion of the asr program  we repurchased million worth of shares in the open market  representing million shares 
as of december   million of the total authorized amount was available for share repurchases under this program 
accelerated share repurchase program as mentioned above  in august  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with two investment banks to repurchase shares of our common stock under our approved share repurchase program 
on august   we paid million to the investment banks in exchange for an initial delivery of million shares to us 
at the conclusion of the asr program  we received an additional million shares 
the million shares delivered to us were based on the average daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over a period beginning immediately after the effective date of the asr agreements and ending on november  treasury stock retirement in december  our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock 
these shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation with the exception of increased energy costs in the first half of  inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future 
other matters separate from our wireless service provider settlement agreement in july  we notified t mobile that they had breached their agreement with us 
under the agreement  t mobile has until march   to cure the breaches 
in the event that t mobile is unable to cure the breaches  we have the right to terminate the agreement 
the outcome of this action is uncertain and the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition description our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
the third party service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer and  in some cases  a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue 
upfront commission revenue  net of estimated wireless service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time an activated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point of sale 
recurring residual revenue is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider  which is typically as the service provider bills its customer  generally on a monthly basis 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations 
our estimates for product refunds and returns  wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets  we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations 
however  our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers 
these factors include changes in the quality of their customer service  the quality and performance of their networks  their rate plan offerings  their policies regarding extensions of customer credit  and their wireless telephone handset product offerings 
these factors add uncertainty to our estimates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years 
we continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million in inventory valuation description our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost which approximates fifo or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances for self insurance  income taxes  and litigation contingencies description the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liabilities for insurance  tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items 
we use our history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items 
however  a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
although we believe that our insurance  tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill description long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
we estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
the original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates of future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fair value 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset or a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss for this difference 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment loss calculations for long lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and assumptions about market performance 
we also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model 
our impairment loss calculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values related to these assets 
we estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and other comparable market analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long lived assets  intangible assets  or goodwill during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating these impairment losses 
however  if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
the total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at december   was million 
of this amount  million related to goodwill from the purchase of radioshack de mexico 
based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment  we noted that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than their carrying values 
stock based compensation description we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with monte carlo simulations 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the black scholes merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected option life  volatility of stock prices  and employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock based compensation during the past three years 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in would have affected our net income by approximately million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in our md a and in other parts of this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the only derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks were interest rate swaps  which serve as an economic hedge on our long term debt 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
refer to note derivative financial instruments in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a change in annual net interest expense of million and an approximate million change to the fair value of our interest rate swaps  which would also affect net interest expense 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investment balance 
we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in china and other areas outside of the us our purchases are denominated in us dollars  however  the strengthening of the chinese currency  or other currencies  against the us dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them 
it is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our mexican subsidiary  which accounted for less than of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in
