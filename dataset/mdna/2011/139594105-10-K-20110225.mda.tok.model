other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities  net of any interest expense for capital leases and notes payable 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 
we believe ebitda presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance  because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  as it removes depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
however  free cash flow is not a recognized measurement under gaap  and when analyzing our cash generating ability  investors should use free cash flow in addition to  and not as an alternative for  cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe that free cash flow is a meaningful measure to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to assess our cash generating capabilities 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives 
our management uses free cash flow as an indicator of the company s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations 
cash flow from operating activities adds back non cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of cash generating capabilities as is used by management to compare our current cash generating capabilities with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview executive overview we are an online postsecondary education services company 
our wholly owned subsidiary  capella university  is a regionally accredited university that offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs primarily for working adults 
our newly formed joint venture sophia learning llc  in which we are the majority owners  provides a social teaching and learning platform that integrates education with technology 
over the past year we continued to position ourselves for long term success 
we have made great strides in developing offerings in our existing markets  emphasized growth in targeted professions and enhanced our differentiation as a high quality  online university by introducing eight new degree programs and new specializations across our markets 
in addition  we have achieved new or expanded accreditations and endorsements  including the new accreditation for our education programs by the national council for accreditation of teacher education or ncate 
the diversity of our program portfolio allows us to target relevant portions of the adult learner population and provide offerings in several of the highest demand areas of study  such as behavioral health and human services  business  information technology  education and public service leadership 
we believe we have the right strategies in place to continue to differentiate capella in our markets and drive growth 
we have identified five operating strategies related to learner success  producing affordable degrees  expanding our brand  serving a broader set of our learner s professional needs and establishing new growth platforms 
these strategies are enabled by technology and the talent of our faculty and employees 
we will continue to make investments in these enablers to continue to strengthen the foundation and future of our business 
we believe these strategies and enablers will allow us to continue to deliver high quality  affordable education  resulting in continued growth over the long term 
key trends  developments and challenges the following developments and trends present opportunities  challenges and risks toward achieving our goal of providing attractive returns to our shareholders introduction of new programs and specializations 
in  we launched new degree programs and new specializations  including the addition of doctoral  master s and bachelor s level programs within the newly entered public service leadership market 
in  we launched new degree programs and new specializations 
we expect to continue to introduce additional degree programs and specializations in the future as we believe this will further position capella for long term success 
certain types of new programs or specializations may require the department of education notification and or approval which would have an impact on the anticipated timeframe to launch new offerings 
we make investments in program and specialization development  support infrastructure and marketing and selling when introducing new programs and specializations  while associated revenues are dependent upon enrollment  which in many cases is lower during the period of new program and specialization introduction 
during the period of new program and specialization introduction  the rate of growth of revenues and operating income has been  and in the future may be  adversely affected in part due to these factors 
as our newer programs and specializations develop  we anticipate increases in enrollment  more cost effective delivery of instructional and support services and more efficient marketing and promotional processes 
establishing new growth platforms 
we seek to drive long term growth that is an extension of our core competencies into new markets 
we are pursuing this extension through the formation of a small business development team that is exploring early stage opportunities 
this may result in increased new business development costs focused on researching  identifying and cultivating these new opportunities 
competition for high quality inquiries 
as the industry has evolved in to address regulatory concerns  competition for high quality inquiries has increased at all degree levels 
the increased competition has resulted in higher costs to acquire high quality inquiries  especially through aggregator channels 
in addition  conversion rates are under pressure due to lower consumer demands and increased competition for high quality inquiries 
we are responding to the higher competition by reinforcing our commitment to quality within our targeted professional markets through a more strategic approach to our marketing mix 
we have moved a portion of our paid search activities in house for greater control and productivity within this channel 
in addition we are continuing to strengthen our relationships with our corporate and military partners 

table of contents however  even with the positive changes we have made to date  we continue to see increased pricing on quality leads and a reduction in the number of quality leads 
therefore we anticipate a greater need for marketing tests and increased brand spending  such as traditional media including television advertising 
building our brand awareness may put considerable pressure on marketing expenses in the near term  however we believe could have long term efficiencies on our channel strategy 
we expect the increased competition for high quality inquiries to continue to adversely impact our new and active enrollments  revenue and marketing spend in and potentially beyond 
initiative on improving graduation rates through high standards of academic quality and rigor 
as we continue to position capella to drive sustainable growth we are focused on improving graduation rates while maintaining a high standard of academic quality and rigor 
in order to further increase our focus on improving the learner experience and attracting learners who are more likely to persist in our programs  we have recently implemented various measures that are likely to affect our growth and profitability  at least in the near term  including the following continued increased investment in faculty development through the formation of the great teaching and learning center for excellence and innovative tools such as the technology offered through sophia 
upgrading our learning and data platforms  adopting new tools to better support learners education financing decisions  such as our responsible borrowing calculator  which is designed to help learners calculate the amount of learner borrowing necessary to achieve their educational objectives and to motivate them to not incur unnecessary student loan debt  transitioning our marketing approaches to more effectively identify learners who have the ability to succeed in our educational programs  including reduced emphasis on the utilization of third parties for inquiry generation  for our bachelor s learners  requiring all learners who enroll in capella university without transfer credits to complete an academic readiness pre assessment  and better aligning our enrollment  admissions and other employees to our learners success by resetting individual objectives and measures and implementing new compensation structures  including eliminating all enrollment related factors in our admissions and other personnel compensation structure effective january  we expect some of these initiatives may adversely impact our new and active enrollment and revenue in  and potentially beyond 
however  we believe these efforts are in the best interest of our learners and over the long term will improve graduation rates  which in turn will position us for more stable long term growth 
new enrollment growth 
we have historically experienced double digit new enrollment growth 
in the fourth quarter we experienced negative new enrollment growth and expect near term negative new enrollment growth 
we expect negative new enrollment growth to adversely impact our active enrollments  revenues  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reduction of workforce 
on february   the company announced a targeted reduction in its workforce by approximately positions to be completed by the end of february 
we expect to incur charges of approximately million in the first quarter in connection with this reduction in employment  and we expect to realize related employee compensation expense reductions and other discretionary spending reductions of approximately million annualized 
regulatory environment new rulemaking initiative 
in november  the department convened two new negotiated rulemaking teams related to title iv program integrity issues and foreign school issues 
the team addressing program integrity issues  which included representatives from various higher education constituencies  was unable to reach consensus on all of the rules addressed by that team 
accordingly  under the negotiated rulemaking protocol  the department was free to propose rules without regard to the tentative agreement reached concerning certain of the rules 
the final program integrity rules address numerous topics 
the most significant to our business are the following modification of the standards relating to the payment of incentive compensation to employees involved in learner recruitment and enrollment  including executive management  
table of contents implementation of standards for state authorization of institutions of higher education  and adoption of a definition of gainful employment for purposes of the requirement for title iv student financial aid that a program of study offered by a proprietary institution prepare learners for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
on june   the department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm with respect to the program integrity issues  other than the metrics for determining compliance with the gainful employment requirement 
on july   the department published a separate nprm with respect to the gainful employment metrics 
the department published final regulations on october   excluding significant sections related to gainful employment metrics which the department has indicated that it expects to publish in early calendar year most of the october  final rules  including some reporting and disclosure rules related to gainful employment  are effective july  although we cannot predict the form of the rules on the gainful employment metrics that ultimately may be adopted by the department following public comment  compliance with these rules could reduce enrollment  increase our cost of doing business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
refer to item a  risk factors  for further discussion 
in addition to the final program integrity rules  current rulemaking by the department of education has amended the return of funds regulations to require an institution to determine the amount of title iv program funds that a learner earned based on when the learner stopped participating in the course instead of when the learner withdrew from the course 
we anticipate this change may negatively impact our bad debt expense 
the amended regulation goes into effect on july  us congressional hearings 
in the last year  there has been increased focus by the us congress on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education 
on june   the education and labor committee of the us house of representatives held a hearing to examine the manner in which accrediting agencies review higher education institutions policies on credit hours and program length 
on june   the health  education  labor and pensions committee of the us senate help committee held the first in a series of hearings to examine the proprietary education sector 
the august  hearing included the presentation of a report by the government accountability office gao of its review of various aspects of the proprietary sector  including recruitment practices  educational quality  learner outcomes  the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste  fraud and abuse in federal student aid programs and the degree to which proprietary institution s revenue is composed of title iv and other federal funding sources 
following the august hearing  senator tom harkin requested a broad range of detailed information from proprietary institutions  including capella university 
on september   the help committee held a third hearing and senator harkin s staff released a memorandum entitled the return on the federal investment in for profit education debt without a diploma 
in december  senator harkin s staff released a memorandum entitled benefitting whom for profit education companies and the growth of military educational benefits 
we have been and intend to continue being responsive to the requests of the help committee 
any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or the eligibility of capella university or our learners to participate in title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our key financial results metrics revenues 
revenues consist principally of tuition  application fees  and commissions we earn from bookstore and publication sales 
during each of  and tuition represented approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the number of courses per learner  iii our degree and program mix  iv the number of programs and specializations we offer  v annual tuition adjustments  and vi the number of colloquia events and learners at each event 
enrollments for a particular time period are defined as the number of learners registered in a course on the last day of classes within that period 
we offer monthly start options for newly enrolled learners 
learners who start their program in the second or third month of a quarter transition to a quarterly schedule beginning in their second quarter 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing learners at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by graduations  withdrawals and inactive learners during the period 
inactive learners for a particular period include learners who are not registered in a class and  therefore  are not generating revenues for that period  but who have not withdrawn from capella university 
we believe that our enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings and learning experience  the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting efforts  the quality of our faculty  the number of programs and specializations we offer  the availability of federal and other funding  the length of our educational programs  the seasonality of our enrollments  general economic conditions  and the regulatory environment 

table of contents the following is a summary of our learners as of the last day of classes for the years ended december   and year ended december  doctoral master s bachelor s other total tuition and fees 
our tuition rates vary by type and length of program and by degree level  such as doctoral  master s or bachelor s 
for all learners in master s and bachelor s programs and for selected doctoral programs  tuition is charged on a per course basis 
prices per course ranged from  to  for the academic year the academic year that began in july and from  to  for the academic year the academic year that began in july 
the price of the course varies based upon the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
the majority of doctoral programs are priced at a fixed quarterly amount of  per learner for the academic year and  per learner for the academic year  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
for the academic year  our bachelor s program lower division courses are priced at per credit and upper division courses are priced at per credit 
for the academic year  lower division courses were priced at per credit and upper division courses were priced at per credit 
prior to this change  for the academic year all bachelor s courses were priced at per credit 
tuition increases have not historically been  and may not be in the future  consistent across our programs and specializations due to market conditions or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations 
capella university implemented a weighted average tuition increase of for the academic year 
based on prices from the academic year  we estimate that the average tuition for a typical learner is approximately  for a full four year bachelor s program  approximately  for a master s program  and approximately  for a doctoral program 
these estimated program costs will vary by learner based upon the program and specialization selected  the number of courses taken per quarter and the number of transfer credits earned at other institutions 
additionally  we offer scholarships and  under a variety of different programs  tuition discounts to members of the armed forces and in connection with our various corporate  healthcare  federal and educational marketing relationships 
other in the enrollment table above refers primarily to certificate seeking learners 
certificate programs generally consist of four courses  and the price of a course depends on the number of credit hours and the discipline 
prices per course in certificate programs generally ranged from  to  for the academic year and from  to  for the academic year 
a large portion of our learners rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in the years ended december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis were attributable to funds derived from title iv programs 
in addition to title iv funding  our learners receive financial aid from other governmental sources  tuition reimbursement from their employers or the department of defense or finance their education with their own funds or through private financing institutions 
costs and expenses 
we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services expenses  ii marketing and promotional expenses and iii general and administrative expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses are items of expense directly attributable to the educational services we provide our learners 
this expense category includes costs associated with core faculty  part time faculty  administrators  academic advisors  academic records  financial aid and other university services 
also included are expenses related to an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to providing educational services to our learners 
instructional pay for part time faculty varies across programs and is primarily dependent on the number of learners taught 

table of contents marketing and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current learners 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our marketing efforts  salaries and benefits for our sales personnel  brand spending  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
marketing and promotional expenses also include an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to marketing and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  new business development  finance  compliance and other corporate functions  together with an allocation of facility and human resources costs  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs attributable to such functions 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense and any charges associated with asset impairments 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest consists of sophia s minority owner s portion of sophia s losses 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  stock based compensation expense  other than temporary impairments  income taxes and noncontrolling interest 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
tuition revenue represented approximately   and of our revenues recognized for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
course tuition revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of instruction  which is generally from one and a half to three months 
if a learner withdraws or drops a course  we follow the university refund policy  which generally is percent refund through five days  percent refund from six to twelve days  and zero percent refund for the remainder of the period 
the refund policy varies slightly for learners within certain states due to state rules or regulations 
we do not recognize revenue for learners who enroll but never engage in the course room 
refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the learner withdraws from a course 
if a partial refund is given to a learner in accordance with the university refund policy  the portion of the revenue which has been earned by us is recognized over the remaining period of instruction 
colloquia tuition revenue is recognized over the length of the colloquia  which ranges from two days to two weeks 
deferred revenue in any period represents the excess of tuition and fees received as compared to tuition and fees recognized in revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our learners to make required payments 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts amount based on an analysis of the accounts receivable detail and historical write off experience  and current economic conditions  recoveries and trends 
in establishing our credit practices  we seek to strike an appropriate balance between prudent learner credit policies and learner retention 
accordingly  we periodically review and alter learner credit policies to achieve that objective by restricting or expanding the availability of credit we extend 
changes to credit practices may impact enrollments  revenues  accounts receivables  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
if changes in credit practices result in higher receivable balances  if the financial condition of our learners deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary  which will result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 

table of contents as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million respectively 
during   and  we recognized bad debt expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
contingencies 
we accrue for costs associated with contingencies including  but not limited to  regulatory compliance and legal matters when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
we base these accruals on management s estimate of such costs  which may vary from the ultimate cost and expenses associated with any such contingency 
stock based compensation 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values of the share award on the date of grant 
the fair value of our service based stock options was estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average fair value of options granted for the year ended december   the expected option life was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected option life for service based stock options 
beginning january   we believe that the use of our historical stock option exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior provides a more accurate estimate of expected option life and  consequently  a better estimate of fair value of our stock options 
therefore  the expected life of our options granted during the years ended december  and is based upon our historical stock option activity 
this change in estimate did not have a material impact on our operating income  net income or earnings per share and we do not expect this change in estimate to have a material impact in future periods 
our stock had not been publicly traded prior to november  therefore we did not have sufficient trading history on which to base our estimate of expected volatility 
the expected volatility assumptions for the year ended december  reflect a detailed evaluation of the stock prices of a peer group of public post secondary education companies for a period equal to the expected life of the options  starting from the date they went public 
beginning on january   we believe that the use of our historical stock price provides a more accurate estimate of expected volatility and  consequently  a better estimate of fair value of our stock options 
we considered the impact of implied volatility of the share price determined from the market prices of traded options  but determined it was unnecessary due to the low volume of publicly traded options and that publicly traded options do not include a variety of option terms to expiration that would allow the construction of a useful or accurate volatility curve 
therefore  the expected volatility assumption for the years ended december  and is based upon our own historical stock price 
this change in estimate did not have a material impact on our operating income  net income or earnings per share and we do not expect this change in estimate to have a material impact in future periods 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of regular dividend payments 
we have not historically and currently do not pay dividends 
in determining stock based compensation expense  significant management judgment and assumptions are required concerning such factors as expected term  expected volatility and forfeitures 
in our opinion  the assumptions that have the most significant affect on the fair value of our service based stock options and  therefore  share based compensation expense  are the expected life and expected volatility 
the following table illustrates how changes to the black scholes option pricing model assumptions would affect the weighted average fair values as of the grant date for grants made during fiscal year expected volatility expected life years 
table of contents as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
marketable securities other than temporary impairments 
available for sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices or other observable inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace for identical or similar assets  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly  and evaluates individual securities with fair values below amortized cost at the balance sheet date 
in order to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  management must conclude whether they intend to sell the impaired security and whether it is more likely than not that they will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management intends to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not they will be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss or impairments on securities management has the intent to sell before recovery are recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment on debt securities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other available for sale securities as a component of shareholders equity in other comprehensive income or loss 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method and compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets or other elements of the tax provision 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
the company is subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions 
currently  the state of minnesota has initiated an income tax audit for the years during  the company completed the income tax audit for the tax year with the internal revenue service irs and in january the company completed the employment tax audit with the irs 
for federal purposes  the statute of limitations remains open on tax years for state purposes  the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction  but is generally from to years and is also open for multiple earlier years for states that generated net operating losses 
the statute of limitations remains open on the earlier years for to years subsequent to the utilization of net operating losses 
we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company continues to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
the company recognized million  million  and thousand in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in september   the statute of limitations expired on federal issues related to tax year with no material impact on the unrecognized tax benefits 
in october   the statute of limitations will expire on state issues related to tax year with no material impact expected on the unrecognized tax benefits 
noncontrolling interest 
the equity interests in sophia not owned by the company are reported as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet of the company 
losses incurred by sophia were charged to the company and to the noncontrolling interest holder based on ownership percentage 
there is a put option within the sophia learning  llc agreement which permits the noncontrolling interest to put its shares to the company within a specified time period 
since these shares are outside the control of the company  the noncontrolling interest is considered contingently redeemable and thus is presented in mezzanine equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to 
table of contents authoritative guidance  if the value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest is less than fair market value  and it is probable that the contingency related to the put option will be met  then the carrying value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest must be adjusted to fair market value through a charge directly to retained earnings 
although the company has determined that it is probable that the put option will be exercised based upon the passage of time  the company determined that a charge to retained earnings was not needed at december   as the value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest approximated fair market value 
the company based this determination on the short time period from its latest investment in sophia and december  results of operations the following selected financial data table should be referenced in connection with a review of the discussion of our results of operations for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  in thousands change in thousands change of revenue change vs 
vs 
revenues costs and expenses instructional costs and services marketing and promotional general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate net income net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to capella education company revenues 
the increase in revenues in compared to was primarily driven by percentage points from increased enrollments and percentage points from tuition increases  partially offset by percentage points due to a larger proportion of master s and bachelor s learners  who generated less revenue per learner than our doctoral learners 
end of period enrollment increased percent in compared to tuition increases in generally ranged from to percent and were implemented during july instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to our ongoing investment in faculty and learner support as a result of increased enrollments and the need to support those enrollments 
there was also an increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of increased capital investments in and related to the learner experience and academic quality 
instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to scale of fixed costs and productivity gains across our faculty  academic administration  and learner support functions  lower facilities expenses as a result of scaling our fixed costs and the consolidation of all of our employees to one location in  and lower colloquia costs as a result of colloquia revenue growth slower than total revenue growth 
this decrease was partially offset by increased faculty expenses related to our adjunct faculty moving from independent contractor to employee status 
marketing and promotional expenses 
marketing and promotional expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in core marketing efforts and brand advertising focused on improving conversion rates and new enrollment growth and an increase in the cost per inquiry 

table of contents marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to prior year primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage from strong revenue growth as well as favorable conversion rates 
also contributing to the improvement were productivity gains in enrollment operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to increased spending on strategic business development  investments in portfolio strategy  and an increase in bonus expense 
in addition  expenses were paid related to a settlement of the patent infringement litigation initiated by digital vending services international inc  which was offset by a recognized gain from an unrelated settlement from one of our insurance carriers for recovery of expenses in prior periods 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to increased spending on strategic business development and investments in portfolio strategy 
these increases were offset by a decrease in one time compensation expenses  which resulted from severance recorded in the prior year and executive chairman fees paid in to our founding chief executive officer as part of his retirement transition

the increase in revenues in compared to was primarily driven by percentage points from increased enrollments and percentage points from tuition increases  partially offset by percentage points due to a larger proportion of master s and bachelor s learners  who generated less revenue per learner than our doctoral learners 
end of period enrollment increased percent in compared to tuition increases in generally ranged from percent to percent and were implemented during july instructional costs and services expenses 
our instructional costs and services expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to our ongoing investment in faculty including increased total faculty compensation to support higher enrollments  an increase in facilities expense as a result of co locating personnel into a single location  greater depreciation due to the erp system implementations in and an increase in colloquia expenses as a result of a greater number of events and registration growth 

table of contents our instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to scale of fixed costs and productivity gains across our learner support and university administration functions and lower information technology expenses as a result of fewer information technology projects related to instructional areas in compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in financial aid costs as a result of expanding learner services to twenty four hours per day and seven days per week 
marketing and promotional expenses 
our marketing and promotional expenses increased compared to prior year primarily driven by an increase in inquiry spend  increased information technology expenses as a result of a larger number of projects focused on obtaining greater marketing efficiencies and an increase in enrollment counselor staffing 
our marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to favorable inquiry pricing due to both current economic conditions and a shift in inquiry mix 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in information technology expense as a result of a larger number of projects focused on obtaining greater marketing efficiencies 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased compared to prior year due to increases in bad debt expense resulting from the economic environment and mix shift  an increase in bonus expense  an increase in headcount within our executive departments and increased investments in new business development 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained flat compared to prior year primarily attributable to higher bonus expense fully offset by scale within our finance department

quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and operating data each quarter during the years ended december  and the unaudited information reflects all adjustments  which include only normal and recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the information shown 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except for per share and enrollment data revenues operating income net income attributable to capella education company net income per common share attributable to capella education company basic diluted enrollment revenues operating income net income attributable to capella education company net income per common share attributable to capella education company basic diluted enrollment our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in enrollment 
learner population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations and learner attrition 
while the number of enrollments has typically grown in each sequential quarter over these periods  the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments has 
table of contents been the greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year  which corresponds with a traditional fall school start 
the larger relative increases in enrollments in the fourth quarter have resulted in larger sequential increases in revenue during the fourth quarter than in other quarters 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses does not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues  resulting in larger relative increases in operating income in the fourth quarter relative to increases between other quarters 
in addition  we typically implement tuition increases at the beginning of an academic year  which coincides with the start of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns 
in addition to our recurring seasonal patterns described above  our quarterly revenue is impacted by the timing of our colloquia tuition revenue  as evidenced in the fourth quarter of both and we typically have fourteen to sixteen colloquia per year 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended december   and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and respectively 
we maintain an unsecured million line of credit with wells fargo bank  which expires on july  the company expects the line of credit will be renewed upon expiration 
there have been no borrowings under this line of credit as of and for the years ended december  and any borrowings would bear interest at a rate of either libor plus or the bank s prime rate  at our discretion on the borrowing date 
in july  an unsecured letter of credit in the amount of million was issued under the million line of credit in favor of the department of education in connection with its annual review of student lending activities 
in july  the company increased the letter of credit from million to million to reflect the increase in the title iv return of funds in and regulations require that a company experience two consecutive annual title iv compliance audits with no findings to terminate a letter of credit 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements under title iv programs 
learners must apply for new loans and grants each academic year  which starts july loan funds are provided through the william d 
ford direct loan program in multiple disbursements for each academic year 
the disbursements are usually received by the start of the fourth week of the term 
these factors  together with the timing of our learners beginning their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
based on current market conditions and recent regulatory or legislative actions  we do not anticipate any significant disruptions in the availability of title iv funding for our learners 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if needed  to fund our operations or to fund strategic investments  we also believe that we could further supplement our liquidity position with debt 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of million and a million increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of greater capital expenditures in and the increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balance primarily driven by higher revenue partially offset by lower days sales outstanding and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of vendor invoices and payroll 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of invoice payments and an increase in accrued bonus expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in income taxes payable primarily related to increased state and federal estimated tax payments during and a million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to fewer learners pre paying for courses in than as a result of january courses starting a week later than january courses 
investing activities our cash provided by or used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and the sale and maturities of or investment in marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  investment in marketable securities at december  consisted of purchases  sales and maturities of tax exempt municipal securities 
net purchases of these securities were million during the year ended december  net sales and maturities of these securities were million during the year ended december  and net purchases of these securities were million during the years ended december  purchasing activity of marketable securities increased in over as a result of purchasing securities to fund a portfolio with an additional money manager 

table of contents we believe that the credit quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio as of december  is strong 
due to current market conditions  the unrealized gains and losses of the portfolio may remain volatile as changes in the general interest rate environment and supply demand fluctuations of the securities within our portfolio impact daily market valuations 
to mitigate the risk associated with this market volatility  we deploy a relatively conservative investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity 
but even with this approach  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments 
in addition  these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for some of the assets in our investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to facility build outs  data center and business continuity projects as well as investments focused on improving processes around learner financing  faculty  and our internal and external reporting and analytical tools 
we expect that our capital expenditures in will be approximately to percent of revenues and we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
we lease all of our facilities 
we expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the year ended december    and respectively 
financing activities during were primarily related to the repurchase of common stock in the amount of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from stock option exercises and million in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 
repurchases of common stock increased million in over contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms due in each of the periods presented payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases a total contractual obligations a minimum lease commitments for our headquarters  miscellaneous office equipment and software license agreements 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
regulation and oversight we are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental agencies and accrediting bodies 
in particular  the higher education act hea and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of education doe subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny on the basis of numerous standards that schools must satisfy to participate in title iv programs 
title iv compliance audit of capella university 
we perform periodic reviews and self audits of our compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements of the doe and state regulatory authorities 
we have not been notified by any of the various regulatory agencies of any significant noncompliance matters that would adversely impact our ability to participate in title iv programs  however  the office of inspector general oig of the doe has conducted a compliance audit of capella university 
the audit commenced on april  and we subsequently provided the oig with periodic information  responded to follow up inquiries and facilitated site visits and access to the company s records 
the oig completed its field work in january and the company received a draft audit report on august  capella university provided written comments on the draft audit report to the oig on september  on march   the oig s final report was issued to the acting chief operating officer coo for federal student aid fsa  which is responsible for primary oversight of the title iv funding programs 
we responded to the final report on april  in  we provided fsa staff with certain requested information for financial aid years through the fsa will subsequently issue final findings and requirements for capella university 
the fsa may take certain actions  including requiring that we refund certain federal student aid funds  requiring us to modify our title iv administration procedures  and or requiring us to pay fines or penalties 

table of contents based on the final audit report for the financial aid years through  the most significant potential financial exposure pertains to repayments to the doe that could be required if the fsa concludes that capella university did not properly calculate the amount of title iv funds required to be returned for learners that withdrew without providing an official notification of such withdrawal and without engaging in the course room prior to such withdrawal 
if the fsa determines that capella university improperly withheld any portion of these funds  capella university would be required to return the improperly withheld funds 
we and the oig have differing interpretations of the relevant regulations regarding what constitutes engagement in the unofficial withdrawal context 
as we interpret the engagement requirement  the company currently estimates that for the three year audit period  and for the subsequent aid years through  the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification and without engaging as required in the relevant regulations was approximately million including interest  but not including fines and penalties 
if this difference of interpretation is ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to us  then the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification would be greater than the amount we have currently estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    or there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 which is included in the codification under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
this update requires the disclosure of transfers between level and level of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the guidance also requires disclosures about the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and became effective for the company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or disclosures 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 receivables topic disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this asu is effective for disclosures as of the end of a reporting period for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  and for disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  the adoption of this guidance did not result in a material level of new disclosures 
we have reviewed and considered all recent accounting pronouncements and believe there are none that could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe the risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity 
in addition  all investments must have a minimum standard poor s rating of a minus or equivalent 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and were rated a minus or higher by at least one agency 
in addition  we utilize money managers who conduct initial and ongoing credit analysis on our investment portfolio to monitor and minimize the potential impact of market risk associated with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
in addition  unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 

table of contents interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities bearing a combination of fixed and variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows
