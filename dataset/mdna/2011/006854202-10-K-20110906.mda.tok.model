item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software  which are sold in combination with our own proprietary robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
our two most recent acquisitions have provided autonomous robot and fleet management capabilities that enhance our offerings for target markets  as well as unique gripping technology that expands our reach into the global food processing market 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to systems integrators  oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
we operate in two segments robotics and services and support 
recent acquisitions on january  we acquired inmotx  inc  a privately held provider of robotic platform solutions and gripping technology for the global food processing market  based in denmark  pursuant to a merger agreement dated january   under which we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock to inmotx shareholders 
all of the shares issued are subject to a holdback arrangement to secure the inmotx shareholder indemnity obligations for an eighteen month period following the closing 
adept also issued  shares of our common stock to the inmotx chief technology officer cto  to vest on the third anniversary of the merger  contingent upon his continued employment by adept or a subsidiary  subject to certain exceptions for acceleration for disability  termination without cause or termination for good reason or from a change of control 
we have also agreed to make certain contingent annual payments in cash to the former inmotx shareholders and to the cto founder in an amount equal to ten percent and two percent  respectively  of the revenues inmotx achieves in excess of specified thresholds during the three annual periods following the merger date 
the results of inmotx s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of inmotx 
on june   we acquired mobilerobots  inc  a privately held provider of autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies based in new hampshire  pursuant to a merger agreement dated june   under which we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock 
we also agreed to pay bonus amounts in cash up to an aggregate  to employees of mobilerobots if certain mobilerobots product revenue targets were met for fiscal based on the fiscal revenue results   of this bonus has been accrued and will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal no further bonuses will be paid pursuant to this merger agreement 
the results of mobilerobots operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of mobilerobots 
strategy our strategy focuses on a few specific industries where the use of automation is currently fast growing or is expected to grow over the long term and where we can provide significant product differentiation 
the industries we have targeted are packaging  medical  logistics  disk drive electronics and solar 
currently  we are focusing the majority of our investments on the global packaging market and the mobilerobots technology 
the 
table of contents packaging market has continued to provide new applications even during the last two years of worldwide economic weakness and has proven the strength of our quattro robot in this industry 
we believe our acquisition of inmotx in january further strengthens our offerings for the packaging market  as inmotx brings differentiated technology for global food processing applications 
we are also investing significantly in the mobilerobots technology to take advantage of emerging opportunities in the medical  logistics  and solar markets as it pertains to mobile technology 
for example  in the medical industry we have formed a partnership to be the exclusive provider of autonomous mobile robots to swisslog healthcare solutions for use in hospitals  labs and clinics to transport specimens  lab samples and pharmaceuticals 
in the solar market  we have achieved new design wins with solar cell manufacturers that we believe will provide significant opportunity for adept as these manufacturers begin to equip their automation capabilities and ramp up their production operations 
we hope to capitalize on the growing opportunities for automation in china with our office established during the year in shanghai 
this office will allow us more visible access and support to our growing customer base in the region 
additionally  we continue to address our sales efforts towards our traditional markets  such as the german automotive electronics and industrial markets  where our products are well positioned  demand is strengthening and we believe significant long term opportunity exists 
included in our growth strategy is an ongoing search for possible businesses  product lines or technologies for partnership or collaboration 
our focus is on pursuing partnerships that would broaden our solutions capabilities  further strengthen our position in key markets  increase our revenues and expand our operational scale 
trends in our business during fiscal  our revenues grew compared with the previous year  driven primarily by stronger demand from some of our traditional markets  including the automotive and industrial markets in germany  the consumer electronics market in asia and the worldwide market for replacement parts for adept robots 
revenue also increased due to the addition of new revenue from the acquired mobilerobots business and increased sales to the solar market in europe 
we are encouraged by our performance in our target markets and by the signs of returning demand from our traditional industries  which we believe generally indicate a more positive environment for capital spending going forward 
sales growth in fiscal was offset by a sharp slowdown in orders from the international disk drive market  as this industry entered a cyclical downturn in the second quarter of fiscal that continued through the fourth quarter 
while it is difficult to predict the timing of investment cycles within the disk drive industry  based on information from our customers  we believe this market will experience minimal growth through the first half of fiscal in addition  sales from the packaging and medical markets also decreased year to date  and the timing of orders in these markets continues to vary 
we believe that our acquisition of inmotx will help drive future growth in the packaging market over time  as the gripping technology that inmotx brings provides a unique advantage in certain vertical markets  such as hygienic packaging of meat and poultry 
on a geographic basis  our us sales increased in fiscal compared with the prior year and accounted for of total revenue in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
this growth was driven primarily by million of new revenue from the acquired mobilerobots business  as well as higher sales to the domestic disk drive  packaging  automotive and industrial markets 
this growth was partially offset by lower sales to the consumer electronics and medical markets 
we believe sales to the packaging and medical markets will comprise an increasing portion of our us business over time  and that our new mobile robotic technology will enable us to address new opportunities in the logistics  medical and consumer electronics markets  and our new gripper technology acquired from inmotx will enable us to expand our opportunities in the packaging solutions markets 
in asia  higher sales from the consumer electronics  replacement parts  and packaging markets in fiscal were more than offset by significantly lower disk drive sales  resulting in a revenue decrease compared to the prior year and accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
we believe that the packaging and solar markets in asia present us with significant long term opportunities over time  and our new office in china should help to capitalize on these opportunities 

table of contents european sales grew in fiscal compared with the previous year and accounted for of total revenues for fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the european growth was primarily the result of higher sales of both new and remanufactured products to the traditional automotive and industrial markets  particularly in germany  which increased year over year  higher sales of replacement parts for adept robots  and higher sales to the solar market 
this growth was partially offset by lower sales to the packaging market due to timing of orders 
much of the demand for our products in the last few years has come from europe and we believe the region will continue to be an important long term market for our products  both in traditional sectors such as automotive  electronics and industrial  and in our target growth markets  including packaging and solar 
restructuring and cost reduction actions operationally  from time to time we have undertaken restructuring and other cost reduction actions to support our financial model  which emphasizes cost efficiency balanced with investments in our products and revenue generating activities 
we remain committed to managing our business to generate cash 
during the second half of fiscal we implemented organizational improvements designed to reduce our ongoing costs  which included office consolidation  reorganization within our sales infrastructure and a general streamlining of our business operations in the americas region  and incurred  in related restructuring expenses  of which  was accelerated stock compensation expense 
summary of the fiscal fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  up from million for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of higher service revenues across some of our traditional markets  including the domestic and european automotive markets  and increased sales of replacement parts in europe and asia 
these increases were partially offset by an decrease in disk drive revenues primarily in malaysia 
the decrease in disk drive product sales was almost entirely offset by increased revenues in our industrial  automotive  and solar target markets  and the addition of new revenues from the acquired mobilerobots business 
gross margin was of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was favorably impacted by a higher margin product mix including less disk drive sales and a favorable euro rate along with increased sales in the european markets 
operating expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase primarily resulted from the addition of expenses for mobilerobots and inmotx  which primarily included salary and stock compensation 
operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared to operating loss of  for the fourth quarter of fiscal net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was million  or net loss per share  compared to net loss of million  or net loss per share  for the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the two year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal and  reflecting requirements applicable to adept as a smaller reporting company

robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal higher robotics revenues in fiscal were primarily the result of higher demand from the automotive and industrial  consumer electronics and solar markets  as well as million in new revenues from the acquired mobilerobots business  offset by decreased demand from the disk drive and packaging markets 
during fiscal sales to the automotive and industrial markets and the solar market increased million and million  respectively 
sales to the disk drive market in asia decreased million due to a cyclical slowdown in the industry  and sales to the global packaging market decreased million  primarily due to decreases in europe  partially offset by increased packaging sales in both the us and asia 
revenues in our services and support segment were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the increase during fiscal was primarily due to increased demand for replacement parts worldwide  which increased million  and increased demand from the automotive and industrial markets  primarily in germany  which increased million 
higher sales of replacement parts and higher demand from the automotive and industrial markets were partially offset by lower sales in the service and support disk drive markets  primarily in asia  which decreased million in fiscal

sales to the domestic industrial and automotive markets increased million in fiscal  and sales to the domestic disk drive and packaging markets increased million and million  respectively  while consumer electronic sales decreased million and medical sales decreased million 
our international revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal this increase resulted from a rise in european sales  offset by lower sales in asia and other countries 
european sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of a million increase in demand from the automotive and industrial markets  primarily in germany  a million increase in demand for replacement parts  and a million increase in demand from the solar markets  primarily in germany 
a decrease of million in the packaging markets partially offset these increases in europe 
sales in asia decreased to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in disk drive sales due to a cyclical downturn in the industry 
sales to the consumer electronics market in asia increased million  while packaging and replacement part sales increased million and million  respectively  partially offsetting the decrease in asian disk drive sales 
backlog 
our product backlog at june  was approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the increase in backlog at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal is due to increased capital investment by our customers 
customers who have placed orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal quarter are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual revenues for any period in the future 

table of contents gross margin the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was favorably affected by a more favorable mix of higher margin european markets and due to the strengthening in the euro to the us dollar exchange rate 
gross margin in fiscal was favorably affected by significant sales of our quattro robots  which have a margin that is higher than our corporate average  which was partially offset by higher sales of lower margin disk drive products 
fiscal gross margin was also negatively affected by the weakening of the euro against the us dollar during the period 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in sales mix of products and or changes in operating costs 
in particular  we expect that sales into the disk drive market will continue to have a negative impact on gross margin  while packaging  solar and mobile sales will have a positive effect 
in addition  we expect that changes in currency valuations will continue to impact gross margin  as a significant portion of our revenues are in euro and a portion of our components are paid for in japanese yen 
operating expenses research  development and engineering the following table sets forth our research  development and engineering expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products that are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  an increase of from million  or of revenues  in fiscal higher r d expenses in fiscal compared with the prior year  primarily resulted from the addition of expenses for the mobilerobots and inmotx businesses  as well as the reinstatement of employee salaries to pre fiscal levels commencing in fiscal  which were reduced as a result of the economic downturn during approximately the first half of fiscal we expect that quarterly r d expenses in fiscal will increase slightly from fiscal fourth quarter levels of million for that quarter  based on an increased level of product investment in our mobile and packaging products 
adept capitalized  of software costs in fiscal  compared to zero in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 
sg a expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  up from million  or of revenues  in fiscal higher sg a expenses in fiscal compared with the prior year primarily resulted from the addition of expenses for mobilerobots and inmotx  which was primarily comprised of salary and stock compensation  and the reinstatement of employee salaries throughout the entire fiscal period to pre fiscal levels 
we expect that quarterly fixed sg a expenses will increase modestly during fiscal from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of  reflecting both our increased investment in sales resources and marketing programs that support our strategy for growth 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization expense totaled  during fiscal for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the mobilerobots acquisition in the fourth quarter of and the inmotx acquisition in the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal no amortization expense was recorded in fiscal stock compensation expense 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for our stock option plans  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants 
stock compensation expense in fiscal includes  of accelerated stock compensation expense incurred in the third quarter of fiscal related to employee terminations that were part of our restructuring activities  and has been classified as restructuring expense 
excluding the restructuring related expense  the remaining increase is primarily due to the restricted stock issued in connection with our acquisition of mobilerobots and the fiscal grants and vesting of restricted stock based upon the level of performance for fiscal performance plan awards 
we did not record an income tax benefit for stock compensation expense in any of the periods presented because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
in fiscal  we expect stock compensation expense to decrease from fiscal levels due to the absence of the acceleration of acquisition related stock compensation expense which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal and partial vesting of the performance plan restricted stock awards  with no awards vesting under the fiscal performance plan 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock based compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal we recorded restructuring charges of  related to office consolidation  sales reorganization and business streamlining measures implemented during the second half of the fiscal year  which included  in accelerated stock compensation expense due to vesting and release of restricted stock in connection with employee terminations 
no restructuring expenses were recorded in fiscal 
table of contents operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal higher operating losses recorded in the fiscal periods were primarily the result of acquisition related expenses related to inmotx  increased overhead related to our acquisitions of inmotx and mobilerobots  restructuring charges  and the restoration of previously reduced salaries 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in fiscal  compared with interest income  net of interest expense  of  in fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal primarily resulted from a higher line of credit balance  which included borrowings late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the third quarter of fiscal to finance our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx 
foreign currency exchange gain loss 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction losses were  in fiscal and foreign currency transaction gains were  in fiscal during  most of our intercompany balances were deemed permanent capital investments in its subsidiaries and are no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal were primarily generated from realized losses from us dollars used to pay accounts payable in japanese yen  as the yen strengthened against the dollar during the period  and unrealized losses related to the revaluation of accounts receivable billed in us dollars and translated to euros 
in fiscal year  the us dollar denominated accounts in europe experienced gains due to the strengthening value of the us dollar 
these gains were offset by the losses resulting from yen denominated accounts in the us due to the strengthening value of the japanese yen 
as we conduct business on a global basis we are continually exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates  which can vary considerably from period to period 
the dollar euro and the dollar yen markets currently present the largest exchange rate risk for adept 
to protect our financial performance from the adverse effects of foreign currency fluctuations in the future  we are currently developing a hedging strategy to manage this risk 
we expect to implement this hedging strategy during fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
adept typically provides for income taxes during interim reporting periods based upon an estimate of our annual effective tax rate 
we also maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns as well as filings in foreign jurisdictions 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretations of statutes and regulations 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal for fiscal  the tax benefit represents state minimum tax requirements as well as a foreign tax expense adjustment primarily related to our singapore operations 
we have net operating losses that are sufficient to offset a significant portion of our domestic and foreign tax obligations  except when annual net operating loss limitations exist for domestic and foreign jurisdictions that result in some tax expense 
for fiscal  the tax benefit represents federal alternative minimum tax and state minimum tax requirements as well as foreign tax expense primarily related to our singapore operations 
liquidity and capital resources changes in the company s liquidity during the year ended june  primarily reflect the net effect of cash generated by operations  cash provided from the company s line of credit  capital expenditures and cash paid in connection with the acquisition of inmotx 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june  
table of contents in fiscal year  net cash generated by operations of  primarily resulted from a decrease of million in net accounts receivable due primarily to increased collection activity compared to fiscal year  and a decrease of million in inventory  partially offset by a decrease of million in net accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
other uses of cash from operations included the net loss for the year ended june  of million  which was partially offset by non cash items of million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
in fiscal year  the company used million of cash in investing activities  including million for the acquisition of inmotx and  for purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by  in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
in fiscal year  cash provided from financing activities primarily consisted of the million draw on the company s line of credit 
silicon valley bank line of credit we have a revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  or svb 
we originally entered into the loan and security agreement and related agreements for the revolving line in may in march  we entered into an amendment no 
to loan and security agreement with svb to amend the original loan and security agreement  as previously amended 
when we refer to the loan and security agreement  we refer to the agreement as amended 
we also entered into a new loan and security agreement ex im loan facility with svb and related agreements the ex im loan documents  pursuant to which a portion of the revolving line the ex im line is now guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states  and adept s potential borrowing base is expanded by enabling advances against foreign accounts receivable 
adept s maximum aggregate borrowing availability is million 
adept may borrow up to the lesser of million or of adept s eligible domestic accounts receivable  and up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base calculated by applying specified advance rates to adept s eligible foreign accounts receivable and inventory destined for export from the united states 
the loan documents specify the criteria for determining eligible domestic and foreign accounts receivable and eligible inventory destined for export 
adept may use up to million of the domestic borrowing availability for foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts with svb  cash management services  and letters of credit issued by svb to others for the company s account 
adept s available borrowing base under the revolving line is reduced by the principal balance of outstanding advances  the face amount of outstanding letters of credit  a reserve equal to of the us dollar equivalent of the face amount of letters of credit payable in foreign currency  of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts and amounts used for cash management services 
all borrowings bear interest at the prime rate announced from time to time by svb plus 
the maturity date for borrowings under the ex im line is march   and the maturity date for borrowings against domestic accounts receivable is march  adept s ability to make borrowings under the revolving line is subject to ongoing conditions precedent that our representations and warranties in the loan and security agreement are true  in all material respects  on the date on which we request the borrowing and on the funding date  and that svb determines  in its sole discretion  that there has been no material impairment in our business  results of operation  financial condition  or the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or any material adverse deviation from our most recent business plan submitted to svb 
adept and certain subsidiaries have granted svb a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets including certain shares of subsidiaries to secure the obligations outstanding under the revolving line 
adept must meet certain financial covenants under the loan documents  which require adept to maintain a liquidity domestic cash plus up to million of the domestic borrowing availability of at least million  and b minimum aggregate  rolling three month ebitda as defined in the loan and security agreement measured each month for that month plus the two preceding months  equal to or exceeding the amounts specified in the loan and security agreement 
the specified rolling three month ebitda amounts are minimum amounts for financial covenant purposes only  and do not represent projections of adept s financial results 

table of contents we also must remain in compliance with various other covenants 
for example  we must maintain our primary operating deposit accounts with svb  and require our us customers to transmit payments to a lockbox account at svb 
svb will transfer amounts collected from customers in the lockbox account to the company s designated deposit account at svb  unless our adjusted quick ratio the ratio of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus accounts receivable net of reserves  to current liabilities is below to  or there is any default under the loan documents  in which case svb will first apply collections from the lockbox account toward repayment of our obligations to svb  and then transfer any excess to svb s designated deposit account 
adept may not permit or suffer any specified change in control  including any change in the beneficial ownership of or more or or more  in the case of shares held by one specified stockholder group of adept s outstanding shares  without svb s consent 
various other covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  our ability to pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness or encumber our assets  the types of transactions including mergers and acquisitions we may enter into and our ability to transfer funds to subsidiaries 
adept became subject to additional covenants related to permissible use of proceeds and other matters in the ex im loan documents 
adept would be deemed to be in default under the loan documents if we failed to timely pay any amount owed to svb  if we failed to comply with specified financial and other covenants  including those listed above  if we otherwise materially breached  without cure  any of our representations under or other provisions in the loan documents  if there occurs a material adverse change in our or any guarantor subsidiary s business  operations or condition  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of svb s security interests or the value of svb s security interest in our or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or if svb determines there is a reasonable likelihood that we will not meet our financial covenants in the next succeeding quarter  if any involuntary lien or attachment is issued against adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or any judgment or order in excess of  is entered against adept or any guarantor subsidiary  that is not discharged  vacated or satisfied within ten days  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is generally not paying its debts as they become due  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary makes any material written misrepresentation to svb  if we fail to pay amounts due under or otherwise materially breach any agreements with third parties  or if a default occurs under such agreements which permits indebtedness in excess of  to be accelerated  if breaches occur under agreements related to subordinated debt that may be outstanding during the term of the loan  if there is any revocation or termination of  or nonperformance of any obligation or covenant under  any guaranty of adept s obligations  or if we lose government approvals or become subject to certain governmental actions that could materially adversely affect us 
in addition  if the export import bank s guarantee of the ex im line is declared void or revoked for any reason  whether or not caused by adept s actions  such event may trigger an event of default under the loan documents unless adept is able to repay all outstanding obligations under the ex im line and no other events of default are occurring simultaneously 
upon a default  svb may  among other things  cease making loans to adept  accelerate and declare all or any part of our obligations to be immediately due and payable  and enforce its security interest against the collateral 
adept was in compliance with the covenants of the amended loan and security agreement and the ex im loan documents as of june  at june   adept had an outstanding principal balance of million under the revolving line  which was borrowed in connection with the acquisitions of inmotx and mobilerobots  and bears interest at svb s announced prime rate plus 
based on operating needs  strategic activities and other factors  the company may further utilize the line of credit in the future 
in the third quarter of fiscal  adept incurred  in legal and bank fees to amend the line of credit facility 
we also agreed to pay a termination fee of  if the revolving line is terminated prior to its maturity date 
we must pay a fee  quarterly in arrears  equal to 
per annum of the average unused portion of the credit line 
during periods when there are outstanding balances of principal and interest under the revolving line  svb is entitled to charge a float charge  payable monthly  in an amount equal to one extra day of interest on each payment received by svb from adept during the month 
we must pay a collateral monitoring fee of per month if our adjusted quick ratio as defined above is less than to during the month  and 
table of contents there were outstanding balances of principal and interest or outstanding issued letters of credit during the month 
we also must pay a letter of credit fee of per annum of the us dollar equivalent face amount of issued letters of credit  and all other bank fees and expenses related to the loan transaction 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow  and if our projected revenue fails to increase or our operating or extraordinary expenses exceed current expectations  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  adequately respond to competitive pressures or fully execute our business plan 
we have limited cash resources  and though we are under no restrictions at this time regarding transferring cash from our foreign operations to our us operations  regulatory restrictions impeding our ability to transfer foreign cash reserves may occur in the future  and we may have limited access to a portion of those existing cash balances 
we depend on our credit facility and funds generated from operating activities to meet our operating requirements and execute our growth plan 
our credit facility subjects us to certain financial and operating covenants  the failure of which  or any default as described above  would prevent us from borrowing under this credit facility 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient capital on favorable terms  it could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities or make other investments in our growth  and could impact our business and results of operations 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  including capitalized software development costs  of million and million net of depreciation at june  and  respectively  and million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets net of amortization at june  and  respectively 
we acquired million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as part of the mobilerobots acquisition 
we acquired another million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the third quarter of fiscal as part of the acquisition of inmotx 
in addition  at june  we increased the mobilerobots purchase price allocation for goodwill by  to record a reduction in deferred tax assets related to the completion of the mobilerobots tax return filings for critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  
table of contents inventories  warranties  capitalization of software development costs  accounting for income taxes  foreign currency accounting  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers generally have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on our historical warranty experience and management s best estimate of our warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
our robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
we believe that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for our component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned refurbished robots and components 
we receive parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or we purchase surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on 
table of contents average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned refurbished or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within our services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not request collateral from our customers 
however  we may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on of consolidated accounts receivable 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at our discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with our approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states tax jurisdiction 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined using an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our us loss  among other considerations  provides negative evidence and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency accounting 
each of our non us subsidiaries uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions 
however  in order to protect our financial performance from the adverse effects of foreign currency fluctuations in the future  we are currently developing a hedging strategy to manage this risk  which we expect to implement during fiscal 
table of contents goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their economic lives 
goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lower projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units at the business unit level  one level below our reportable segments 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
future competitive  market and economic conditions could negatively impact key assumptions including our market capitalization or the carrying value of our net assets which could require us to realize an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  an impairment exists and is recorded 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as significant decreases in the market price  reductions in demand  lower projections of profitability  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of acquired assets  or significant negative industry or economic trends  indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition 
if this review indicates the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized by writing down the impaired asset to its fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
valuation of stock based awards 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
commitments and contingencies 
we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated
