item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  those described above under item a 
risk factors  and forward looking statements safe harbor below 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we are a leading provider of government outsourced services specializing in the management of correctional  detention and mental health  residential treatment and re entry facilities  and the provision of community based services and youth services in the united states  australia  south africa  the united kingdom and canada 
on august   we acquired cornell and as of january   our worldwide operations included the management and or ownership of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential treatment facilities including projects under development 
we operate a broad range of correctional 
table of contents and detention facilities including maximum  medium and minimum security prisons  immigration detention centers  minimum security detention centers  mental health  residential treatment and community based re entry facilities 
our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security  administrative  rehabilitation  education  health and food services  primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities 
our mental health and residential treatment services are operated through our wholly owned subsidiary geo care inc and involve partnering with governments to deliver quality care  innovative programming and active patient treatment primarily in privately operated state mental health care facilities 
our community based services  acquired from cornell and also operated through geo care  involve supervision of adult parolees and probationers and provide temporary housing  programming  employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community 
youth services  also acquired from cornell and operating under geo care  include residential  detention and shelter care and community based services along with rehabilitative  educational and treatment programs 
we develop new facilities based on contract awards  using our project development expertise and experiences to design facilities  construct and finance what we believe are state of the art facilities that maximize security and efficiency 
we also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted 
for the fiscal year ended january   we had consolidated revenues of billion and we maintained an average companywide facility occupancy rate of  excluding facilities that are either idle or under development 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
reserves for insurance losses the nature of our business exposes us to various types of third party legal claims  including  but not limited to  civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and or mistreatment  sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees  medical malpractice claims  product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims  claims relating to employment matters including  but not limited to  employment discrimination claims  union grievances and wage and hour claims  property loss claims  environmental claims  automobile liability claims  contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  electronic monitoring products  personnel or prisoners  including damages arising from a prisoner s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general 
table of contents types of claims  except for claims relating to employment matters  for which we carry no insurance 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
it is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale 
we currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policy for us detention corrections  geo care s community based services  geo care s youth services and bi  inc with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
a separate million limit applies to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services 
our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  inc  has a separate insurance program for their residential services division  with a specific loss limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate with respect to general liability and medical professional liability 
we are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including  workers compensation  environmental liability and automobile liability 
for most casualty insurance policies  we carry substantial deductibles or self insured retentions million per occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability  million per occurrence for workers compensation and million per occurrence for automobile liability 
in addition  certain of our facilities located in florida and other high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in california may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value 
with respect to our operations in south africa  the united kingdom and australia  we utilize a combination of locally procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the company 
our australian subsidiary is required to carry tail insurance on a general liability policy providing an extended reporting period through related to a discontinued contract 
of the reserves discussed above  our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers compensation and general liability claims 
these reserves are undiscounted and were million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
we use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities  claim development  payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards 
we also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process  including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim 
because we have high deductible insurance policies  the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable income 
additionally  we must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required  which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our 
table of contents operations and our effective tax rate 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
management has not made any significant changes to the way we account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements 
based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable earnings history  management currently expects full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances 
furthermore  tax positions taken by us may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes  potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed 
as such  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before income taxes  equity in earnings of affiliate  discontinued operations  and consolidated income from continuing operations would have decreased increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended january   january  and december  property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing assessments of the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
if the assessment indicates that assets will be used for a longer or shorter period than previously anticipated  the useful lives of the assets are revised  resulting in a change in estimate 
in our first fiscal quarter ended april   we completed a depreciation study on our owned correctional facilities 
based on the results of the depreciation study  we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our buildings from our historical estimate of years to a revised estimate of years  effective january  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of correctional and detention facilities 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
if a long lived asset is part of a group that includes other assets  the unit of accounting for the long lived asset is its group 
generally  we group our assets by facility for the purposes of considering whether any impairment exists 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
when considering the future cash flows of a facility  we make assumptions based on historical experience with our customers  terminal growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
while these estimates do not generally have a material impact on the impairment charges associated with managed only facilities  the sensitivity increases significantly when considering the impairment on facilities that are either owned or leased by us 
events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long lived assets such as the termination of a management contract 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
revenue recognition facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
a limited number of our contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets 
revenue based on the performance of certain 
table of contents targets is less than of our consolidated annual revenues 
these performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time 
such criteria includes our ability to achieve certain contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service we provide  non occurrence of certain disruptive events  effectiveness of our quality control programs and our responsiveness to customer requirements and concerns 
for the limited number of contracts where revenue is based on the performance of certain targets  revenue is either i recorded pro rata when revenue is fixed and determinable or ii recorded when the specified time period lapses 
in many instances  we are a party to more than one contract with a single entity 
in these instances  each contract is accounted for separately 
we have not recorded any revenue that is at risk due to future performance contingencies 
construction revenues are recognized from our contracts with certain customers to perform construction and design services project development services for various facilities 
in these instances  we act as the primary developer and subcontract with bonded national and or regional design build contractors 
these construction revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as the primary contractor  we are exposed to the various risks associated with construction  including the risk of cost overruns 
accordingly  we record our construction revenue on a gross basis and include the related cost of construction activities in operating expenses 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements for certain contracts where we provide project development services to our clients in addition to standard management services  we follow revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
this revenue recognition guidance related to multiple deliverables in an arrangement provides guidance on determining if separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units  how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
in instances where we provide these project development services and subsequent management services  generally  the arrangement results in no delivered elements at the onset of the agreement 
the elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and management services are performed 
project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract 
we can determine the fair value of the undelivered management services contract and therefore  the value of the project development deliverable  is determined using the residual method 
impact of future accounting pronouncements the following accounting standards have an implementation date subsequent to the fiscal year ended january  and as such  have not yet been adopted by us during the fiscal year ended january  in october  the fasb issued asu no 
which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
as a result of these amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated more frequently than under existing gaap 
the amendments  among other things  establish the selling price of a deliverable  replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method so that consideration would be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this amendment also significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple element arrangements 
this guidance will become effective for us 
table of contents prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
related to goodwill and intangible assets 
under current guidance  testing for goodwill impairment is a two step test 
when a goodwill impairment test is performed  an entity must assess whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value step 
if it does  an entity must perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of that impairment step 
the objective of asu no is to address circumstances in which entities have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this guidance modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts to require an entity to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists after considering certain qualitative characteristics  as described in this guidance 
this guidance will become effective for the company in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we currently do not have any reporting units with a zero or negative carrying value and we do not expect that the impact of this accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
also  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
related to financial statement disclosures for business combinations entered into after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the amendments in this guidance specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
these amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under current guidance for business combinations to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect that the impact of this accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors and those included in other portions of this report 
the discussion of our results of operations below excludes the results of discontinued operations reported in and for the purposes of the discussion below  means the weeks fiscal year ended january   means the week fiscal year ended january   and means the weeks fiscal year ended december  our fiscal quarters in the fiscal years discussed below are referred to as first quarter  second quarter  third quarter and fourth quarter 

table of contents versus revenues of revenue of revenue change change dollars in thousands us detention corrections international services geo care facility construction design total us detention corrections the increase in revenues for us detention corrections in compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of cornell in august which contributed additional revenues of million 
increases at other facilities in included i million from blackwater river correctional facility located in milton  florida which we completed the construction and began intake of inmates in october  and ii an aggregate increase of million due to pre diem rate increases and increases in population 
these increases were offset by i an aggregate decrease of million due to modest per diem reductions and lower populations at certain facilities  ii an aggregate decrease of million due to our terminated contracts at the mcfarland community correctional facility mcfarland in mcfarland  california  moore haven correctional facility moore haven in moore haven  florida  the jefferson county downtown jail jefferson county in beaumont  texas  newton county correctional center newton county in newton  texas  graceville correctional facility graceville in graceville  florida  south texas intermediate sanction facility south texas isf in houston  texas and bridgeport correctional center bridgeport in bridgeport  texas 
the number of compensated mandays in us detention corrections facilities increased by million to million mandays in from million mandays in due to the acquisition of cornell which resulted in an additional million mandays 
this increase in mandays was offset by a net decrease of million mandays related to the terminated contracts previously discussed 
we look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds 
the average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity 
the average occupancy in our us detention corrections facilities was of capacity in  excluding the terminated contracts discussed above and idle facilities 
the average occupancy in our us detention corrections facilities was in excluding idle facilities and taking into account the reclassification of our bronx community re entry center and our brooklyn community re entry center to geo care during international services revenues for our international services segment during increased significantly due to several factors 
our new management contract for the operation of the parklea correctional centre in sydney  australia parklea which started in the fourth fiscal quarter of contributed an increase in revenues for fiscal year of million 
our contract for the management of the harmondsworth immigration removal centre in london  england harmondsworth experienced an increase in revenues of million due to the activation of the bed expansion in july in addition  we experienced increases at other international facilities due to contractual increases linked to the inflationary index at some facilities and additional services provided at other facilities 
in the aggregate  these increases contributed revenues of million in fiscal year we also experienced an increase in revenues of million during fiscal year due to the fluctuation of foreign currencies 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in 
table of contents revenues of million related to our terminated contract for the operation of the melbourne custody centre in melbourne  australia

additionally  revenues from our operation of the columbia regional care center in columbia  south carolina  as a result of our acquisition of just care  inc  which we refer to as just care  in september  contributed an increase of million compared to these increases were offset by aggregate decreases of million at other geo care residential treatment services facilities 
these decreases were primarily the result of lower per diem rates and lower average daily populations 
in fourth quarter  we reclassified the bronx community re entry center and brooklyn community re entry center from us detention corrections to geo care 
the segment data has been revised for all periods presented to reflect the approach used by management to evaluate the performance of the business 
the number of compensated mandays for geo care increased by million to million mandays in from million mandays in primarily due to the acquisition of cornell 
the average occupancy at our geo care facilities was of capacity in  excluding idle facilities and taking into account the reclassification of our bronx community re entry center and our brooklyn community re entry center 
the average occupancy at our geo care facilities was in the decline in average occupancy is a result of the cornell acquisition 
we added community based facilities and youth services facilities which are occupancy sensitive 
in  the residential treatment facilities were primarily fixed fee arrangements 
facility construction design the decrease in revenues from the facility construction design segment in is primarily due to a decrease in construction activities at blackwater river correctional facility in milton  florida which resulted in a decrease in revenues of million 
the blackwater river correctional facility construction was completed in october and we began intake of inmates on october  in addition  there was million decrease at the florida civil commitment center fccc due to the completion of construction in second quarter operating expenses of segment of segment revenues revenues change change dollars in thousands us detention corrections international services geo care facility construction design total operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health and geo care facilities and expenses incurred in our facility construction design segment 
us detention corrections the increase in operating expenses for us detention corrections reflects the impact of our acquisition of cornell which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of million 
we also experienced increases to operating expenses due to the activation of new management contracts at d 
ray james correctional facility and 
table of contents blackwater river correctional facility 
certain of our other facilities also experienced increases in expenses associated with increases in populations and contract modifications resulting in additional services 
these increases were offset by decreases in expenses of approximately million as a result of terminated contracts at mcfarland  moore haven  jefferson county  graceville  newton county  south texas isf  bridgeport and fort worth 
international services expenses increased at all of our international subsidiaries consistent with the revenue increases and are slightly less as a percentage of segment revenues due to a decrease in start up costs in compared to the operating expenses associated with the new contracts in the united kingdom and australia for the operation of harmondsworth and parklea accounted for a combined increase over the fiscal year of million since these facilities were in operation for the entire year in changes in foreign currency translation rates contributed an increase in operating expenses of approximately million 
geo care operating expenses increased by million in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in operating expenses related to the acquisition of cornell 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million of operating expenses at the columbia regional care center in columbia  south carolina as a result of our acquisition of just care in fourth quarter facility construction design the decrease in operating expenses for facility construction design is primarily attributable to the completion of construction at blackwater river correctional facility in october which resulted in a decrease of million  and the completion of our expansion of fccc in second quarter which decreased operating expenses by million 
depreciation and amortization of segment of segment revenue revenue change change dollars in thousands us detention corrections international services geo care facility construction design total us detention corrections us detention corrections depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as a result of the tangible and intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of cornell 
in addition  the completion of the aurora ice processing center and the northwest detention center construction projects in q increased depreciation expense by million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation on existing facilities related to the depreciation study on our owned correctional facilities conducted in the first fiscal quarter of based on the results of the depreciation study  we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our buildings from our historical estimate of years to a revised estimate of years  effective january  for the fiscal year  the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million 

table of contents international services overall  depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly in the fiscal year over the fiscal year primarily due to our new management contracts for the operation of parklea and the harmondsworth expansion  as discussed above  and also from changes in the foreign exchange rates 
geo care the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for geo care in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year is primarily due to our acquisitions of just care and cornell which contributed increases to depreciation and amortization expense of million and million  respectively 
other unallocated operating expenses of revenue of revenue change change dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses comprise substantially all of our other unallocated operating expenses primarily including corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
these expenses increased significantly in compared to increases in general and administrative expenses of million are related to the general and administrative expenses of cornell from august  to january  the remaining increase is primarily the result of acquisition related expenses incurred for both the acquisitions of cornell and bi which resulted in nonrecurring charges of approximately million

the most significant increases to revenue were as follows i revenues increased million in total due to the activation of three new contracts in third and fourth quarter for the management of joe corley detention facility in conroe  texas  northeast new mexico detention facility in clayton  new mexico and maverick county detention facility in maverick  texas  ii revenues increased million in as a result of our opening of our rio grande detention center in laredo  texas in fourth quarter  iii revenues increased million as a result of the bed expansion of east mississippi corrections facility in meridian  mississippi  which was completed in october  iv revenues increased million at the robert a 
deyton detention facility in lovejoy  georgia as a result of the bed activation in january  v revenues increased million at the broward transition center due to an increase in per diem rates and population  vi we experienced an increase of revenues of million related to contract modifications and additional services at our south texas detention complex in pearsall  texas  vii approximately million of the increase is attributable to per diem increases  other contract modifications  award fees and population increases 
overall  we experienced slight increases over the week period ended december  related to the additional week in the week period ended january  these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues of million due to the termination of our management contract at the sanders estes unit in venus  texas  newton county correctional center in newton  texas  jefferson county downtown jail in beaumont  texas  fort worth community corrections facility in fort worth  texas  and the tri county justice detention center in ullin  illinois 

table of contents the number of compensated mandays in us detention corrections facilities increased by million to million mandays in from million mandays in due to the addition of new facilities and capacity increases 
we look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds 
the average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity 
the average occupancy in our us detention corrections facilities was of capacity in  excluding the terminated contract for tri county justice detention center which was terminated effective august the average occupancy in our us detention corrections facilities was in not taking into account the  beds activated in at four facilities in our us detention corrections segment 
international services revenues for our international services segment during increased over the prior year due to several reasons including i new contracts in australia and in the united kingdom for the management of the parklea correctional centre in sydney  australia and the harmondsworth immigration removal centre in london  england which contributed an incremental million and million of revenues  respectively  ii our contract in south africa for the management of kutama sinthumule correcional centre contributed an increase in revenues over the prior year of million mainly due to contractual increases linked to the south african inflationary index  and iii we also experienced an increase in revenues of million  in aggregate  at certain facilities managed by our australian subsidiary due to contractual increases linked to the inflationary index 
these increases were offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates for the australian dollar  south african rand and british pound 
these unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates resulted in a decrease of revenues over of million 
geo care the increase in revenues for geo care in compared to is primarily attributable to the revenues from our newly acquired contract for the management of columbia regional care center in columbia  south carolina which generated million of revenues 
we also experienced combined increases of million at south florida evaluation and treatment in miami  florida and treasure coast forensic treatment center in stuart  florida as a result of increases in populations 
these increases were offset by the loss of revenues from the termination of our management contract with the south florida evaluation and treatment center annex in july this contract generated million of revenues in facility construction design the increase in revenues from the facility construction design segment in compared to is mainly due to an increase of million related to the construction of blackwater river correctional facility  in milton  florida which commenced in first quarter this increase over the same period in the prior year was offset by decreases in construction activities at four facilities i the completion of construction for the south florida evaluation and treatment center in miami  florida in third quarter decreased revenues by million  ii the completion of construction of our northeast new mexico detention facility in clayton  new mexico in third quarter decreased revenues by million  iii the completion of florida civil commitment center in second quarter decreased revenues by million and iv the completion of graceville correctional facility in third quarter which decreased revenues by million 

table of contents operating expenses of segment of segment revenues revenues change change dollars in thousands us detention corrections international services geo care facility construction design total operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health and geo care facilities and expenses incurred in our facility construction design segment 
us detention corrections overall  operating expenses remained fairly consistent with fiscal with slight decreases as a percentage of revenues due to decreases in travel costs of million in fiscal the most significant increases to operating expense were related to new management contracts  new facility activations and increases in population from expansion beds which were activated during the fiscal year 
such projects include joe corley detention facility  northeast new mexico detention facility  maverick county detention facility  rio grande detention center  east mississippi corrections facility and robert a 
deyton detention facility 
these contracts contributed million of the increase to our operating expenses 
certain of our other facilities also experienced increases in expenses associated with increases in population and contract modifications resulting in additional services 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses as a result of facility closures for jefferson county downtown jail  newton county correctional center  fort worth community corrections facility  sanders estes unit and tri county justice detention center 
international services expenses increased at all of our international subsidiaries consistent with the revenue increases 
the costs associated with the new contracts in the united kingdom and australia accounted for a combined increase of million  including start up costs of million 
start up costs are non recurring costs for training  additional staffing requirements  overtime and other costs of transitioning a new management contract 
the increase in expenses in was significantly offset by the impact of foreign exchange currency rates 
overall  operating expenses for international services facilities increased slightly as a percentage of segment revenues in compared to mainly due to the start up costs in australia and the united kingdom 
geo care operating expenses for residential treatment increased million in as compared to the increase in expenses in was primarily due to our operations of columbia regional care center as a result of our acquisition of just care in fourth quarter 
we also experienced higher costs at florida civil commitment center due to start up costs associated with the transfer of patients into the new facility

generally  these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract 
additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions  other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes

we plan to fund all of our capital needs  including our capital expenditures  from cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and any other financings which our management and board of directors  in their discretion  may consummate 
currently  our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings from the million revolver 
our management believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements for disclosed in capital requirements above 
in addition to additional capital requirements which will be required relative to the acquisitions of cornell and bi  we are also in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for  the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
in that event  our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the existing senior credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs through and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms  or at all 
on february   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock which was effective through march  the stock repurchase program was implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities and exchange commission requirements 
the program also included repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and or vested stock options 
the stock repurchase program did not obligate us to purchase any specific amount of our common stock and could be suspended or extended at any time at our discretion 
during the fiscal year ended january   we completed the program and purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million using cash on hand and cash flow from operating activities 
also during the fiscal year ended january   we repurchased million shares of common stock from certain directors and executives for an aggregate cost of million 
in the future  our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital intensive projects will also be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes  the indenture governing the senior notes and our senior credit facility 
a substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and  as a result  on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital  a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues 
while we expect to be in compliance with its debt covenants  if these constraints were to intensify  our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our compliance with these debt covenants

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in was impacted by changes in balance sheet assets and liabilities such as the positive impact of the increase in deferred income tax liabilities of million partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
cash flow from operations was also impacted by the effect of certain significant non cash items such as positive impacts of depreciation and amortization expense of million and the write off of deferred financing fees of million associated with the termination of our third amended and restated credit agreement in third quarter the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of the additional amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of fixed assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of cornell

inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
please refer to item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k  the forward looking statements safe harbor  as well as the other disclosures contained in this annual report on form k  for further discussion on forward looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward looking statements 
with state and federal prison populations growing by approximately since  the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing us detention and correctional needs 
the number of state and federal prisoners housed in private facilities has increased by since the year with the federal government and states such as arizona  texas and florida accounting for a significant portion of the increase 
at year end  of the estimated million state and federal prisoners incarcerated in the united states were held in private facilities  up from in in addition to our strong positions in federal and state markets in the us  we believe we are the only publicly traded us correctional company with international operations 
with the existing operations in south africa  australia  and the united kingdom  we believe that our international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets 
we intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new customers and contracts  expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities 
we achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal  or rfp 
we primarily rely on the rfp process for organic growth in our us and international corrections operations as well as in geo care s operations 
we believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts 
our success in the rfp process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential 
in  we activated four new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of  additional beds 
this compares to the eight new or expansion projects activated in representing  new beds 
also in  we received awards for  beds out of the aggregate total of  beds awarded from governmental agencies under competitive bids during  including competitive contract re bids 
as of january   we have five facilities under various stages of development or pending commencement of operations which represent  beds 
in addition to pursuing organic growth through the rfp process  we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer 
we also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of government 
table of contents outsourced services that we provide 
we will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
the strategic acquisitions of cornell companies and bi incorporated have further diversified geo  creating a stronger company with a full continuum of care service platform and leading competitive positions in key market segments in the corrections  detention  and rehabilitation treatment services industry 
from the development of facilities  to the intake and housing of offenders  to the provision of transportation functions as well as comprehensive medical  mental health and rehabilitation services  to the reintegration and supervision of offenders in the community  we believe governmental clients are increasingly looking for full service  turnkey solutions that can deliver enhanced quality and cost savings across a comprehensive continuum of care 
following the completion of the cornell and bi acquisitions  we are positioned to provide complementary  full service continuum of care solutions for our numerous government clients 
revenue domestically  we continue to be encouraged by the number of opportunities that have recently developed in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities are two of the factors that have contributed to the opportunities for privatization 
however  these positive trends may in the future be impacted by government budgetary constraints 
recently  we have experienced a delay in cash receipts from california and other states may follow suit 
while improving economic conditions have helped lower the number of states reporting new fiscal year budget gaps and have dramatically increased the number of states reporting stable revenue outlooks for the remaining of fiscal year  several states still face ongoing budget shortfalls 
according to the national conference of state legislatures  fifteen states reported new gaps since fiscal year began with the sum of these budget imbalances totaling billion as of november additionally  states currently project budget gaps in fiscal year as a result of budgetary pressures  state correctional agencies may pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include the early release of inmates  changes to parole laws and sentencing guidelines  and reductions in per diem rates and or the scope of services provided by private operators 
these potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and or our ability to pursue new business opportunities 
additionally  if state budgetary constraints  as discussed above  persist or intensify  our state customers ability to pay us may be impaired and or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations  contract non renewals  and or contract re bids 
although we have historically had a relative high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring management contracts on favorable terms  or at all 
also  while we are pleased with our track record in re bid situations  we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations 
internationally  during the second half of fiscal year our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and australia began the operation and management under two new contracts with an aggregate of  beds 
in july  our subsidiary in the united kingdom referred to as the uk began operating the bed expansion at harmondsworth increasing the capacity of that facility to beds from beds 
we believe there are additional opportunities in the uk such as the uk government s solicitation of proposals for the management of five existing managed only prisons totaling approximately  beds 
additionally  we expect to compete on large scale transportation contracts in the uk where we have been short listed to submit proposals as part of a new venture we have formed with a large uk based fleet services company 
finally  the uk government had announced plans to develop five new  bed prisons to be financed  built and managed by the private sector 
geo had gone through the prequalification process for this procurement and had been invited to compete on these opportunities 
we are currently awaiting a revised timeline from the governmental agency in the uk so we may continue to pursue this project 
we are continuing to monitor this opportunity and  at this time  we believe the government in the uk is reviewing this plan to determine the best way to proceed 
in south africa  we have bid on projects for the design  construction and operation of four  bed 
table of contents prison projects totaling  beds 
requests for proposal were issued in december and we submitted our bids on the projects at the end of may the south african government has announced that it intends to complete its evaluation of four existing bids including ours by november no more than two prison projects can be awarded to any one bidder 
the new zealand government has also solicited expressions of interest for a new design  build  finance and management contract for a new correctional center for beds  and our geo australia subsidiary has been short listed for participation in this procurement 
we believe that additional opportunities will become available in international markets and we plan to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
with respect to our mental health  residential treatment  youth services and re entry services business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in connection with our merger with cornell in august and our acquisitions of bi in february  we have significantly expanded our operations by adding facilities and also the service offerings of geo care by adding electronic monitoring services and community re entry and immigration related supervision services 
through both organic growth and acquisitions  and subsequent to our acquisition of bi in february  we have been able to grow geo care s business to approximately  beds and  offenders under community supervision 
geo care has also recently signed a contract for the management and operation of the new bed montgomery county mental health treatment facility in texas  which is scheduled to open in march in addition  we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients 
labor and related cost represented of our operating expenses in the fiscal year additional significant operating expenses include food  utilities and inmate medical costs 
in  operating expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by the opening of any new facilities 
we also expect increases to depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue due to carrying costs we will incur for a newly constructed and expanded facility for which we have no corresponding management contract for the expansion beds and potential carrying costs of certain facilities we acquired from cornell with no corresponding management contract 
additionally  we will experience increases as a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of cornell and bi 
in addition to the factors discussed relative to our current operations  we expect to experience overall increases in operating expenses as a result of the acquisitions of cornell and bi 
as of january   our worldwide operations include the management and or ownership of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential treatment  youth services and community based facilities including projects under development 
see discussion below relative to synergies and cost savings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
excluding the impact of the merger with cornell  we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in to be generally consistent with our general and administrative expenses for in connection with our merger with cornell  we incurred approximately million in transaction costs  including million in debt extinguishment costs  during fiscal year ended in connection with our acquisition of bi  we incurred million of acquisition related costs during fiscal year and expect to incur between million and million in the first fiscal quarter of we expect business development costs to remain consistent as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential 
table of contents treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources from time to time on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets 
synergies and cost savings our management anticipates annual synergies of approximately million during the year following the completion of the merger with cornell and approximately million during the year following our acquisition of bi 
there may be potential to achieve additional synergies thereafter 
we believe any such additional synergies would be achieved primarily from greater operating efficiencies  capturing inherent economies of scale and leveraging corporate resources 
any synergies achieved should further enhance cash provided by operations and return on invested capital of the combined company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates with respect to our senior credit facility 
payments under the senior credit facility are indexed to a variable interest rate 
based on borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility of million net of discount of million and million in outstanding letters of credit  as of january  for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility  our total annual interest expense would increase by million 
in november  we executed three interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps  which have payment  expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the notes  effectively convert million of the notes into variable rate obligations 
under these interest rate swaps  we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to per year calculated on the notional million amount  while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three month libor plus a fixed margin of between and  also calculated on the notional million amount 
effective january   we executed a fourth swap agreement relative to a notional amount of million of our senior notes see note 
for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to our aggregate notional million of swap agreements relative to the senior notes  our annual interest expense would increase by million 

table of contents we have entered into certain interest rate swap arrangements for hedging purposes  fixing the interest rate on our australian non recourse debt to 
the difference between the floating rate and the swap rate on these instruments is recognized in interest expense within the respective entity 
because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical basis point change in the current interest rate would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  we invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments to provide a return 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these instruments are subject to interest rate risk  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the south african rand and the british pound currency exchange rates 
based upon our foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of january  with respect to our international operations  every percent change in historical currency rates would have a million effect on our financial position and a million impact on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
