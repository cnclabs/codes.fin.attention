item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent exploration and production company that utilizes seismic data  and other technologies for geophysical exploration and development of oil and gas wells in the cook inlet basin in south central alaska and the appalachian region of eastern tennessee 
occasionally  during times of excess capacity  we offer these services  on a contract basis  to third party customers primarily engaged in our core competency natural gas exploration and production 
currently  we are continuing to develop the acreage we acquired during fiscal and these acquisitions have grown our alaskan acreage position to approximately  acres of gross oil and gas leases and exploration license rights  net acres  which includes  acres under the susitna basin exploration license no 
and  acres under the susitna basin exploration license no 
also referred to as our north susitna exploration license 
we are continuing to assess and add strategic acreage to our alaska leases and licenses 
our tennessee leases consist of  acres  making our total gross acreage  acres 
during the year ended april   we began completion work on three alaska wells that were previously shut in  and we have completed work on two of these wells 
we capitalized approximately million of costs associated with those efforts 
in addition  we plan to recomplete eight previously shut in wells in the next three to six months 
our management is focusing the majority of its efforts on growing our company 
in addition to raising capital we are continuing to focus our short term efforts on two distinct areas increasing our overall oil and gas production through maintenance and repairs of nonperforming or underperforming oil and gas wells  and organically growing production through drilling for our own benefit on existing leases and under license rights  leveraging our  plus well log database and approximately  acres which are either under lease or part of the susitna basin exploration license  with a view towards retaining the majority of working interest in the new wells 
our ability to implement one or more of these goals in a timely manner has been greatly increased by our securing of a million credit facility with an initial borrowing base of million 
these funds will be used to rework certain wells  to drill new wells  and to purchase a custom drilling rig that we expect will allow us to bring our osprey offshore platform into full production 
as of june   two wells have been reworked on the platform by replacing their electronic submersible pumps 
the wells  ru and ru  are producing above the expected rates of bbls day 
as of june   the wells have averaged bbls day ru and bbls day ru 
during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal we had a number of significant accomplishments financing on december   we obtained a  line of credit from plainscapital bank that provided financial flexibility to us while we continued to seek longer term financing 
on june   we closed on a million credit facility with an initial availability of million with guggenheim corporate funding  llc  citibank  na  and bristol investment fund  ltd 
the plainscapital facility allowed us to stay on track with our development plans as we sought the larger  longer term facility 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the credit facility to satisfy the plainscapital line of credit in june land and development we entered into our performance bond agreement regarding the redoubt offshore assets with the alaska dnr  and received approval of cie s amended redoubt unit plan of development  which was approved on february   as well as approval of the redoubt redevelopment plan  which was approved march  this agreement and these approvals allowed us to restart the operation of our osprey offshore platform in march since the platform has come back online  we have successfully reworked two wells on it  substantially adding to our production in alaska 
in june we contracted with voorhees equipment and consulting  inc for the custom construction and purchase of a drilling rig for the osprey platform for million 
we expect the rig to be moved to arrive in alaska in september and become operational in november in june  we signed a five year lease for new office space for our corporate headquarters  and acquired a minority ownership interest in the entities that own the building that will be our new home 
this lease and acquisition should allow us to meet our demands for increased space for our growing team of employees 
we were the successful bidder on additional acreage in alaska that complements our current acreage  adding another  acres 
this acreage was awarded with an effective date of april  we were awarded our north susitna exploration license no 
 and along with leases won at auction  these new properties result in an increase of  acres in our gross acreage to  acres we secured a three year extension of the susitna basin exploration license no 
 which is comprised of  acres 
the terms of the extension require us to spend an aggregate of  over the next three years under a new work commitment 
this extension will allow us to identify the most valuable acres covered by the license and convert only the most promising prospects to leases at the expiration of the license 
we strategically assigned four leases with a total gross acreage of  acres to buccaneer alaska for total consideration of  as of june  we retained the overriding royalty interests in each lease including in the adl and adl leases and in the adl and adl leases 
if buccaneer alaska fails to drill at least one well on the leased acreage by  we will be entitled to a payment of  and may choose to cause buccaneer alaska to assign any of the leases to us that remain active 
settlement of disputes we settled two of our significant lawsuits  entering into a settlement agreement with petro capital iii  lp and petro capital advisors  llc and with prospect capital corporation  which resolved litigation that had been pending in federal court in texas 
the settlement agreement resulted in our issuing a total of  shares of our common stock to petro capital iii  lp and petro capital advisors  llc 
we also settled similar claims with prospect capital corporation 
we issued a total of  shares of our common stock to prospect capital corporation upon the cashless exercise of certain warrants 
in addition to the attorney fee savings and certainty that comes from the settlement and dismissal of the petro lawsuit and prospect claims  we have eliminated a substantial amount of the derivative liability that we had booked as a result of the anti dilution clause in the warrants at issue in this matter 
these warrants accounted for the majority of our long term derivative liability  and their elimination has contributed in a decrease in our total derivative liability from  at april  to  at april  on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with gunsight holdings  llc 
the lease in dispute in the lawsuit was declared to be in full force and effect  and we agreed to drill at least one well on the property subject to the lease each year for the next four years 
we reduced our transportation costs in alaska substantially by settling a tariff dispute 
on november   the regulatory commission of alaska accepted a settlement agreement between cie and the cook inlet pipe line company cipl 
cipl  a subsidiary of chevron pipeline co  operates a mile pipeline on the west side of cook inlet  and is the sole means by which cie can export its oil production 
this settlement reduced transportation costs for all cie production by per barrel to a rate of per barrel for the remainder of on february   we received a cash payment of approximately  pursuant to the true up mechanism in the settlement agreement 
cipl retained another  that was credited toward the costs of our future shipments 
corporate governance and leadership we moved the primary listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the new york stock exchange on april  on january  we added to our board of directors an experienced oil and gas accounting executive who has over years of accounting and financial experience with an emphasis in the oil and gas business  and we appointed him as chairman of our audit committee on march  we held our annual shareholders meeting for fiscal on march  at that meeting the current members of our board were re elected  we adopted a stock plan compliant with section m of the internal revenue code to allow us to deduct certain compensation under the exemption in that section  changed our name officially to miller energy resources  inc  and adjusted the quorum required for shareholders meetings going forward 
we entered into a revised employment agreement with our ceo  scott boruff  and a new employment agreement with our cfo  paul boyd  ensuring continuity in our management 
in early fiscal  we hired director david voyticky as our president 
along with founder  chairman of the board  and chief operating officer deloy miller and cie ceo david hall  we have assembled and retained a management team to lead us into our next phase of development 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal was a year of growth and development 
we recorded a loss of  for fiscal which compares to net income of  for fiscal as seen below  if you exclude interest income and expense  income tax expense and depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a from the numbers  fiscal shows this adjusted earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda to be a positive  as compared to an ebitda of  for fiscal revenues increased  between the years while costs and expenses increased  other income dropped significantly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as fiscal had large one time acquisition gains driving this total as compared to fiscal the major components of our consolidated statement of income for fiscal and are as follows for the year ended april  change revenues costs and expenses other income income tax benefit expense net income loss ebitda to assess the operating results of the company  the chief operating decision maker analyzes income loss before income taxes  interest income and expense  and depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
ebitda is not a gaap measure 
dd a and impairments are excluded from ebitda as a measure of operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations and that ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders 
ebitda  as defined by the company  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our ebitda should be considered in conjunction with net income loss and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
reconciliation of ebitda for fiscal and is as follows for the year ended april  net income loss add deduct interest income interest expense income tax expense benefits depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda the following table shows the components of our revenues for fiscal and  together with their percentages of total revenue in each year and percentage change on a year over year basis 
for the year ended april  change revenues oil sales natural gas sales other revenue total revenues oil and gas revenue represents revenues generated from the sale of oil and natural gas produced from the wells in which we have an ownership interest 
oil and gas revenue is recognized as income as production is extracted and sold 
we reported a increase in oil revenues for fiscal over the increase was primarily due to the addition of the alaskan oil well production during fiscal which accounted for revenues of approximately million for the year then ended 
in addition  we produced  mcf of gas in fiscal in alaska but we did not sell this as substantially all was used in our alaska oil production 
the increase in our oil and gas revenue from fiscal to was primarily due to increased production from the alaska acquisition as well as increased oil and gas prices 
for fiscal we sold  barrels of oil and sold at an average price of per barrel in alaska and we sold  barrels of oil at an average price of per barrel in tennessee 
we also produced  mcf of natural gas in alaska which we converted  mcf to electricity and used internally and banked  mcf for future use  and produced and sold  mcf in tennessee at an average of per mcf 
in we produced  barrels of oil and sold at an average price of per barrel in alaska and in tennessee 
we also produced  mcf of natural gas in alaska which we primarily converted to electricity and used internally and produced  and sold mcf and sold at per mcf in tennessee during fiscal other revenue represents revenues generated from contracts for plugging  drilling  maintenance and repair of third party wells as well as rental income we received for use of our alaska facility 
service and drilling income is recognized at the time it is both earned and we have a contractual right to receive the revenue 
our other revenue increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was impacted by a million increase in rental income 
in summary  our total revenues increased to  in fiscal as compared to fiscal if our efforts to turn non productive wells into productive wells and drill new wells reach our expectations  and the price of oil and gas does not drop significantly  we expect revenue to continue to increase in fiscal costs and expenses the following table shows the components of our direct costs and expenses for fiscal and percentages listed in the table reflect margins for each component of direct expenses and percentage change on a year over year basis for each component of other expenses 
for the year ended april  change costs and expenses oil and gas operating cost of other revenue general and administrative depletion  depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses oil and gas operating expenses increased approximately million or from fiscal to primarily due to costs associated with the alaska business we acquired in december expenses associated with the work on the alaska operation to return non productive wells to producing status increased approximately million between fiscal and fiscal and direct labor and contract services increased million and million  respectively  surface materials increased approximately million and pipeline expenses contributed another approximately million to this variance as well 
during fiscal  we expect to continue to turn more non productive wells to producing status and if that occurs  we expect these expenses will continue to rise  however  we are not able at this time to quantify the amount of any anticipated increase in expenses 
our central business activity is exploration and production and the cost of other revenue represents costs of services to third parties as a result of excess capacity  and are primarily derived from the direct labor costs of employees associated with these services  as well as costs associated with equipment  parts and repairs 
fiscal showed  for this component  up from  in fiscal during fiscal  we drilled three wells for ourselves and also entered into a contract with the us department of interior for plugging non company related abandoned wells located in the big south fork area in tennessee and kentucky 
during fiscal  we drilled wells for atlas energy  and in preparation for the atlas energy drilling contract we spent significant time and expense maintaining and repairing our drilling equipment in fiscal which contributed to the costs for that year general and administrative expense includes salaries  general overhead expenses  insurance costs  professional fees and consulting fees 
salaries were  for fiscal  which was an increase of  as compared to fiscal  and was primarily due to the increased staff in alaska 
professional fees were  for fiscal  which is an increase of  or due primarily to increased costs associated with the new acquisitions and onetime costs associated with a registration statement filed with the sec  as well as increases in investor relations and public relations expenses 
in addition  we incurred expenses of  in non cash items  which were recorded as compensation expense during fiscal  an increase of  or  from the non cash compensation amount recorded for fiscal of  these expenses were associated primarily with director and employee equity awards granted or vesting during the year 
this new layer of expense will continue in future periods and may increase as further development in alaska occurs 
as we continue to grow our business  particularly in alaska  we expect these general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in fiscal  however  we are unable at this time to quantify the amount of these expected increases 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from fiscal we capitalize costs of proved oil and gas properties and record depreciation  depletion and amortization provide on a pooled basis using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
during fiscal  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense was of total revenue  as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in expense for fiscal was the addition of wells and equipment as a result of the alaska business combination 
these non cash expenses will continue at this higher level as the alaska assets are being depleted over a range of to years 
as a result of these components  total costs and expenses were  which reflected an operating loss of  for fiscal this compares to an operating loss of  for fiscal other income expense the following table shows the components of certain of our other income and expenses for fiscal and percentages listed in the table reflect percentages of total revenue for each component of other expenses 
for the year ended april  of revenue of revenue interest expense  net of interest income loss on derivative securities other income expense  net nm gain on acquisitions nm total nm nm not meaningful interest expense  net of interest income decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal this was primarily due to non cash expenses in fiscal related to the fair value of warrants issued in connection with a prior financing transaction 
this was partially offset by fiscal interest expense associated with our convertible note program as these notes were issued during fiscal  but converted into equity during the fiscal year  as described more fully in other recent financing transactions further in this report 
our derivative liability fluctuates from period to period based on changes in the price of oil for our commodity derivative pricing as well as for changes in components of the black scholes pricing model including the company ending stock price  risk free rates  expected life terms  expected volatility and expected dividend rates for our outstanding warrants that have reset provisions 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded a non cash losses of  and  respectively  relating to the change in fair value of these derivative instruments 
the loss in fiscal was comprised of three transactions   warrants issued in the current and past years   warrants issued in an equity financing in march and  warrants issued pursuant to a consulting arrangement in march two of these transactions are no longer applicable at april   as we made a settlement on the  warrants  and the derivative language was removed from a consultant agreement related to the  warrants  so we only need value the  warrants program as of april  the application of this accounting treatment on our financial statements in future periods could likewise result in non cash gains or losses  which could be significant 
during fiscal  we recorded a gain on acquisitions of  this was primarily due from the alaskan acquisition as previously discussed 
during fiscal  we recorded a gain of  primarily related to approximately million of restricted cash  which we could not verify was ours until we entered into the performance bond agreement with the state of alaska on february  on march   cie entered into a performance bond agreement with the alaska dnr that applies to the offshore obligations under the assignment oversight agreement 
under the performance bond agreement  cie is required to post a total bond of million  however  the performance bond agreement also makes clear that approximately million held by the state will apply to the total bond required 
therefore  we recorded this event as a gain on acquisition for our alaska subsidiary 
we do not anticipate recording similar gains on acquisitions in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash 
we experienced operating losses for fiscal year and and had a working capital deficit as of april  we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we fully develop our operations following the acquisition of the alaskan assets 
although we expect an increase in our revenues to come from these development activities  we will continue depleting our cash resources to fund operating expenses until such time as we are able to significantly increase our revenues 
we may have to reduce our expansion efforts if we have not seen an increase in revenues over the next few months 
subsequent to year end we secured a million credit facility which we will utilize to further develop our alaskan subsidiary for off shore and on shore oil and gas wells 
we do not have any other external sources of working capital 
management believes that the credit facility  along with projected cash flow  are adequate to meet our funding needs for fiscal see loan commitment from financial institutions and guggenheim corporate funding  llc 
at april  we had a working capital deficit of  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at april  this decrease in capital surplus is primarily due to an increase in trade payables of  an increase in accrued expenses of  and an increase in notes payable of  partially offset by an increase in state tax credits receivable of  from april  to april   cash decreased from  to  this decrease was primarily due from an increase in cash used in investment activities of  partially offset by increases in cash provided by operations of  and cash provided by financing activities of  we presently have internal plans for capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal  million of this earmarked to restore production from our redoubt unit  including the purchase and construction of a drilling rig 
we anticipate we will draw on our million credit facility to access these cash needs 
we also believe we will have increased cash flow from our planned increased production 
however  if those avenues are not sufficient  we may be required to raise additional capital or change our capital expenditure plans 
as previously discussed  on november   cook inlet energy  llc entered into an assignment oversight agreement with the alaska dnr which set out certain terms under which the alaska dnr would approve the assignment of certain specified state oil and gas leases from pacific energy resources to cook inlet energy 
the agreement required cook inlet energy to obtain financing in the minimum amount of  to provide funds to be used for expenditures approved by the alaska dnr as part of cook inlet energy s plan of development 
we have subsequently provided these funds for the west mcarthur river facility using a portion of the proceeds of our capital raising efforts described elsewhere herein 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  this primarily reflects a gain on acquisitions of  and gains on derivative securities of  along with increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  which were partially offset by operating losses of  for fiscal net cash used by operating activities for fiscal was  this primarily reflects the cash paid for the operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expense in excess of revenues received for the period  which included the gain from the alaska transaction  but partially offset by the issuance of equity for services  compensation and financing costs of  net cash used in investing activities for fiscal of  is primarily due to additions to property and improvements of  and capital expenditures for oil and gas properties of  net cash used by investing activities for fiscal of  is primarily due to the cash we paid for the alaska assets of  and the purchase of oil and gas properties of  which were primarily costs associated with well startups 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal primarily reflects the exercise of equity rights for  and proceeds from borrowings of  which were partially offset payments on notes payable of  net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal primarily reflects the net cash received from the sale of stock of  proceeds received from borrowings of  a  decrease in restricted cash due to payoff of a bank financing  and cash acquired through acquisitions of  which was partially offset by payments on notes payable of  loan commitment from financial institutions and guggenheim corporate funding  llc on june   we entered into a loan agreement the loan agreement with guggenheim corporate funding  llc guggenheim  as administrative agent  arranger and lender and citibank  na and bristol investment fund as lenders

we expect to use the proceeds of the loans made under the credit facility to increase oil production both onshore and offshore in alaska through the drilling of new wells and the reworking of previously producing oil wells and for the purchase of a new drilling rig 
the first draws  totaling  have been used to pay fees associated with the transaction  such as attorney s fees  to pay off our line of credit with plainscapital bank  to make the first progress payment under the rig contract  and for working capital

in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
critical accounting general the preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis  and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable 
the critical accounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
policies involving the most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below 
impact of derivative accounting as a result of recent financing transactions we have entered into  our financial statements are impacted by the accounting effect of the application of derivative accounting 
the application of eitf determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to a company own stock  which was effective for our company in may  significantly affects the application of asc topic and asc topic for both freestanding and embedded derivative financial instruments in our financial statements 
generally  warrants  conversion features in debt  and similar terms that include full ratchet or reset provisions  which mean that the exercise or conversion price adjusts to pricing in subsequent sales or issuances  no longer meet the definition of indexed to a company own stock and are not exemption for equity classification provided in asc topic this means that instruments that were previously classified in equity are reclassified to liabilities and ongoing measurement under asc topic the amount of non cash gains or losses we record is based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the measurement date 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows are used in impairment tests of goodwill and other long lived assets 
these estimates are prepared as of year end by independent petroleum engineers and are updated internally at mid year 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of available data and is subject to engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of our drilling  testing and production after the date of these estimates may require future revisions  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  and all long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
accordingly  costs associated with the acquisition  drilling and equipping of successful exploratory wells are capitalized 
geological and geophysical costs  delay and surface rentals and drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling development wells are capitalized 
upon the sale or retirement of oil and gas properties  the cost thereof and the accumulated depreciation or depletion are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is credited or charged to operations 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties is provided on a pooled basis using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized by using total estimated units of proved reserves as the denominator 
all other costs are amortized using total estimated units of proved developed reserves 
fair value of financial instruments effective may   we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
this guidance establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or operating results  but did expand certain disclosures 
the fasb defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
additionally  the fasb requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
these inputs are prioritized below level observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data  which require the use of the reporting entity own assumptions 
cash and cash equivalents include money market securities and commercial paper and marketable securities representing certificates of deposits maturing in less than one year that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable 
these securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as level within the fair value hierarchy

we currently use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options
