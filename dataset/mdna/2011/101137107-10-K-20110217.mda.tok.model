item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report 
executive summary financial highlights and trends in  we generated net sales of billion  as compared to billion in  a decrease of million  or five percent 
foreign currency fluctuations contributed million to our net sales in  as compared to excluding the impact of foreign currency  our net sales decreased million  or five percent  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was attributable in part to the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd systems and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator crt d systems offered by our cardiac rhythm management crm division in the us  which we announced on march   after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the us food and drug administration fda 
we have since submitted the required documentation and  on april   we received clearance from the fda for certain of the manufacturing changes and immediately resumed distribution of our cognis crt d systems and teligen icd systems  which represent virtually all of our defibrillator implant volume in the us we returned earlier generations of these products to the us market on may   following required fda clearance 
we are working with our physician and patient customers to recapture market share lost as a result of the ship hold and have experienced better than expected recovery to date 
however  our us crm net sales decreased million in  as compared to our market share exiting  and we estimate that our us defibrillator market share decreased approximately basis points exiting  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to these product actions 
in addition  throughout we continued to experience competitive and other pricing pressures across our businesses and  particularly  on our drug eluting coronary stent system offerings 
net sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems decreased million in  as compared to  and we estimate that the average selling price of our drug eluting stent systems in the us decreased nine percent in  as compared to the prior year 
further  our net sales have been adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes  due to unemployment levels and other economic factors 
during  net sales from our endoscopy  urology women s health  and neuromodulation businesses increased million  or eight percent  as compared to  on the strength of new product introductions  increased sales investments and further expansion into international markets 
refer to the business and market overview and results of operations sections for more discussion of our net sales by division and region 
our reported net loss in was billion  or per share  and was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge related to our us crm reporting unit following the ship hold and product removal actions described above 
our reported results for included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related net charges  discrete tax items and amortization expense after tax of billion  or per share

our reported net loss in was billion  or per share 
our reported results for included intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related net charges  discrete tax items and amortization expense of billion after tax  or per share 
excluding these items  net income for was billion  or per share 
net income and net income per share that exclude certain items are not measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
see additional information for an explanation of management s use of these non gaap measures

cash generated by operating activities was million in and million in  and included approximately billion of litigation related net payments in  as compared to approximately million in  as well as the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment of million 
our cash generated by operations continues to be a significant source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth 
as of december   we had total debt of billion  cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of billion 
during  we completed the refinancing of the majority of our debt maturities  establishing a billion term loan and syndicating a new billion revolving credit facility  and prepaid in full our million loan from abbott and all million of our senior notes due in june further  in january  we paid at maturity million of our senior notes 
in  standard poor s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook 
in  fitch ratings upgraded our outlook to positive from stable  and moody s raised our liquidity rating to its highest level 
we believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio  our commitment to debt reduction  our improving financial fundamentals  and the progress we are making towards driving profitable sales growth 
recent events as part of our strategy  we are realigning our business portfolio through select divestitures and targeted acquisitions in order to reduce risk  optimize operational leverage and accelerate profitable  sustainable revenue growth  while preserving our ability to meet the needs of physicians and their patients 
we have recently announced several acquisitions targeting many of our priority growth areas  and  in january  closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation 

table of contents acquisitions we expect to continue to invest in our core franchises  and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in  and diversify into  priority growth areas including atrial fibrillation  autonomic modulation therapy  coronary artery disease  deep brain stimulation  diabetes obesity  endoluminal surgery  endoscopic pulmonary intervention  hypertension  peripheral vascular disease  structural heart disease  sudden cardiac arrest  and women s health 
in late and early  we announced the acquisitions of asthmatx  inc  sadra medical  inc  atritech  inc  and intelect medical  inc  targeting many of the above conditions and disease states 
each of these acquisitions is discussed in the business and market overview section below 
business divestiture in january  we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of billion in cash 
we received billion at closing  including an upfront payment of billion  and million which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions  and will receive an additional million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities  which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately months 
we will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement  and will also supply products to stryker 
these transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to months following the closing of the transaction  subject to extension 
due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business  the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation 
refer to note c divestitures and assets held for sale to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information 
business and market overview cardiac rhythm management crm our crm division develops  manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities 
worldwide net sales of these products of billion represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in our worldwide crm net sales decreased million  or ten percent  in  as compared to foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our crm net sales in  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our icd and crt d systems earlier in the year 
we experienced market share loss in the us as a result of these actions  however  we believe that our products  including our cognis crt d and teligen icd systems  among the world s smallest and thinnest high energy devices  will continue to be successful in the global market 
while we have recaptured a portion of our lost market share  the extent and timing of our recovery is difficult to predict 
we estimate that our us defibrillator market share exiting decreased approximately basis points  as compared to our market share exiting  due primarily to these product actions 
further  overall expectations of future crm market growth have declined  driven primarily by competitive and other pricing pressures  as well as fewer launches of market expanding technologies than previously anticipated 
we estimate that the worldwide crm market approximated billion in  representing a slight increase over the market size of billion 
in addition  physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidence based guidelines for icd implants and the us department of justice investigation into icd implants may have a negative impact on the crm market 
however  in september  we received fda approval for an exclusive expanded indication for use of our crt d systems with certain patients in earlier stages of heart failure 
we believe this indication could potentially create an opportunity to expand the worldwide crm market by approximately million to million over the next few years  and further enhance our position within that market 

table of contents the following are the components of our worldwide crm net sales year ended year ended in millions december  december  us international total us international total defibrillator systems pacemaker systems crm products our us crm net sales decreased million  or percent  in as compared to  driven primarily by the ship hold and product removal actions involving our icd and crt d systems  discussed above 
we are committed to advancing our technologies to strengthen our crm business 
in  we continued to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next generation line of defibrillators in the us in late or early  which include new features designed to improve functionality  diagnostic capability and ease of use 
due in part to anticipated changes to current fda regulatory requirements industry wide  which would increase the number of patients and length of time needed for certain clinical studies  we now expect to launch our next generation ingenio pacemaker system  which leverages the strength of our high voltage platform and will be compatible with our latitude patient management system  in the us in late or early  depending on final fda requirements 
refer to regulatory environment included in item of this annual report for more information 
our international crm net sales increased million  or less than one percent  in  as compared to international net sales of our defibrillator systems increased million  or three percent  in  as compared to  driven by strong market acceptance of our cognis crt d and teligen icd systems  and our recently launched site lead delivery system 
in addition  in july  we received ce mark approval for our latitude patient management system and have since launched this technology in the majority of our european markets 
the latitude technology  which is designed to enable physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes  is a key component of many of our crm systems 
in late  we received ce mark approval for our next generation line of defibrillators  incepta  energen and punctua  and plan to launch these products in our europe middle east africa emea region and certain inter continental countries in the first half of these products provide physicians and their patients with more options to customize therapy and enhance our market advantage in size  shape and longevity 
we also plan to launch our next generation ingenio pacemaker system in these regions in the second half of and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide crm market 
net sales from our crm products represent a significant source of our overall net sales 
therefore  increases or decreases in our crm net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the variables that may impact the size of the crm market and or our share of that market include  but are not limited to our ability to retain and attract key members of our crm sales force and other key crm personnel  our ability to recapture lost market share following the ship hold and product removal of our icd and crt d systems in the us  the impact of market and economic conditions on average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed  the ability of crm manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community  the referring physician community and prospective patients in crm technologies  future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors  our ability to successfully develop and launch next generation products and technology  
table of contents clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use  particularly in light of anticipated changes to current fda regulatory requirements industry wide  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  and new competitive launches 
coronary stent systems our coronary stent system offerings include the veriflex libert bare metal coronary stent system  designed to enhance deliverability and conformability  particularly in challenging lesions  as well as drug eluting coronary stent systems 
we are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy  which has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug eluting stent market 
we currently market our taxus paclitaxel eluting stent line  including our third generation taxus element stent system  launched in our emea region and certain inter continental countries during the second quarter of the ce mark approval for our taxus element stent system includes a specific indication for treatment in diabetic patients 
we also offer our everolimus eluting stent line  consisting of the promus stent system  currently supplied to us by abbott laboratories  and our next generation internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent system  the promus element stent system  which we launched in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in the fourth quarter of in september  we received ce mark approval for expanded indications for the use of our promus element stent system in diabetic and heart attack patients 
our element stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys  enhanced visibility and reduced recoil 
the innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution 
these product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation 
we expect to launch our taxus element stent system in the us to be commercialized as ion in mid and japan in late or early we expect to launch our promus element stent system in the us and japan in mid net sales of our coronary stent systems  including bare metal stent systems  of billion represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales in worldwide sales of these products decreased million  or percent  in  as compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contributed million to our coronary stent system net sales in  as compared to  net sales of these products decreased percent  as compared to the prior year 
despite continued competition and pricing pressures resulting in a decline in sales of these products  we maintained our leadership position in with an estimated percent share of the worldwide drug eluting stent market  as compared to percent in we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated billion in  consistent with the market size 
the size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention pci procedures performed  as well as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted  the number of devices used per procedure  average selling prices  and the drug eluting stent penetration rate a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures 

table of contents the following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales year ended year ended in millions december  december  us international total us international total taxus promus promus element drug eluting stent systems bare metal stent systems our us net sales of drug eluting stent systems decreased million  or percent  in  as compared to this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in our share of the us drug eluting stent market  as well as an overall decrease in the size of this market  resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures 
we estimate our share of the us drug eluting stent market approximated percent for the last five quarters  as compared to an average of percent during  and estimate that the average selling price of drug eluting stent systems in the us decreased approximately nine percent in  as compared to this decline was due primarily to lower sales of our taxus drug eluting stent systems  which we believe was due to customer perceptions of data from a single center  non double blinded  underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors 
we believe that average drug eluting stent penetration rates in the us were percent in  as compared to an average of percent during  which partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices on the size of the us drug eluting stent market 
we believe we have maintained our leadership position in this market due to the success of our two drug platform strategy and the breadth of our product offerings  including the industry s widest range of coronary stent sizes 
our international drug eluting stent system net sales decreased million  or eight percent  in  as compared to net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in japan decreased million  or percent  in  as compared to the prior year and our estimated share of the drug eluting stent market in japan declined to an average of percent in exiting at percent  as compared to an average of percent in exiting at percent 
we believe that aggressive pricing offered by market entrants and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain customers contributed to the decline in our market share in japan in  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by our first quarter launch of the promus stent system in japan  enabling us to begin the execution of our two drug platform strategy in this region 
our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our emea region decreased million  or eight percent in  as compared to  due primarily to declines in average selling prices  partially offset by increased penetration rates 
however  in the second quarter of  we launched our third generation taxus element stent system in our emea region and certain inter continental countries 
we believe that this launch  coupled with the november launch of our promus element stent system  which has quickly gained market share  exiting with approximately one quarter share of the drug eluting stent market in emea  position us well in this market going forward 
net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our inter continental region increased million  or five percent  driven by an increase in penetration rates and procedural volume 
we market the promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  a private labeled xience v stent system supplied to us by abbott laboratories 
as of the closing of abbott s acquisition of guidant corporation s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  we obtained a perpetual license to the intellectual property used in guidant s drug eluting stent system program purchased by abbott 
we believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position 
however  under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott  including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved fda pre market approval  is significantly lower than that of our taxus and promus element stent systems 
specifically  the promus stent system has operating profit margins that approximate half of our taxus stent system operating profit margin 
therefore  if sales of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to 
table of contents us by abbott increase in relation to our total drug eluting stent system sales  our profit margins will decrease 
refer to our gross profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins 
our internally developed and manufactured promus element everolimus eluting stent system  launched in our emea region and certain inter continental countries in the fourth quarter of  generates gross profit margins more favorable than the promus stent system and we expect will positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions as sales shift from promus to promus element 
further  the price we pay for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from abbott is determined by contracts with abbott and is based  in part  on previously fixed estimates of abbott s manufacturing costs for everolimus eluting stent systems and third party reports of our average selling price of these stent systems 
amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on abbott s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott 
our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process 
we are currently reliant on abbott for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems in the us and japan 
our supply agreement with abbott for everolimus eluting stent systems in the us and japan extends through the end of the second quarter of at present  we believe that our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from abbott  coupled with our current launch plans for our internally developed and manufactured promus element everolimus eluting stent system  is sufficient to meet customer demand 
however  any production or capacity issues that affect abbott s manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting  ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner  therefore  our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by abbott may not align with customer demand  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
further  a delay in the launch of our internally developed and manufactured promus element everolimus eluting stent system in the us and japan  currently expected in mid  could result in an inability to meet customer demand for everolimus eluting stent systems 
historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  our competitors or third parties  or the market s perception of these clinical data  may adversely impact our position in  and share of  the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
we believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons  including our two drug platform strategy  including specialty stent sizes  the broad and consistent long term results of our taxus clinical trials  and the favorable results of the xience v promus and promus element stent system clinical trials to date  the performance benefits of our current and future technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products  including our promus element and taxus element stent systems  in additional geographies  our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force  and the strength of our clinical  selling  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 

table of contents however  a decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include  but are not limited to the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems available in the market  the impact and outcomes of on going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors products  including those trials sponsored by our competitors  or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products  physician and patient confidence in our current and next generation technology  our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology features  including the promus element and taxus element stent systems in additional geographies  changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates  the overall number of pci procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  new competitive product launches  and the outcome of intellectual property litigation 
during and early  we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters  including multiple matters with johnson johnson  all outstanding litigation between us and medtronic  inc with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases  and all outstanding litigation between us and bruce saffran  md  md however  there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market 
in particular  although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with johnson johnson  we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them  particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems in addition to coronary stent systems  our interventional cardiology business markets balloon catheters  rotational atherectomy systems  guide wires  guide catheters  embolic protection devices  and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca procedures  as well as ultrasound imaging systems 
our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or five percent 
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which contributed million to our interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems net sales in  as compared to the prior year  net sales of these products decreased million  or six percent 
our us net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million in our international net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions  pricing pressures and competitive product launches 
we continue to hold a strong leadership position in the ptca balloon catheter market  maintaining an estimated percent average share of the us market and percent worldwide in we have executed and are planning a number of additional new product launches during  including the full launch of our apex pre dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity  launched in limited markets during the second quarter of in june  we launched the nc quantum apex post dilatation balloon catheter  developed specifically to address physicians needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment  which has been received positively in the market 
in addition  we began a phased launch of our kinetix family of guidewires in the us  our emea region and certain inter continental countries in april 
table of contents as part of our strategic plan  we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in  and diversify into  other areas and disease states  including structural heart 
in january  we completed the acquisition of sadra medical  inc sadra is developing a repositionable and retrievable device for percutaneous aortic valve replacement pavr to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis and recently completed a series of european feasibility studies for its lotus valve system  which consists of a stent mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve 
the low profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning  repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant 
pavr is one of the fastest growing medical device markets 
peripheral interventions our peripheral interventions business product offerings include stents  balloon catheters  sheaths  wires and vena cava filters  which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease  and we continue to hold the number one position in the worldwide peripheral interventions market 
our worldwide net sales of these products increased to million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million  or one percent 
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contributed million to our peripheral interventions net sales in  as compared the prior year  net sales of these products increased million  or less than one percent  as compared to our us net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million for the prior year 
our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in  driven by several international product launches  including the second quarter launch in japan of our carotid wallstent monorail endoprosthesis 
we look forward to new product launches  including our next generation percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon  expected in the second half of and believe that these launches  coupled with the strength of our express sd renal monorail premounted stent system  our express ld stent system  which received fda approval in the first quarter of for an iliac indication  our sterling monorail and over the wire balloon dilatation catheter and our extensive line of interventional oncology product solutions  will continue to position us well in the growing peripheral interventions market 
electrophysiology we develop less invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart 
our leading products include the blazer line of ablation catheters  including our next generation blazer prime ablation catheter  designed to deliver enhanced performance  responsiveness and durability  which we launched in the us in the fourth quarter of worldwide net sales of our electrophysiology products decreased to million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or two percent  due principally to product availability constraints with our chilli ii catheter line 
foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our electrophysiology net sales in  as compared to the prior year 
our us net sales of these products were million  as compared to million for the prior year  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in we have begun a limited launch of our blazer prime ablation catheter in the us  our emea region and certain inter continental countries  and believe that with the increasing adoption of this technology and other upcoming product launches  we are well positioned within the electrophysiology market 
as part of our strategic plan  we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in  and diversify into  other areas and disease states  including atrial fibrillation 
in january  we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire atritech  inc  subject to customary closing conditions 
atritech has developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke 
the watchman left atrial appendage closure technology  developed by atritech  is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs  and is approved for use in ce mark countries 
endoscopy our endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems 
our worldwide net sales of these products increased to billion in  as compared to billion in  an increase of million  or seven percent 

table of contents excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contributed million to our endoscopy net sales in  as compared to the prior year  net sales of these products increased million  or six percent  as compared to our us net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million for the prior year  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in these increases were due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise  driven by the continued commercialization and adoption of our wallflex family of stents  in particular  the wallflex biliary line and wallflex esophageal line 
in addition  our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our resolution clip device  an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding  and our biliary franchise drove solid growth on the strength of our rapid exchange biliary devices 
during  we introduced expanded sizes of our radial jaw biopsy forceps  and have launched a number of new products targeting the biliary interventional market 
as part of our strategic plan  we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in  and diversify into  other areas and disease states  including endoscopic pulmonary intervention 
on october   we completed our acquisition of asthmatx  inc asthmatx designs  manufactures and markets a less invasive  catheter based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma 
the alair bronchial thermoplasty system  developed by asthmatx  has both ce mark and fda approval and is the first device based asthma treatment approved by the fda 
we expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to the mid to long term growth and diversification of the endoscopy business 
urology women s health our urology women s health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders 
our worldwide net sales of these products increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or five percent 
foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our urology women s health net sales in  as compared to the prior year 
our us net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million in  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million for the prior year 
these increases were driven by new product introductions and increased sales investments 
in  we plan to expand the launch of our recently approved genesys hydro thermablator hta system  a next generation endometrial ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia 
the genesys hta system features a smaller and lighter console  simplified set up requirements  and an enhanced graphic user interface and is designed to improve operating performance 
we believe this new product offering will enable us to increase our share of this market 
neuromodulation within our neuromodulation business  we market the precision spinal cord stimulation scs system  used for the management of chronic pain 
our worldwide net sales of neuromodulation products increased to million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million  or seven percent 
foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our neuromodulation net sales in  as compared to the prior year 
our us net sales of these products were million in as compared to million for the prior year  and our international net sales of these products were million in  as compared to million in  driven by an increase in procedural volume and new product launches 
in  we received fda approval and launched two lead splitters  as well as the linear and linear percutaneous leads for use with our scs systems  offering a broader range of lead configurations and designed to provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients 
these represent the broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry 
we believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as multiple independent current control  which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely  and are involved in various studies designed to evaluate the use of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of additional sources of pain 
as a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation  we have initiated a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome 
we believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care 
in addition  in late we initiated a european clinical trial for the treatment of parkinson s disease using our vercise deep brain stimulation system  and  in january  we completed the 
table of contents acquisition of intelect medical  inc  a development stage company developing advanced visualization and programming for the vercise system 
we believe this acquisition leverages the core architecture of our vercise platform and advances the field of deep brain stimulation 
neurovascular in january  we closed the sale our neurovascular business to stryker corporation 
we will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement  and will also supply products to stryker 
these transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to months following the closing of the transaction  subject to extension  and we will recognize net sales on the sale of neurovascular products in certain countries during this period 
our future sales of neurovascular products to stryker will be significantly lower than our neurovascular net sales and will be at significantly reduced gross margins 
the neurovascular business markets a broad line of coated and uncoated detachable coils  micro delivery stents  micro guidewires  micro catheters  guiding catheters and embolics to neuro interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons to treat diseases of the neurovascular system 
our worldwide net sales of neurovascular products decreased to million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or two percent 
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contributed million to neurovascular net sales in  as compared to the prior year  net sales of these products decreased million  or four percent  in  as compared to our us net sales of these products were million  as compared to million for the prior year  and our international net sales were million in  as compared to million in these decreases resulted primarily from new competitive launches and a delay in the launch of the next generation family of detachable coils  as well the impact of a field action initiated during the third quarter with respect to selective lots of the matrix detachable coil 
however  in october  we received fda approval for the next generation family of detachable coils  which includes an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times and began a phased launch of the product in in  we also launched the neuroform ez stent system  the fourth generation intracranial aneurysm stent system designed for use in conjunction with endovascular coiling to treat wide necked aneurysms  in the us and our emea region 
fda matters in january  we received a corporate warning letter from the fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
we identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the fda and implemented those solutions throughout our organization 
during  the fda reinspected a number of our facilities and  in october  informed us that our quality system was in substantial compliance with its quality system regulations 
in november and january  the fda reinspected two of our sites to follow up on observations from the fda inspections 
both of these fda inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter were removed 
on august   we were notified by the fda that the corporate warning letter had been lifted 
in august  the fda released numerous draft proposals on the k process aimed at increasing transparency and streamlining the process  while adding more scientific rigor to the review process 
in january  the fda released the implementation plan for changes to the k submission program  which includes additional training of fda staff  the creation of various guidance documents intended to provide greater clarity to certain processes  as well as various internal changes to the fda s procedures 
we have a portfolio of products that includes numerous class ii medical devices 
several of the fda s proposals could increase the regulatory burden on our industry  including those that could increase the cost  complexity and time to market for certain high risk class ii medical devices 
restructuring initiatives we are a diversified worldwide medical device leader and hold number one or two positions in the majority of the markets in which we compete 
since our inception  we have generated significant revenue growth driven by product innovation  strategic acquisitions and robust investments in research and development 
we generate 
table of contents strong cash flow  which has enabled us to reduce our debt obligations and further invest in our growth 
on an on going basis  we monitor the dynamics of the economy  the healthcare industry  and the markets in which we compete  and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency  and better alignment of expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects  capital and our people that are essential to our long term success 
as a result of these assessments  we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long term success 
these initiatives are described below  and additional information can be found in results of operations and note i restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
restructuring plan on february   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the restructuring plan designed to focus our business  drive innovation  accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value 
key activities under the plan include the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses  as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions  the centralization of our research and development organization  the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets  and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio 
we estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately million to million  once completed in we expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business 
activities under the restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of we expect the execution of the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately  to  positions worldwide 
plant network optimization in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program is a complement to our restructuring plan  discussed below  and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
we estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting these savings are in addition to the estimated million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our restructuring plan  discussed below 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of restructuring plan in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan the restructuring plan 
the plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value 
key activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses  corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources  strengthen competitive positions  and create a more simplified and efficient business model  the elimination  suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects  and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities 
the execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately million exiting we have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases  primarily in customer facing positions 
in addition  we expect reductions of annualized run rate manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting as a result of transfers of certain production lines 
due to the longer term nature of these initiatives  we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until we initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of the transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the restructuring plan was completed as of december   all other major 
table of contents activities under the plan  with the exception of final production line transfers  were completed as of december  healthcare reform the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in certain provisions of the legislation will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood  and it is unclear what the full impact will be from the legislation 
the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a percent excise tax on us sales of class i  ii and iii medical devices beginning in us net sales represented percent of our worldwide net sales in and  therefore  this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
other provisions of this legislation  including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs  comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies  could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
further  we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 
however  any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
results of operations net sales we manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis  and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level 
management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance 
to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange  we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to us dollars using current period currency exchange rates 
the regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in note p segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
as of december   we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions the united states  emea  consisting of europe  the middle east and africa  japan  and inter continental  consisting of our asia pacific and the americas operating segments 
the reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment

in addition  us net sales of our interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems business decreased million in  as compared to the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of us net sales in from our endoscopy business of million  million attributable to our urology women s health business  and million of growth in our neuromodulation 
table of contents business  as compared to refer to the business and market overview section for further discussion of our net sales 
during  our us net sales increased million  or four percent  as compared to the increase was driven primarily by an increase in us crm net sales of million and an increase of million in us net sales of our coronary stent systems 
in addition  us net sales in from our endoscopy business grew million  our urology women s health net sales increased million  and our neuromodulation division increased us net sales million in  as compared to these increases were partially offset by declines in us net sales from our interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems business of million and a decrease of million in peripheral interventions us net sales in  as compared to the prior year

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  net sales in our emea region decreased million  or one percent  in  as compared the prior year 
our net sales in japan decreased million  or eight percent  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in  as compared to  due primarily to competitive launches of drug eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug eluting stent system customers  as well as reductions in average selling prices 
net sales in our inter continental region  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  increased million  or one percent  in  as compared to the prior year 
refer to the business and market overview section for further discussion of our net sales 
during  our international net sales increased million  or less than one percent  as compared to foreign currency fluctuations contributed a negative million to our international net sales  as compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  net sales in our emea region increased million  or one percent  in  as compared to our net sales in japan increased million  or four percent  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in  as compared to  due primarily to an increase in coronary stent system sales following the launch of our second generation taxus libert stent system in that region 
net sales in our inter continental region increased million  or eight percent  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  in  as compared to the prior year 
gross profit our gross profit was billion in  billion in  and billion in as a percentage of net sales  our gross profit decreased to percent in  as compared to percent in and percent in the following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period year ended december  gross profit prior year drug eluting stent system sales mix and pricing impact of crm ship hold net impact of foreign currency all other gross profit current year the primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during and  as compared to the prior years  was  in each year  a further decrease in sales of our higher margin taxus drug eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the promus stent system  as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems 
sales of the promus stent system represented approximately percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales in  percent in  and percent in as a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the gross profit margin of a promus stent system  supplied to us by abbott  is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched our next generation internally developed and manufactured promus element everolimus eluting 
table of contents stent system in our emea region and certain inter continental countries 
this product generates gross profit margins more favorable than the promus stent system  and has positively affected our overall gross profit and operating profit margins 
we expect to launch our promus element stent system in the us and japan in mid in addition  the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems have decreased  including an estimated nine percent decline in the us  in  as compared to our gross profit margin in was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm business previously discussed 
we expect our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  will continue to be negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices across our businesses 
in addition  our gross profit percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of our expected low margin sales of neurovascular product to stryker under the terms of our transitional supply agreements 
operating expenses the following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses year ended december  of net of net of net in millions sales sales sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses royalty expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  our sg a expenses decreased million  or two percent  as compared to this decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending  as compared to the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by an million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses were slightly higher than due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our us crm sales force  despite the reduction in our net sales of our crm products in the us we plan to increase our investment in sg a in to introduce new products  strengthen our sales organization in emerging markets such as brazil  china and india  and to support our acquired businesses  as a result  our sg a expenses are likely to increase slightly as a percentage of net sales in  as compared to in  our sg a expenses increased by million  or two percent  as compared to this increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count  including expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various litigation related matters 
these increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
research and development r d expenses in  our r d expenses decreased million  or nine percent  as compared to this decrease was due to the on going re prioritization of r d projects and the re allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns  as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials 
we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth 
in  our r d expenses increased million  or three percent  as compared to as a percentage of net sales  our r d expenses in were relatively flat with the prior year 
royalty expense 
table of contents in  our royalty expense decreased million  or three percent  as compared to this decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems  partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the promus and promus element stent systems 
the royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is  on average  higher than that associated with sales of our taxus stent systems 
in  our royalty expense decreased million  or six percent  as compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of million attributable to the expiration of a crm royalty agreement during the first quarter of partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of million as a result of an increase in sales of our drug eluting stent systems  as well as the shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the promus stent system  following its launch in the us in mid loss on program termination in the second quarter of  we discontinued one of our internal r d programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax loss of million  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations formerly fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  associated with future payments that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make 
we continue to focus on developing new technologies that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth in the future and do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows 
amortization expense amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million  or less than one percent 
this non cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or six percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain interventional cardiology related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life during  as well as the write down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in and  described in other intangible asset impairment charges below 
goodwill impairment charges we test our april goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crt d products  which we announced on march   and the expected corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policies and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  associated with our us crm reporting unit 
this charge does not impact our compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows  and is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
at the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test  we estimated that our us defibrillator market share would decrease approximately basis points exiting as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions  as compared to our market share exiting  and that these actions would negatively impact our us crm revenues by approximately million 
in addition  we expected that  our on going us crm net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions 
therefore  as a result of these product actions  as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures  we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our year discounted cash flow dcf model  as well as our terminal 
table of contents value growth rate  by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit 
the reduction in our forecasted us crm net sales  the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge 
partially offsetting these factors was a basis point reduction in our estimated market participant risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc used in determining our discount rate 
in the second quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units 
we updated our us crm assumptions to reflect our market share position at that time  our most recent operational budgets and long range strategic plans 
in conjunction with our annual test  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  with the exception of our us crm reporting unit 
based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge  the carrying value of our us crm business unit continues to exceed its fair value  due primarily to the book value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit 
the book value of our amortizable intangible assets which have been allocated to our us crm reporting unit is approximately billion as of december  we tested these amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of march   and determined that these assets were not impaired  and there have been no impairment indicators related to these assets subsequent to that test 
the assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test related to our us crm reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test  therefore  it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test on our international reporting units as a result of the announced divestiture of our neurovascular business 
we allocated a portion of our goodwill from our each of our international reporting units to the neurovascular business 
we then tested each of our international reporting units for impairment in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
our testing did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their calculated fair values 
refer to critical accounting estimates for a discussion of our goodwill balances as of december   including our assessment of reporting units with a higher risk of future impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our us crm reporting unit 
the impact of economic conditions  and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets  on our risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  along with reductions in market demand for products in our us crm reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of our acquisition of guidant  were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge 
intangible asset impairment charges during the first quarter of  due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our peripheral interventions technology offerings  as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology  we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product 
in addition  during the third quarter of  as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio  we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success 
as a result of these factors  we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded million of intangible asset impairment charges during to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value 
we do not believe that these impairments  or the factors causing these impairments  will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 
in  we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of million  associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our urology technology offerings 
we do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows 

table of contents in  we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of million  including a million write down of certain of our peripheral interventions related intangible assets  and a million write down of certain urology related intangible assets 
we do not believe that the write down of these assets will have a material impact on future operations or cash flows 
these non cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
refer to critical accounting estimates and note d goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for more information on our intangible asset impairment charges 
purchased research and development on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
r  business combinations codified within asc topic  business combinations 
among other changes to accounting for business combinations  statement no 
r superseded fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date 
statement no 
r now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts 
accordingly  we have accounted for purchased research and development acquired in connection with our business combinations as intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
our policy is to record certain costs associated with strategic investments outside of business combinations as purchased research and development 
our adoption of statement no 
r topic did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases 
in accordance with this policy  we recorded purchased research and development charges of million in  associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements 
since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by statement no

in  we recorded million of purchased research and development charges  including million associated with our acquisition of labcoat  ltd  million attributable to our acquisition of cryocor  inc  and million associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements 
these acquisition related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
contingent consideration expense in connection with our acquisitions  we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue based milestones 
as of the respective acquisition dates  we recorded total contingent liabilities of million  representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses 
in accordance with asc topic  we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates  as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates 
during  we recorded expense of million representing the increase in the estimated fair value of this obligation 
this acquisition related charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity

the mhlw approved the xience v stent system in the first quarter of and we received the 
table of contents milestone payment from abbott  which we recorded as a million pre tax gain 
this non recurring acquisition related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity

restructuring charges and restructuring related activities in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan the restructuring plan 
the plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value

reported tax rate impact of certain receipts charges the change in our reported tax rate for  as compared to  and  as compared to  relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
in  these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment  a gain associated with a litigation related settlement receipt  and restructuring related charges 
our reported tax rate was also net favorably affected by discrete items  related primarily to the re measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case  a resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case as well as conclusion of the appeals process for the federal examination for certain years 
in  these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges  purchased research and development charges  restructuring and litigation related net charges  a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture related gain recognized in a prior period  and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits

we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through and substantially all material state  local  and foreign income tax matters through we resolved a number of foreign examinations during as a result of these activities  we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties 
in addition  as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various foreign and state jurisdictions  we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties 
further  during  we concluded the appeals process for the federal tax examination for boston scientific excluding guidant covering years and decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties  net of payments 
we also re measured an uncertain tax position due to a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case and resolved another uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case  which resulted in a decrease of million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties 
during  we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters 
as a result of these activities  we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties 
in addition  statutes of limitations expired in various foreign and state jurisdictions  as a result  decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by million  inclusive of interest and penalties 
we also resolved certain litigation related matters  described in our annual report filed on form k 
based on the outcome of the settlements  we reassessed the reserve for uncertain tax positions previously recorded on certain positions and decreased our reserve by million  inclusive of million of interest 
during  we resolved certain matters in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions for guidant and boston scientific for the years we settled multiple federal issues at the internal revenue service irs examination and appellate levels  including issues related to guidant s acquisition of intermedics  inc  and various litigation settlements  described in note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  or our annual report filed on form k 
we also received favorable foreign court decisions and a favorable outcome related to our foreign research credit claims 
as a result of these audit activities  we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions  excluding tax payments  by million  inclusive of million of interest and penalties 
on december   we received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for the tax years 
the incremental tax liability asserted by the irs is million  plus interest 
the primary issue in dispute is the transfer pricing used in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant 
we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we intend to file a petition to the us tax court in early no payments will be made on the issue until it is resolved  which may take several years 
we believe that our income tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the federal tax returns of guidant corporation for the through april tax years and of boston scientific corporation for the tax years are currently under examination by the irs 
the relevant statutes of limitations for these examinations expire during december and september  respectively 
we do not anticipate that at the conclusion of these examinations  we will be able to reach an agreement with the irs regarding our federal tax liabilities for these years 
we expect that final resolution of these tax liabilities will require that we avail ourselves of applicable irs appellate and judicial procedures  as appropriate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  comprised of million invested in prime money market and government funds  million invested in short term time deposits  and million in interest bearing and non interest bearing bank accounts 
our policy is to invest excess cash in short term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal  and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer 
subsequent to year end  in january  we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation and received pre tax proceeds of billion at closing  including an upfront payment of billion  and million  which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions  and will receive million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities  which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately months 
in january  we paid at maturity million of our senior notes  and a million litigation related settlement associated with the us department of justice matter described previously  using cash on hand 
we also have full access to our billion revolving credit facility 
the following provides a summary and description of our cash inflows outflows for the years ended december    and year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used for provided by investing activities cash used for financing activities operating activities during  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was driven primarily by the payment of billion to johnson johnson related to a patent litigation settlement  as compared to approximately million of legal settlements paid in this cash outflow was partially offset by the receipt of a million milestone payment from abbott and million received in connection with a litigation settlement with medinol  each described in results of operations 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to billion in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due primarily to litigation related payments of million  consisting primarily of payments to johnson johnson associated with patent litigation settlements 
these cash outflows were partially offset by lower net tax payments of million and lower interest payments of million  due to lower average debt balances  as well as improvements in working capital 
investing activities during  our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of million  as well as payments of approximately million to acquire asthmatx  inc and certain other strategic assets  described in note b acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately million to million during  which includes capital expenditures to further upgrade our information systems infrastructure  and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units 
during  our investing activities included million of payments related to prior period acquisitions  comprised primarily of a final fixed payment of approximately million related to our prior period acquisition of advanced bionics corporation  described in note b acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report

during  our investing activities included proceeds of approximately billion associated with the divestiture of certain businesses  and million of proceeds associated with the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million in payments related to prior period acquisitions  associated primarily with advanced bionics  and million of net cash payments for investments in privately held companies  and acquisitions of certain technology rights 
in addition  we made capital expenditures of million and paid million  net of cash acquired  to acquire cryocor  inc and million  net of cash acquired  to acquire labcoat  ltd

there were no amounts borrowed under our credit facilities as of december  or december  as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  as compared to million as of december   which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers compensation insurance arrangements 
as of december  and  none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees  accordingly  we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  or we believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit 
in january  we paid at maturity million of our senior notes  in addition  we borrowed million under our credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables and used the proceeds to pre pay all million of our term loan maturities and million of our term loan maturities 
these prepayments are reflected as current in the table above  as well as in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this annual report

the credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  through the credit agreement maturity  of up to million in restructuring charges and restructuring related expenses related to our previously announced restructuring plans  plus an additional million for any future restructuring initiatives 
as of december   we had million of the aggregate restructuring charge exclusion remaining 
in addition  any litigation related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated ebitda until such items are paid or received  as well as up to billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards net of any litigation payments received  and litigation related cash payments net of cash receipts of up to billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of march  as of december   we had billion of the aggregate legal payment exclusion remaining 
as of and through december   we were in compliance with the required covenants 
our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants  both of which could result in additional borrowing costs 
further  there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers

see note b acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions 
legal matters the medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven 
physician customers  particularly in interventional cardiology  have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies 
as a result  intellectual property rights  particularly patents and trade secrets  play a significant role in product development and differentiation 
however  intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable 
furthermore  appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions 
in addition  competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines  technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties 
in some cases  several competitors are parties in the same proceeding  or in a series of related proceedings  or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices 
these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases  but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases 
in addition  although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought  remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal 
accordingly  the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time  predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies 
several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them 
we have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us 
adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions  or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in particular  although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with johnson johnson  we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them  particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
in the normal course of business  product liability  securities and commercial claims are asserted against us 
similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time 
we are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement  and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims 
the absence 
table of contents of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
product liability claims  securities and commercial litigation  and other legal proceedings in the future  regardless of their outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory  marketing and other business practices 
these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings  substantial fines  penalties and administrative remedies  divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was million as of december  and billion as of december   and includes estimated costs of settlement  damages and defense 
the decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of billion to johnson johnson in connection with the patent litigation settlement discussed in note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts  if any  that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and  therefore  additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future  which could materially adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
see further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note l 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings 
for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 
many of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system  which represents a future service obligation 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding multiple element arrangements applicable through december   we deferred revenue on the undelivered service element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value  using the residual method of allocation  and recognized the associated revenue over the related service period 
the use of an alternative method of allocation or estimate of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral in any given period 
on january   we adopted asc update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the consensus in update no 
supersedes certain guidance in topic formerly emerging 
table of contents issues task force eitf issue no 
 multiple element arrangements 
update no 
provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist  how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables  including requiring the use of the relative selling price method 
the adoption of update no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory in the future 
further  the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess  expired and obsolete inventory 
valuation of intangible assets we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination  including purchased research and development  on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
further  for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration  we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future 
we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates  as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions  or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical  regulatory or revenue based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable  as discussed in note a  we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified 
in addition  we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
to test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  we write the carrying value down to the fair value 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
goodwill valuation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill 
we test our april goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the assessment  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc 
table of contents topic  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments  and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics 
for our april  annual impairment assessment  we identified our reporting units to be our seven us operating segments  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment  and our four international operating segments 
when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition 
in addition  for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining its fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
during   and  we used only the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach 
therefore  we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill  we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use estimates of market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests  these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 
we have identified a total of four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  our us cardiovascular unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  our us neuromodulation unit  which holds billion of allocated 
table of contents goodwill  and our emea unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill 
the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit  whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value ranged from approximately six percent to percent 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect changes that would warrant an interim impairment test 
the key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates  levels of profitability and perpetual growth rate assumptions  as well as the wacc 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels 
for each of these reporting units  relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges 
for example  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point increase in the wacc applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our us crm  us neuromodulation  and emea reporting units failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in addition  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point decrease in perpetual growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for all four of the reporting units with higher risk of impairment 
the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates are our best estimates and we believe they are reasonable  but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill 
see note d goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further discussion of our and goodwill impairment charges  as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units 
income taxes we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years

table of contents additional information use of non gaap financial measures use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures used by boston scientific to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap measures  including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts  and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income loss  the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income loss per share 
to calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange  we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign exchange rates 
the gaap measure most comparable to this non gaap measure is growth rate percentages based on gaap revenue 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measure are included elsewhere in this annual report 
management uses these supplemental non gaap measures to evaluate performance period over period  to analyze the underlying trends in our business  to assess our performance relative to our competitors  and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources and determining compensation 
in addition  management uses these non gaap measures to further its understanding of the performance of operating segments 
the adjustments excluded from our non gaap measures are consistent with those excluded from our reportable segments measure of profit or loss 
these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance 
the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of its non gaap measures for the years ended december   and  as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges these amounts represent non cash write downs of the goodwill balance attributable to our us cardiac rhythm management business  as well as certain intangible assets balances 
following our acquisition of guidant corporation in  and the related increase in debt  we have heightened our focus on cash generation and debt pay down 
we remove the impact of these charges from operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations 
we believe this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt 
therefore  these charges are excluded from management s assessment of operating performance and are also excluded from the measures used to set employee compensation 
accordingly  management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore has excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 

table of contents acquisition related charges credits these adjustments consist of a purchased research and development charges  b contingent consideration expense  c gains on acquisition related milestone receipts  d due diligence and other fees  and e inventory step up adjustments 
purchased research and development is a highly variable charge based on the extent and nature of external technology acquisitions during the period 
contingent consideration expense represents accounting adjustments to state our contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value 
these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood of making future contingent consideration payments 
in addition  contingent consideration expense was not recognized based on accounting principles in place previous to  and  therefore  is not comparable to periods prior to acquisition related gains resulted from receipts related to guidant corporation s sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to abbott laboratories  and are not indicative of future operating results 
due diligence and other fees include legal  tax and other one time expenses associated with recent acquisitions that are not representative of on going operations 
inventory step up adjustments are non cash charges related to acquired inventory directly attributable to acquisitions and is not indicative of the our on going operations  or on going cost of products sold 
management therefore removes the impact of these credits charges from our operating results to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance 
divestiture related charges credits these amounts represent fees associated with business divestitures and gains and related tax impacts that we recognized related to the sale of certain non strategic investments 
these gains and losses are not indicative of future operating performance and are not used by management to assess operating performance 
accordingly  management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance 
restructuring and restructuring related costs these adjustments represent costs associated with our restructuring plan  plant network optimization program and restructuring plan 
these expenses are excluded by management in assessing operating performance  as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
accordingly  management excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance 
litigation related net credits charges these amounts are attributable to certain significant patent litigation and other legal matters  none of which reflect expected on going operating expenses 
accordingly  management excluded these credits charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance 
discrete tax items these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions  which were initially established in prior periods as a result of acquisition  divestiture  restructuring or litigation related charges credits 
these adjustments do not reflect expected on going operating results 
accordingly  management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance 
amortization expense amortization expense is a non cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our debt agreements 
management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations 
management believes this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt 
therefore  amortization expense is excluded from management s assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation 
accordingly  management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore excludes amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 

table of contents foreign exchange on net sales the impact of foreign exchange is highly variable and difficult to predict 
accordingly  management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance 
material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures adjusted net income  adjusted net income per diluted share  and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange may have limitations as analytical tools  and these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for gaap financial measures 
some of the limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures are amortization expense and goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  though not directly affecting our cash flows  represent a net reduction in value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the net loss associated with this reduction in value is not included in our adjusted net income or adjusted net income per diluted share and therefore these measures do not reflect the full effect of the reduction in value of those assets 
acquisition and divestiture related charges credits reflect economic costs and benefits and are not reflected in adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 
items such as restructuring and restructuring related costs  litigation related net credits charges  and discrete tax items that are excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share can have a material impact on cash flows and gaap net income loss and net income loss per diluted share 
revenue growth rates stated on a constant currency basis  by their nature  exclude the impact of foreign exchange  which may have a material impact on gaap net sales 
other companies may calculate adjusted net income  adjusted net income per diluted share  or regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange differently than us  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 
compensation for limitations associated with use of non gaap financial measures we compensate for the limitations on non gaap financial measures by relying upon gaap results to gain a complete picture of performance 
the non gaap measures focus instead upon the core business  which is only a subset  albeit a critical one  of overall performance 
we provide detailed reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure elsewhere in this annual report  and encourage investors to review these reconciliations 
usefulness of non gaap financial measures to investors we believe that presenting adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share  and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange  in addition to the related gaap measures  provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we further believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance

a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
