on october   we acquired toptable  a leading restaurant reservation site in the united kingdom  which contributed million to revenues from the date of acquisition through december  we intend to continue to incur substantial expenses in advance of recognizing material related revenues as we attempt to further penetrate our existing international markets and selectively enter new markets

table of contents income taxes we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business 
earnings from our non us activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current us income tax 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  the points based loyalty program  website and software development costs  income taxes and stock based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues include installation fees for our erb including training  monthly subscription fees and a fee for each restaurant guest seated through online reservations 
we provide our application as a service  and follow the provisions of topic revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts paid by the customer include the right to use our hardware during the service period 
proportionate revenue related to the right to use our hardware accounts for less than of revenues for the periods presented 
revenues from the installation of our erb are recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life  commencing with customer acceptance 
the estimated customer life is approximately three to six years  based on historical restaurant customer termination activity 
estimates made by us may differ from actual customer lives 
these differences may materially affect installation and other revenue by increasing or decreasing revenue  depending on whether the estimated customer life decreases or increases 
a change in the estimated customer life by one year in either direction would have a minimal impact to total revenue of less than 
subscription revenues are recognized on a straight line basis during the contractual period over which the service is delivered 
reservation revenues or per seated diner fees are recognized on a transaction by transaction basis as diners are seated by our restaurant customers 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenues or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues are shown net of redeemable dining points issued to diners as described below 
during the third quarter of  we began selling third party restaurant coupons through our website 
we earn a commission for acting as an agent in these transactions which is recorded on a net basis and is included in revenue upon completion of the third party coupon sale 
the liability for redemption and potential income for breakage remain with the third party restaurants  therefore  we do not record redemption or breakage of the coupons 
we apply a sales allowance for potential coupon refunds 

table of contents revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 
dining rewards loyalty program we provide a points based loyalty program  opentable dining rewards  to registered diners who book and honor reservations through the opentable website 
opentable dining rewards involves the issuance of dining points  which can be accumulated and redeemed for dining checks 
the standard award is points per reservation  but diners can earn  points for reservations during featured times under the opentable dining rewards program 
when a diner accumulates a minimum of  points  he or she may redeem them for a dining check 
every dining points is equal to one dollar 
diners may present dining checks at any opentable restaurant and their bill is reduced by the check amount 
the restaurant then deposits the dining check to its bank 
if a diner does not make a seated reservation within any month period  then his or her account is considered inactive and the dining points balance is reset to zero 
as is typical with points based incentive programs  many dining points expire unused 
in addition  some dining checks are never used 
the recorded expense is an estimate of the eventual cash outlay related to the issued dining points and is booked at the time the points are earned by the diner ie  when the diner is seated by the restaurant 
we estimate the cost of the issued dining points by analyzing historical patterns of redemption and check cashing activity 
these historical patterns are evaluated in light of any current or proposed program changes that may impact future point redemption 
actual redemption rates could differ from our estimates used in assessing the contra revenue amounts and corresponding liability  particularly if participation in our premium listings programs  with higher point awards  increases 
these differences could materially affect reservation revenues 
for example  an increase of in the redemption rate as of december  would result in a reduction in revenues of million and an increase in the dining rewards payable liability of 
we recognize the cost and a corresponding liability associated with dining points as contra revenue in accordance with topic revenue recognition customer payments and incentives 
website and software development costs costs related to website and internal use software are accounted for in accordance with topic intangibles goodwill and other topic 
such software is primarily related to our websites  including support systems 
in accordance with topic  we capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed  management has authorized and committed project funding  and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended 
such costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset  generally estimated between two to three years 
costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the enhancements 
we follow the guidance in topic software in accounting for costs incurred in connection with development of the software contained in the erb used by all restaurant customers  and in a limited number of certain transactions we sell reservation systems that do not include our ongoing service 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of a computer product to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and through general product release are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life 
the period between technological feasibility and general product release is generally short  and the costs incurred during this stage are not considered to be material and are expensed as incurred 

table of contents income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with topic income taxes topic 
under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with topic the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been considered 
for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included herein  we estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of our tax returns 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance  we consider all the evidence available to us  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result of this analysis  for the year ended december  and consistent with prior years  it was determined that certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and foreign branch net operating losses did not meet the more likely than not realizability threshold which increased our valuation allowance to million 
stock based compensation we measure stock based awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock units in accordance with topic stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of restricted stock units is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

however  we also had unrecognized tax benefits arising from our current year stock option deduction that may reduce substantially all of the cash impact upon settlement  assuming such benefits are not recognized prior to the settlement of the liability 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued topic revenue recognition and topic software 
topic revenue recognition requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
topic software removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
topic revenue recognition and topic software should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after september   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of topic revenue recognition and topic software on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the fasb updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level inputs  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for 
table of contents each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of the updated guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate  foreign exchange risks and inflation 
interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  money market accounts  certificates of deposit and us government agency securities 
short term investments consist of us government agency securities and certificates of deposit 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenues and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound sterling  the euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
