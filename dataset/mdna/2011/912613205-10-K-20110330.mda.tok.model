item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trackingusso s benchmark in this annual report on form k 
what are futures contracts in a futures contract  one party agrees to buy a commodity such as crude oil from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed upon when the contract is made 
futures contracts are traded on futures exchanges  including the nymex 
for example  the futures contract is traded on the nymex in units of  barrels 
the crude oil futures contracts traded on the nymex are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an open outcry of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic  screen based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell 
to achieve its investment objective  usso needs to maintain short positions in the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments in which it invests 
a short position is one in which usso has sold the futures contract or other crude oil related investment and must buy it back or otherwise close out the position in the future 
as a result  a drop in the market value of the investment would lead to a potential gain for usso  while an increase in the market value of the investment would lead to a potential loss for usso 
typically a short position will produce a result that is the inverse of buying the futures contract or other crude oil related investment an approach referred to as being long the investment 
certain typical and significant characteristics of futures contracts are discussed below 
additional risks of investing in or taking short positions in futures contracts are included in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
impact of accountability levels  position limits and price fluctuation limits 
futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics 
most significantly  the cftc and us designated contract markets such as the nymex have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge  which an investment by usso is not may hold  own or control 
the net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity 
in addition  most us futures exchanges  such as the nymex  limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts 
currently  the ice futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by the nymex but does not limit the maximum daily price fluctuation 
the accountability levels for the benchmark futures contract and other futures contracts traded on the nymex are not a fixed ceiling  but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions 
the current accountability level for any one month in the benchmark futures contract is  net contracts 
in addition  the nymex imposes an accountability level for all months of  net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for light  sweet crude oil 
if usso and the related public funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for light  sweet crude oil  the nymex will monitor usso s and the related public funds exposure and ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions  investment and trading strategy  and the extent of liquidity resources of usso and the related public funds 
if deemed necessary by the nymex  it could also order usso and the related public funds to reduce their aggregate net position back to the accountability level 
in addition  the ice futures maintains the same accountability levels  position limits and monitoring authority for its light  sweet crude oil contract as the nymex 
as of december   usso and the related public funds held short positions in nymex crude oil futures cl contracts 
if the nymex or the ice futures orders usso to reduce its position back to the accountability level  or to an accountability level that the nymex or the ice futures deems appropriate for usso  such an accountability level may impact the mix of short positions in crude oil interests made by usso 
to illustrate  assume that the benchmark futures contract and the unit price of usso are each  and that the nymex has determined that usso may not be short more than  benchmark futures contracts 
in such case  usso could take short positions up to billion of its daily net assets in the benchmark futures contract ie  per contract multiplied by  a benchmark futures contract is a contract for  barrels of oil multiplied by  contracts before reaching the accountability level imposed by the nymex 
once the daily net assets of the portfolio exceed billion in the benchmark futures contract  the portfolio may not be able to take any further short positions in the benchmark futures contract 
if the nymex were to impose limits at the billion level or another level  usso anticipates that it would invest the majority of its assets above that level in a mix of other futures contracts or other crude oil related investments in order to meet its investment objective 
see item a 
risk factors risks associated with investing directly or indirectly in crude oil regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing  future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect usso in this annual report on form k 
in addition to accountability levels  the nymex and the ice futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
it is unlikely that usso will run up against such position limits because usso s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract 
us futures exchanges  including the nymex  also limit the amount of price fluctuation for futures contracts 
for example  the nymex imposes a per barrel  per contract price fluctuation limit for futures contracts 
this limit is initially based off the previous trading day s settlement price 
if any futures contract is traded  bid  or offered at the limit for five minutes  trading is halted for five minutes 
when trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be per barrel in either direction of that point 
if another halt were triggered  the market would continue to be expanded by per barrel in either direction after each successive five minute trading halt 
there is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session 
currently  us futures exchanges  including the nymex  do not implement fixed position limits for futures contracts held outside of the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
however  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   requires the cftc to establish aggregate position limits that apply to both cleared and uncleared commodity swaps in addition to exchange traded futures contracts held by an entity and certain of its affiliates 
such position limits could limit usso s ability to invest in accordance with its investment objective 
on january   the cftc proposed new rules  which if implemented in their proposed form  would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures  including futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
the cftc has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
at this time  it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect 
the cftc s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire  which  under the cftc s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges  could take effect as early as spring based on the cftc s current proposal  other position limits would not take effect until march or later 
the effect of this future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict  but it could be substantial and adverse 
usso anticipates that to the extent it takes short positions in futures contracts other than light  sweet crude oil contracts such as futures contracts for brent crude oil  natural gas  heating oil  and gasoline and other crude oil related investments  it will enter into various non exchange traded derivative contracts to hedge the short term price movements of such futures contracts and other crude oil related investments against the current benchmark futures contract 
examples of the position and price limits currently imposed are as follows futures contract position accountability levels and limits maximum daily price fluctuation nymex light  sweet crude oil physically settled any one month  net futures all months  net futures  but not to exceed  contracts in the last three days of trading in the spot month

when trading resumes  the limit is expanded by per mmbtu in either direction 
if another halt were triggered  the market would continue to be expanded by per mmbtu in either direction after each successive five minute trading halt 
there will be no maximum price fluctuation limits during any one trading session 
price volatility 
despite daily price limits  the price volatility of futures contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds 
price volatility often is greater day to day as opposed to intra day 
futures contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for crude oil are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by crude oil futures traders throughout the day 
these economic factors include changes in interest rates  governmental  agricultural  trade  fiscal  monetary and exchange control programs and policies  weather and climate conditions  changing supply and demand relationships  changes in balances of payments and trade  us and international rates of inflation  currency devaluations and revaluations  us and international political and economic events  and changes in philosophies and emotions of market participants 
because usso invests a significant portion of its assets in short positions in futures contracts  the assets of usso  and therefore the prices of usso units  may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities 
marking to market futures positions 
futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly 
this process of marking to market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account 
therefore  if usso s futures positions have declined in value  usso may be required to post additional variation margin to cover this decline 
alternatively  if usso futures positions have increased in value  this increase will be credited to usso s account 
what is the crude oil market and the petroleum based fuel market usso may take short positions in futures contracts traded on the nymex that are based on light  sweet crude oil 
it may also take short positions in contracts on other exchanges  including the ice futures and the singapore exchange 
the contracts provide for delivery of several grades of domestic and internationally traded foreign crudes  and  among other things  serve the diverse needs of the physical market 
in europe  brent crude oil is the standard for futures contracts and is primarily traded on the ice futures 
brent crude oil is the price reference for two thirds of the world s traded oil 
the ice brent futures is a deliverable contract with an option to cash settle which trades in units of  barrels  us gallons 
the ice futures also offers a wti crude oil futures contract which trades in units of  barrels 
the wti crude oil futures contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for us light  sweet crude oil 
light  sweet crude oil 
crude oil is the world s most actively traded commodity 
the futures contracts for light  sweet crude oil that are traded on the nymex are the world s most liquid forum for crude oil trading  as well as the world s largest volume futures contract trading on a physical commodity 
due to the liquidity and price transparency of light  sweet crude oil futures contracts  they are used as a principal international pricing benchmark 
the futures contracts for light  sweet crude oil trade on the nymex in units of  us barrels and  if not closed out before maturity  will result in delivery of oil to cushing  oklahoma  which is also accessible to the international spot markets by two major interstate petroleum pipeline systems 
demand for petroleum products by consumers  as well as agricultural  manufacturing and transportation industries  determines demand for crude oil by refiners 
since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity  crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions 
however  other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand 
crude oil supply is determined by both economic and political factors 
oil prices along with drilling costs  availability of attractive prospects for drilling  taxes and technology  among other factors determine exploration and development spending  which influence output capacity with a lag 
in the short run  production decisions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec also affect supply and prices 
oil export embargoes and the current conflict in the middle east represent other routes through which political developments move the market 
it is not possible to predict the aggregate effect of all or any combination of these factors 
heating oil 
heating oil  also known as no 
fuel oil  accounts for approximately of the yield of a barrel of crude oil  the second largest cut from oil after gasoline 
the heating oil futures contract  listed and traded on the nymex trades in units of  gallons  barrels and is based on delivery in the new york harbor  the principal cash market trading center 
the price of heating oil has historically been volatile 
gasoline 
gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the us and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption 
the gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the nymex trades in units of  gallons  barrels and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the new york harbor  the major east coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the new york harbor area or from the gulf coast refining centers 
the price of gasoline has historically been volatile 
natural gas 
natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of us energy consumption 
the natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the nymex trades in units of  mmbtu and is based on delivery at the henry hub in louisiana  the nexus of intra and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region prolific gas deposits 
the pipelines serve markets throughout the us east coast  the gulf coast  the midwest  and up to the canadian border 
the price of natural gas has historically been volatile 
why does usso purchase and sell futures contracts usso s investment objective is to have the changes in percentage terms of its units nav inversely reflect the changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light  sweet crude oil delivered to cushing  oklahoma  as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract on light  sweet crude oil as traded on the nymex that is the near month contract to expire  except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration  in which case the futures contract will be the next month contract to expire  less usso s expenses 
usso seeks to have its aggregate nav approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments it holds 
to achieve its investment objective  usso anticipates that it will need to maintain short positions in the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments in which it invests 
a short position is one in which usso will have sold the futures contract or other crude oil related investment and must buy it back or otherwise close out the position in the future 
as a result  a drop in the market value of the investment would lead to a potential gain for usso  while an increase in the market value of the investment would lead to a potential loss for usso 
typically a short position will produce a result that is the inverse of buying the futures contract or other crude oil related investment an approach referred to as being long the investment 
uscf expects the performance of usso to generally be inverse to the performance of usof  another commodity pool managed by uscf  which seeks to have the changes in percentage terms of its units nav track the changes in percentage terms in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil as traded in the united states 
other than taking short positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  usso only invests in assets to support these investments in crude oil interests 
at any given time  most of usso s investments are in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting usso s positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
for example  the purchase of a futures contract with a stated value of million would not require usso to pay million upon entering into the contract  rather  only a margin deposit  generally of to of the stated value of the futures contract  would be required 
to secure its futures contract obligations  usso would deposit the required margin with the futures commission merchant and would separately hold  through its custodian  treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract  which at the contract s inception would be million minus the amount of the margin deposit  or million assuming a margin 
as a result of the foregoing  typically to of usso s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a futures commission merchant 
in addition to the treasuries or cash it posts with the futures commission merchant for the futures contracts it owns  usso holds  through the custodian  treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that can be posted as margin or as collateral to support its over the counter contracts 
usso earns income from the treasuries and or cash equivalents that it purchases  and on the cash it holds through the custodian 
usso anticipates that the earned income will increase the nav and limited partners capital contribution accounts 
usso reinvests the earned income  holds it in cash  or uses it to pay its expenses 
if usso reinvests the earned income  it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective 
what is the flow of units 
pgjpg 
what are the trading policies of usso liquidity usso invests only in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that are traded in sufficient volume to permit  in the opinion of uscf  ease of taking and liquidating positions in these financial interests 
spot commodities while certain of the futures contracts traded on the nymex can be physically settled  usso does not intend to take or make physical delivery 
usso may from time to time trade in other crude oil related investments  including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil 
leverage while usso s historical ratio of initial margin to total assets has generally ranged from approximately to  uscf endeavors to have the value of usso s treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents  whether held by usso or posted as margin or collateral  at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under usso s futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
while uscf does not intend to leverage usso s assets  it is not prohibited from doing so under the lp agreement 
borrowings borrowings are not used by usso unless usso is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery  usso trades in cash commodities  or for short term needs created by unexpected redemptions 
usso maintains the value of its treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents  whether held by usso or posted as margin or collateral  to at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
usso has not established and does not plan to establish credit lines 
over the counter derivatives including spreads and straddles in addition to futures contracts  there are also a number of listed options on the futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges 
these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market 
consequently  usso may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective 
in addition to the futures contracts and options on the futures contracts  there also exists an active non exchange traded market in derivatives tied to crude oil 
these derivatives transactions also known as over the counter contracts are usually entered into between two parties 
unlike most of the exchange traded futures contracts or exchange traded options on the futures contracts  each party to such contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract 
some crude oil based derivatives transactions contain fairly generic terms and conditions and are available from a wide range of participants 
other crude oil based derivatives have highly customized terms and conditions and are not as widely available 
many of these over the counter contracts are cash settled forwards for the future delivery of crude oil or petroleum based fuels that have terms similar to the futures contracts 
others take the form of swaps in which the two parties exchange cash flows based on pre determined formulas tied to the crude oil spot price  forward crude oil price  the benchmark futures contract price  or other crude oil futures contract price 
for example  usso may enter into over the counter derivative contracts whose value will be tied to changes in the difference between the crude oil spot price  the benchmark futures contract price  or some other futures contract price traded on the nymex or ice futures and the price of other futures contracts that may be invested in by usso 
to protect itself from the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts  usso may enter into agreements with each counterparty that provide for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty  such as the agreements published by the international swaps and derivatives association  inc usso also may require that the counterparty be highly rated and or provide collateral or other credit support to address usso s exposure to the counterparty 
uscf assesses or reviews  as appropriate  the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over the counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf board 
furthermore  uscf on behalf of usso only enters into over the counter contracts with counterparties who are  or are affiliates of  a banks regulated by a united states federal bank regulator  b broker dealers regulated by the us securities and exchange commission the sec  c insurance companies domiciled in the united states  or d producers  users or traders of energy  whether or not regulated by the cftc 
any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the united states or the united kingdom unless otherwise approved by uscf s board after consultation with its legal counsel 
existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by uscf 
usso may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the benchmark futures contract 
usso would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset  but with different delivery months 
the effect of holding such combined positions is to adjust the sensitivity of usso to changes in the price relationship between futures contracts which will expire sooner and those that will expire later 
usso would use such a spread if uscf felt that taking such long and short positions  when combined with the rest of its holdings  would more closely track the investment goals of usso  or if uscf felt it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in crude oil prices 
usso would enter into a straddle when it chooses to take an option position consisting of a long or short position in both a call option and put option 
the economic effect of holding certain combinations of put options and call options can be very similar to that of owning the underlying futures contracts 
usso would make use of such a straddle approach if  in the opinion of uscf  the resulting combination would more closely track the investment goals of usso or if it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in crude oil prices 
usso has not employed any hedging methods since all of its investments have been made over an exchange 
therefore  usso has not been exposed to counterparty risk 
pyramiding usso has not and will not employ the technique  commonly known as pyramiding  in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest

these fees were approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  in addition  usso is responsible for the fees and expenses  which may include director and officers liability insurance  of the independent directors of uscf in connection with their activities with respect to usso 
these director fees and expenses may be shared with usof  usng  usof  uga  usho  usbo and usng 
these fees and expenses for were  and usso s portion of such fees and expenses was  form of units registered form 
units are issued in registered form in accordance with the lp agreement 
the administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring units in certificated form 
the administrator keeps a record of all limited partners and holders of the units in certificated form in the registry the register 
uscf recognizes transfers of units in certificated form only if done in accordance with the lp agreement 
the beneficial interests in such units are held in book entry form through participants and or accountholders in the dtc 
book entry 
individual certificates are not issued for the units 
instead  units are represented by one or more global certificates  which are deposited by the administrator with dtc and registered in the name of cede co  as nominee for dtc 
the global certificates evidence all of the units outstanding at any time 
unitholders are limited to participants in dtc such as banks  brokers  dealers and trust companies dtc participants  those who maintain  either directly or indirectly  a custodial relationship with a dtc participant indirect participants  and those banks  brokers  dealers  trust companies and others who hold interests in the units through dtc participants or indirect participants  in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of units 
dtc participants acting on behalf of investors holding units through such participants accounts in dtc will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for dtc s same day funds settlement system 
units are credited to dtc participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment 
dtc 
dtc is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the state of new york and is a member of the federal reserve system  a clearing corporation within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act 
dtc holds securities for dtc participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between dtc participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of dtc participants 
transfer of units transfers of units only through dtc 
the units are only transferable through the book entry system of dtc 
limited partners who are not dtc participants may transfer their units through dtc by instructing the dtc participant holding their units or by instructing the indirect participant or other entity through which their units are held to transfer the units 
transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice 
transfers of interests in units with dtc are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of dtc and the nature of the transfer 
dtc has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and or accountholders of dtc 
because dtc can only act on behalf of dtc participants  who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants  the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in dtc  or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest  may be affected by the lack of a definitive security in respect of such interest 
dtc has advised usso that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a unitholder including  without limitation  the presentation of a global certificate for exchange only at the direction of one or more dtc participants in whose account with dtc interests in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such dtc participant or participants has or have given such direction 
transfer application requirements 
all purchasers of usso s units  and potentially any purchasers of units in the future  who wish to become limited partners or other record holders and receive cash distributions  if any  or have certain other rights  must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that  among other things  he  she or it agrees to be bound by usso s lp agreement and is eligible to purchase usso s securities 
each purchaser of units must execute a transfer application and certification 
the obligation to provide the form of transfer application is imposed on the seller of units or  if a purchase of units is made through an exchange  the form may be obtained directly through usso 
further  uscf may request each record holder to furnish certain information  including that record holder s nationality  citizenship or other related status 
a record holder is a unitholder that is  or has applied to be  a limited partner 
an investor who is not a us resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or one of usso s limited partners if that investor s ownership would subject usso to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of usso s assets under any federal  state or local law or regulation 
if the record holder fails to furnish the information or if uscf determines  on the basis of the information furnished by the holder in response to the request  that such holder is not qualified to become one of usso s limited partners  uscf may be substituted as a holder for the record holder  who will then be treated as a non citizen assignee  and usso will have the right to redeem those securities held by the record holder 
a transferee s broker  agent or nominee may complete  execute and deliver a transfer application and certification 
usso may  at its discretion  treat the nominee holder of a unit as the absolute owner 
in that case  the beneficial holder s rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder 
a person purchasing usso s existing units  who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities 
whether or not a transfer application is received or the consent of uscf obtained  usso s units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing transfers of securities 
any transfer of units will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by uscf unless a completed transfer application is delivered to uscf or the administrator 
when acquiring units  the transferee of such units that completes a transfer application will be an assignee until admitted as a substituted limited partner upon the consent and sole discretion of uscf and the recording of the assignment on the books and records of the partnership  automatically request admission as a substituted limited partner  agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of  and execute  usso s lp agreement  represent that such transferee has the capacity and authority to enter into usso s lp agreement  grant powers of attorney to uscf as usso s general partner and any liquidator of usso  and make the consents and waivers contained in usso s lp agreement 
an assignee will become a limited partner in respect of the transferred units upon the consent of uscf as general partner of usso and the recordation of the name of the assignee on usso s books and records 
such consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of uscf as general partner of usso 
if consent of uscf is withheld  such transferee shall be an assignee 
an assignee shall have an interest in the partnership equivalent to that of a limited partner with respect to allocations and distributions  including  without limitation  liquidating distributions  of the partnership 
with respect to voting rights attributable to units that are held by assignees  uscf shall be deemed to be the limited partner with respect thereto and shall  in exercising the voting rights in respect of such units on any matter  vote such units at the written direction of the assignee who is the record holder of such units 
if no such written direction is received  such units will not be voted 
an assignee shall have no other rights of a limited partner 
until a unit has been transferred on usso s books  usso and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the unit as the absolute owner for all purposes  except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations 
withdrawal of limited partners as discussed in the lp agreement  if uscf gives at least fifteen days written notice to a limited partner  then uscf may for any reason  in its sole discretion  require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account 
if uscf does not give at least fifteen days written notice to a limited partner  then it may only require withdrawal of all or any portion of the capital account of any limited partner in the following circumstances i the unitholder made a misrepresentation to uscf in connection with its purchase of units  or ii the limited partner s ownership of units would result in the violation of any law or regulations applicable to the partnership or a partner 
in these circumstances  uscf without notice may require the withdrawal at any time  or retroactively 
the limited partner thus designated shall withdraw from the partnership or withdraw that portion of its partner capital account specified  as the case may be  as of the close of business on such date as determined by uscf 
the limited partner thus designated shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the partnership or to have made a partial withdrawal from its partner capital account  as the case may be  without further action on the part of the limited partner and the provisions of the lp agreement shall apply 
calculating nav usso s nav is calculated by taking the current market value of its total assets  and subtracting any liabilities 
bbh co  the administrator  calculates the nav of usso once each nyse arca trading day 
the nav for a particular trading day is released after pm new york time 
trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at pm new york time 
the administrator uses the nymex closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or pm new york time for the contracts traded on the nymex  but calculates or determines the value of all other usso investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or pm new york time in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among bbh co  usso and uscf  which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
in addition  in order to provide updated information relating to usso for use by investors and market professionals  the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value 
the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing nav per unit of usso as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active light  sweet futures contracts on the nymex 
the prices reported for those futures contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract 
in the event that the spot month contract is also the benchmark futures contract  the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted 
the indicative fund value unit basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav  because the nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of usso s investments 
the indicative fund value is disseminated on a per unit basis every seconds during regular nyse arca core trading session hours of am new york time to am new york time 
the normal trading hours of the nymex are am new york time to am new york time 
this means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which usso s units are traded on the nyse arca  but real time nymex trading prices for oil futures contracts traded on the nymex are not available 
as a result  during those gaps there will be no update to the indicative fund value 
the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of cta cq high speed lines 
in addition  the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arca s website and is available through on line information services such as bloomberg and reuters 
dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of usso units on the nyse arca 
investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of usso and the indicative fund value 
if the market price of usso units diverges significantly from the indicative fund value  market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades 
for example  if usso appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value  a market professional could buy usso units on the nyse arca and sell short oil futures contracts 
such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of usso and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants 
in addition  other futures contracts  other crude oil related investments and treasuries held by usso are valued by the administrator  using rates and points received from client approved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes 
these investments are not included in the indicative value 
the indicative fund value is based on the prior day s nav and moves up and down solely according to changes in near month benchmark futures contracts for light  sweet crude oil 
creation and redemption of units usso creates and redeems units from time to time  but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets 
the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usso or the distribution by usso of the amount of treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed  the amount of which is based on the combined nav of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after pm new york time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received 
authorized purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets 
authorized purchasers must be registered broker dealers or other securities market participants  such as banks and other financial institutions  that are not required to register as broker dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below  and dtc participants 
to become an authorized purchaser  a person must enter into an authorized purchaser agreement with uscf on behalf of usso 
the authorized purchaser agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions 
the authorized purchaser agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by usso  without the consent of any limited partner or unitholder or authorized purchaser 
authorized purchasers pay a transaction fee of  to usso for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets 
authorized purchasers who make deposits with usso in exchange for baskets receive no fees  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usso or uscf  and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usso to effect any sale or resale of units 
as of december   authorized purchasers had entered into agreements with uscf on behalf of usso 
during the year ended december   usso issued creation baskets and redeemed redemption baskets 
certain authorized purchasers are expected to have the facility to participate directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil futures market 
in some cases  an authorized purchaser or its affiliates may from time to time acquire crude oil or sell crude oil and may profit in these instances 
uscf believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely that an authorized purchaser s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will impact the price of crude oil  futures contracts  or the price of the units 
each authorized purchaser is required to be registered as a broker dealer under the exchange act and is a member in good standing with finra  or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be licensed as a broker dealer or a member of finra  and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires 
certain authorized purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations 
each authorized purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures  internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime 
under the authorized purchaser agreement  uscf has agreed to indemnify the authorized purchasers against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the securities act of  as amended  and to contribute to the payments the authorized purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities 
the following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the lp agreement and the form of authorized purchaser agreement for more detail  each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
creation procedures on any business day  an authorized purchaser may place an order with the marketing agent to create one or more baskets 
for purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders  a business day means any day other than a day when any of the nyse arca  the nymex or the nyse is closed for regular trading 
purchase orders must be placed by pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse arca  whichever is earlier 
the day on which the marketing agent receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date 
by placing a purchase order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deposit treasuries  cash  or a combination of treasuries and cash with usso  as described below 
prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order  the authorized purchaser must also have wired to the custodian the non refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order 
authorized purchasers may not withdraw a creation request 
determination of required deposits the total deposit required to create each basket creation basket deposit is the amount of treasuries and or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usso net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees  expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to purchase is accepted as the number of units to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received 
uscf determines  directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the administrator  the requirements for treasuries and the amount of cash  including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury and proportions of treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets 
the marketing agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day 
the amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the treasuries required to be included in a creation basket deposit as of pm new york time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit 
delivery of required deposits an authorized purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to usso s account with the custodian the required amount of treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date 
upon receipt of the deposit amount  the administrator directs dtc to credit the number of baskets ordered to the authorized purchaser s dtc account on the third business day following the purchase order date 
the expense and risk of delivery and ownership of treasuries until such treasuries have been received by the custodian on behalf of usso is borne solely by the authorized purchaser 
because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by pm  new york time  but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after pm new york time on the date the purchase order is received  authorized purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket 
usso s nav and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined 
rejection of purchase orders uscf acting by itself or through the marketing agent may reject a purchase order or a creation basket deposit if it determines that the investment alternative available to usso at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective  it determines that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit is not in proper form  it believes that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit would have adverse tax consequences to usso or its unitholders  the acceptance or receipt of the creation basket deposit would  in the opinion of counsel to uscf  be unlawful  or circumstances outside the control of uscf  marketing agent or custodian make it  for all practical purposes  not feasible to process creations of baskets 
none of uscf  the marketing agent or the custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or creation basket deposit 
redemption procedures the procedures by which an authorized purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets 
on any business day  an authorized purchaser may place an order with the marketing agent to redeem one or more baskets 
redemption orders must be placed by pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse  whichever is earlier 
a redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the marketing agent 
the redemption procedures allow authorized purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual unitholder to redeem any units in an amount less than a redemption basket  or to redeem baskets other than through an authorized purchaser 
by placing a redemption order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through dtc s book entry system to usso not later than pm new york time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order 
prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order  the authorized purchaser must also have wired to usso s account at the custodian the non refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order 
authorized purchasers may not withdraw a redemption request 
determination of redemption distribution the redemption distribution from usso consists of a transfer to the redeeming authorized purchaser of an amount of treasuries and cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usso net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees  expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of units to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received 
uscf  directly or in consultation with the administrator  determines the requirements for treasuries and the amounts of cash  including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury  and the proportions of treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets 
the marketing agent will publish such requirements as of pm new york time on the redemption order date 
delivery of redemption distribution the redemption distribution due from usso will be delivered to the authorized purchaser by pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if  by pm new york time on such third business day  usso s dtc account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed 
if usso s dtc account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time  the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received 
any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if usso receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which uscf may  from time to time  determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to usso s dtc account by pm new york time on such next business day 
any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled 
pursuant to information from uscf  the custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to usso s dtc account by pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the authorized purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through dtc s book entry system on such terms as uscf may from time to time determine 
suspension or rejection of redemption orders uscf may  in its discretion  suspend the right of redemption  or postpone the redemption settlement date  for any period during which the nyse arca or the nymex is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings  or trading on the nyse arca or the nymex is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery  disposal or evaluation of treasuries is not reasonably practicable  or for such other period as uscf determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners 
for example  uscf may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of usso s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption 
if uscf has difficulty liquidating its positions  eg  because of a market disruption event in the futures markets  a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract  it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified 
none of uscf  the marketing agent  the administrator  or the custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement 
redemption orders must be made in whole baskets 
uscf will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the authorized purchaser agreement or if the fulfillment of the order  in the opinion of its counsel  might be unlawful 
uscf may also reject a redemption order if the number of units being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding units to  units ie  one basket or less  unless uscf has reason to believe that the placer of the redemption order does in fact possess all the outstanding units and can deliver them 
creation and redemption transaction fee to compensate usso for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets  an authorized purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee to usso of  per order to create or redeem baskets 
an order may include multiple baskets 
the transaction fee may be reduced  increased or otherwise changed by uscf 
uscf shall notify dtc of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until days after the date of the notice 
tax responsibility authorized purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax  sales or use tax  stamp tax  recording tax  value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets  regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the authorized purchaser  and agree to indemnify uscf and usso if they are required by law to pay any such tax  together with any applicable penalties  additions to tax or interest thereon 
secondary market transactions as noted  usso creates and redeems units from time to time  but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets 
the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usso or the distribution by usso of the amount of treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed  the amount of which will be based on the aggregate nav of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received 
as discussed above  authorized purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets 
authorized purchasers must be registered broker dealers or other securities market participants  such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker dealers to engage in securities transactions 
an authorized purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets  and an authorized purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public units of any baskets it does create 
authorized purchasers that do offer to the public units from the baskets they create will do so at per unit offering prices that are expected to reflect  among other factors  the trading price of the units on the nyse arca  the nav of usso at the time the authorized purchaser purchased the creation baskets and the nav of the units at the time of the offer of the units to the public  the supply of and demand for units at the time of sale  and the liquidity of the futures contract market and the market for other crude oil related investments 
the prices of units offered by authorized purchasers are expected to fall between usso s nav and the trading price of the units on the nyse arca at the time of sale 
units initially comprising the same basket but offered by authorized purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices 
an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized purchaser on behalf of multiple clients 
authorized purchasers who make deposits with usso in exchange for baskets receive no fees  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usso or uscf  and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usso to effect any sale or resale of units 
units trade in the secondary market on the nyse arca 
units may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their nav per unit 
the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav per unit may be influenced by various factors  including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell units in the secondary market and the liquidity of the futures contracts market and the market for other crude oil related investments 
while the units trade during the core trading session on the nyse arca until pm new york time  liquidity in the market for futures contracts and other crude oil related investments may be reduced after the close of the nymex at pm new york time 
as a result  during this time  trading spreads  and the resulting premium or discount  on the units may widen 
prior performance of usso usso s units began trading on the nyse arca on september  and are offered on a continuous basis 
as of december   the total amount of money raised by usso from authorized purchasers was  the total number of authorized purchasers was  the number of baskets purchased by authorized purchasers was  the number of baskets redeemed by authorized purchasers was  and the aggregate amount of units purchased was  for more information on the performance of usso  see the performance tables below 
since its initial offering of  units  usso has not made any subsequent offering of its units 
as of december   usso had issued  units   of which were outstanding 
as of december   there were  units registered but not yet issued 
since the commencement of the offering of usso units to the public on september  to december   the simple average daily change in the inverse of its benchmark futures contract was  while the simple average daily change in the nav of usso over the same time period was 
the average daily difference was or basis points  where basis point equals of 
as a percentage of the daily movement of the benchmark futures contract  the average error in daily tracking by the nav was  meaning that over this time period usso s tracking error was within the plus or minus range established as its benchmark tracking goal

uscf  though under no obligation to do so  agreed to pay certain expenses  to the extent that such expenses exceeded basis points of usso s nav  on an annualized basis  through at least june  uscf has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods

partial from september  terms used in performance tables draw down losses experienced over a specified period 
draw down is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not reflect intra month figures 
worst monthly percentage draw down the largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading 
worst peak to valley draw down the largest percentage decline in the nav per unit over the history of the fund 
this need not be a continuous decline  but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns 
worst peak to valley draw down represents the greatest percentage decline from any month end nav per unit that occurs without such month end nav per unit being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent month end 
for example  if the nav per unit declined by in each of january and february  increased by in march and declined again by in april  a peak to trough drawdown analysis conducted as of the end of april would consider that drawdown to be still continuing and to be in amount  whereas if the nav per unit had increased by in march  the january february drawdown would have ended as of the end of february at the level

the commodity interest markets general the cea governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions  markets and intermediaries 
in december  the cea was amended by the commodity futures modernization act of the cfma  which substantially revised the regulatory framework governing certain commodity interest transactions and the markets on which they trade 
the cea  as amended by the cfma  now provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon the variables of the transaction 
in general  these variables include the type of instrument being traded eg  contracts for future delivery  options  swaps or spot contracts  the type of commodity underlying the instrument distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities  energy and metals commodities and financial commodities  the nature of the parties to the transaction retail  eligible contract participant  or eligible commercial entity  whether the transaction is entered into on a principal to principal or intermediated basis  the type of market on which the transaction occurs  and whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization 
information regarding commodity interest transactions  markets and intermediaries  and their associated regulatory environment  is provided below 
the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action 
considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states 
under the dodd frank act and otherwise  there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering  perhaps to a material extent  the nature of an investment in usso or the ability of usso to continue to implement its investment strategy 
in addition  various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general 
the effect of any future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict but it could be substantial and adverse 
in the wake of the economic crisis of and  the administration  federal regulators and congress are revisiting the regulation of the financial sector  including the securities and commodities markets 
these efforts are anticipated to result in significant changes in the regulation of these markets 
the dodd frank act includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests 
provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy based and other commodity futures contracts  certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over the counter commodity contracts  new registration  recordkeeping  capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations  and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over the counter market 
additionally  the new law requires the aggregation  for purposes of position limits  of all positions in commodity futures and certain commodity swaps held by a single entity and its affiliates  whether such positions exist on us futures exchanges  us futures exchanges  or in over the counter swaps 
the cftc  along with the sec and other federal regulators  has been tasked with developing the rules and regulations enacting the provisions noted above 
the new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact usso s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties 
in particular  new position limits imposed on usso or its counterparties may impact usso s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective and new requirements  including capital and mandatory clearing  may increase the cost of usso s investments and doing business 
for a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the cftc and the potential impacts thereof on usso  please see item business what are futures contracts in this annual report on form k 
futures contracts a futures contract is a standardized contract traded on  or subject to the rules of  an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place 
futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities  including agricultural products  bonds  stock indices  interest rates  currencies  energy and metals 
the size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation  other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller 
the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery 
the difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase  after allowance for brokerage commissions  constitutes the profit or loss to the trader 
some futures contracts  such as stock index contracts  settle in cash reflecting the difference between the contract purchase sale price and the contract settlement price rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity 
in market terminology  a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market 
before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase  his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions 
the aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract 
forward contracts a forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and  therefore  is economically similar to a futures contract 
unlike futures contracts  however  forward contracts are typically traded in the over the counter markets and are not standardized contracts 
forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved 
moreover  generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a us exchange 
if a trader desires to close out a forward contract position  he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date 
thus  unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately  in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date  and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date 
in recent years  however  the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized  and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity 
the forward markets provide what has typically been a highly liquid market for foreign exchange trading  and in certain cases the prices quoted for foreign exchange forward contracts may be more favorable than the prices for foreign exchange futures contracts traded on us exchanges 
to date  the forward markets have been largely unregulated  forward contracts have been executed bilaterally and  in general  forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party 
commercial banks participating in trading foreign exchange forward contracts often have not required margin deposits  but have relied upon internal credit limitations and their judgments regarding the creditworthiness of their counterparties 
in recent years  however  many over the counter market participants in foreign exchange trading have begun to require that their counterparties post margin 
forward contracts may be treated differently under the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act requires that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and be cleared through regulated clearing organizations which are referred to in the dodd frank act as derivatives clearing organizations 
however  not all forward contracts will be subject to regulation as swaps under the dodd frank act 
those forward contracts that will not be regulated as swaps  which include physically settled non financial commodity forward contracts  will also not be subject to the dodd frank act s execution and clearing requirements 
with respect to foreign exchange forward contracts  the dodd frank act contemplates that such contracts may be regulated as swaps but gives the secretary of the united states department of treasury treasury the authority to exempt them from certain regulations under the cea  including mandatory clearing and margin requirements 
to date  the secretary of treasury has not made any final determinations on this issue 
absent a clearing facility whether because of regulatory requirements or otherwise  usso s trading in foreign exchange and other forward contracts is exposed to the creditworthiness of the counterparties on the other side of the trade 
the organized exchanges and swap execution facilities on which swaps may be traded  the regulation and criteria for such trading and the regulation and criteria for clearing organizations are more fully described below under futures exchanges and clearing organizations 
options on futures contracts options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange 
an option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right  but not the obligation  to take a position at a specified price the striking  strike  or exercise price in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest 
the buyer of a call option acquires the right  but not the obligation  to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest  and the buyer of a put option acquires the right  but not the obligation  to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest 
the seller  or writer  of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised 
thus  the seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option 
the seller of a put option  on the other hand  must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price 
a call option is said to be in the money if the strike price is below current market levels and out of the money if the strike price is above current market levels 
conversely  a put option is said to be in the money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out of the money if the strike price is below current market levels 
options have limited life spans  usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest 
some options  however  expire significantly in advance of such date 
the purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium  which consists of its intrinsic value which is related to the underlying market value plus its time value 
as an option nears its expiration date  the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity 
an option that is out of the money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless 
on certain exchanges  in the money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date  but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date 
regardless of how much the market swings  the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium 
the option buyer deposits his premium with his broker  and the money goes to the option seller 
option sellers  on the other hand  face risks similar to participants in the futures markets 
for example  since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised  his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract 
because no one can predict exactly how the market will move  the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations 
options on forward contracts or commodities options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts 
an option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right  but not the obligation  to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity 
however  similar to forward contracts  options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over the counter market 
therefore  options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above 
swap contracts swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap 
swap contracts are principally traded off exchange  although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations 
swaps are usually entered into on a net basis  that is  the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement  with the parties receiving or paying  as the case may be  only the net amount of the two payments 
swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal 
accordingly  the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make 
in some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement 
if the counterparty to such a swap defaults  the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding 
some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties 
these transactions  known as cleared swaps  involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction  then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty 
once accepted by the clearing house  the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction 
in this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction 
the dodd frank act contains many provisions  which  once rules and regulations are implemented  would impact swap transactions 
at this time  it is unclear exactly what types of transactions will be regulated as swaps because the cftc has not implemented regulations with respect to the definition of swap 
the dodd frank act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through clearing organizations  but it is also currently unknown which swaps will be subject to such trading and clearing requirements 
if a swap is required to be cleared  the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization  subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines 
initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the cftc  the sec or another regulator  as prescribed by the dodd frank act 
at this time  the cftc has not promulgated final regulations to determine which entities will be regulated as swap dealers and major swap participants and thus have to comply with these capital and margin requirements as well as a multitude of other requirements under the dodd frank act 
in general  increased regulation of  and the imposition of additional costs on  swap transactions could have an adverse effect on usso by  for example  reducing the size of and therefore liquidity in the derivatives market  increasing transaction costs and decreasing the ability to customize derivative transactions 
participants the two broad classes of persons who trade commodities are hedgers and speculators 
hedgers include financial institutions that manage or deal in interest rate sensitive instruments  foreign currencies or stock portfolios  and commercial market participants  such as farmers and manufacturers  that market or process commodities 
hedging is a protective procedure designed to effectively lock in prices that would otherwise change due to an adverse movement in the price of the underlying commodity  for example  the adverse price movement between the time a merchandiser or processor enters into a contract to buy or sell a raw or processed commodity at a certain price and the time he must perform the contract 
in such a case  at the time the hedger contracts to physically sell the commodity at a future date he will simultaneously buy a futures or forward contract for the necessary equivalent quantity of the commodity 
at the time for performance of the contract  the hedger may accept delivery under his futures contract and sell the commodity quantity as required by his physical contract or he may buy the actual commodity  sell it under the physical contract and close out his position by making an offsetting sale of a futures contract 
the commodity interest markets enable the hedger to shift the risk of price fluctuations 
the usual objective of the hedger is to protect the profit that he expects to earn from farming  merchandising  or processing operations rather than to profit from his trading 
however  at times the impetus for a hedge transaction may result in part from speculative objectives and hedgers can end up paying higher prices than they would have  for example  if current market prices are lower than the locked in price 
unlike the hedger  the speculator generally expects neither to make nor take delivery of the underlying commodity 
instead  the speculator risks his capital with the hope of making profits from price fluctuations in the commodities 
the speculator is  in effect  the risk bearer who assumes the risks that the hedger seeks to avoid 
speculators rarely make or take delivery of the underlying commodity  rather they attempt to close out their positions prior to the delivery date 
because the speculator may take either a long or short position in commodities  it is possible for him to make profits or incur losses regardless of whether prices go up or down 
futures exchanges and clearing organizations futures exchanges provide centralized market facilities in which multiple persons have the ability to execute or trade contracts by accepting bids and offers from multiple participants 
futures exchanges may provide for execution of trades at a physical location utilizing trading pits and or may provide for trading to be done electronically through computerized matching of bids and offers pursuant to various algorithms 
members of a particular exchange and the trades executed on such exchange are subject to the rules of that exchange 
futures exchanges and clearing organizations are given reasonable latitude in promulgating rules and regulations to control and regulate their members 
examples of regulations by exchanges and clearing organizations include the establishment of initial margin levels  rules regarding trading practices  contract specifications  speculative position limits  daily price fluctuation limits  and execution and clearing fees 
clearing organizations provide services designed to mutualize or transfer the credit risk arising from the trading of contracts on an exchange or other electronic trading facility 
once trades made between members of an exchange or electronic trading facility have been confirmed  the clearing organization becomes substituted for the clearing member acting on behalf of each buyer and each seller of contracts traded on the exchange or trading platform and in effect becomes the other party to the trade 
thereafter  each clearing member party to the trade looks only to the clearing organization for performance 
the clearing organization generally establishes some sort of security or guarantee fund to which all clearing members of the exchange must contribute  this fund acts as an emergency buffer that is intended to enable the clearing organization to meet its obligations with regard to the other side of an insolvent clearing member s contracts 
furthermore  the clearing organization requires margin deposits and continuously marks positions to market to provide some assurance that its members will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations 
thus  a central function of the clearing organization is to ensure the integrity of trades  and members effecting transactions on an exchange need not concern themselves with the solvency of the party on the opposite side of the trade  their only remaining concerns are the respective solvencies of their own customers  their clearing broker and the clearing organization 
the clearing organizations do not deal with customers  but only with their member firms and the guarantee of performance for open positions provided by the clearing organization does not run to customers 
as required under the dodd frank act  the cftc has recently issued several proposed rules pertaining to clearing organizations referred to in the dodd frank act as derivatives clearing organizations to address the clearing organization application process  recordkeeping and reporting obligations for clearing organizations  and implement the following six core principles for clearing organizations participant and product eligibility  risk management  settlement procedures  treatment of funds  default rules and procedures and system safeguards 
the proposed rules require the clearing organizations to establish margin methodologies and require that margin be based on trades at the individual customer level as opposed to the clearing member level 
the proposed rules also require the clearing organization to report end of day positions at the customer level  as opposed to the clearing member level 
to date  the cftc has not implemented any final rules or regulations pertaining to the application process  recordkeeping and reporting  core principles  margin or any other requirements for clearing organizations 
us futures exchanges futures exchanges in the united states are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the cftc based on their designation as one of the following a designated contract market  a derivatives transaction execution facility  an exempt board of trade or an electronic trading facility 
a designated contract market is the most highly regulated level of futures exchange 
designated contract markets may offer products to retail customers on an unrestricted basis 
to be designated as a contract market  the exchange must demonstrate that it satisfies specified general criteria for designation  such as having the ability to prevent market manipulation  rules and procedures to ensure fair and equitable trading  position limits  dispute resolution procedures  minimization of conflicts of interest and protection of market participants 
among the principal designated contract markets in the united states are the chicago board of trade  the chicago mercantile exchange and the nymex 
each of the designated contract markets in the united states must provide for the clearance and settlement of transactions with a cftc registered clearing organization 
a derivatives transaction execution facility a dtef is a type of exchange that is subject to fewer regulatory requirements than a designated contract market but is subject to both commodity interest and participant limitations 
dtefs limit access to eligible traders that qualify as either eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities for futures and option contracts on commodities that have a nearly inexhaustible deliverable supply  are highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation  or have no cash market  security futures products  and futures and option contracts on commodities that the cftc may determine  on a case by case basis  are highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation 
in addition  certain commodity interests excluded or exempt from the cea  such as swaps  etc 
may be traded on a dtef 
there is no requirement that a dtef use a clearing organization  except with respect to trading in security futures contracts  in which case the clearing organization must be a securities clearing agency 
however  if futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a dtef are cleared  then it must be through a cftc registered clearing organization  except that some excluded or exempt commodities traded on a dtef may be cleared through a clearing organization other than one registered with the cftc 
an exempt board of trade is also a designated form of exchange 
an exempt board of trade is substantially unregulated  subject only to cftc anti fraud and anti manipulation authority 
an exempt board of trade is permitted to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts provided that the underlying commodity is not a security or securities index and has an inexhaustible deliverable supply or no cash market 
all traders on an exempt board of trade must qualify as eligible contract participants 
contracts deemed eligible to be traded on an exempt board of trade include contracts on interest rates  exchange rates  currencies  credit risks or measures  debt instruments  measures of inflation  or other macroeconomic indices or measures 
there is no requirement that an exempt board of trade use a clearing organization 
however  if contracts on an exempt board of trade are cleared  then it must be through a cftc registered clearing organization 
a board of trade electing to operate as an exempt board of trade must file a written notification with the cftc 
an electronic trading facility is a form of trading platform that operates by means of an electronic or telecommunications network and maintains an automated audit trail of bids  offers  and the matching of orders or the execution of transactions on the electronic trading facility 
the cea does not apply to  and the cftc has no jurisdiction over  transactions on an electronic trading facility in certain excluded commodities that are entered into between principals that qualify as eligible contract participants  subject only to cftc anti fraud and anti manipulation authority 
in general  excluded commodities include interest rates  currencies  securities  securities indices or other financial  economic or commercial indices or measures 
uscf intends to monitor the development of and opportunities and risks presented by the less regulated exchanges and exempt boards as well as other trading platforms currently in place or that are being considered by regulators and may  in the future  allocate a percentage of usso s assets to trading in products on these exchanges 
provided usso maintains assets exceeding million  usso would qualify as an eligible contract participant and thus would be able to trade on such exchanges 
non us futures exchanges non us futures exchanges differ in certain respects from their non us counterparts 
importantly  non us futures exchanges are not subject to regulation by the cftc  but rather are regulated by their home country regulator 
in contrast to us designated contract markets  some non us exchanges are principals markets  where trades remain the liability of the traders involved  and the exchange or an affiliated clearing organization  if any  does not become substituted for any party 
due to the absence of a clearing system  such exchanges are significantly more susceptible to disruptions 
further  participants in such markets must often satisfy themselves as to the individual creditworthiness of each entity with which they enter into a trade 
trading on non us exchanges is often in the currency of the exchange s home jurisdiction 
consequently  usso is subject to the additional risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between such currencies and us dollars and the possibility that exchange controls could be imposed in the future 
trading on non us exchanges may differ from trading on us exchanges in a variety of ways and  accordingly  may subject usso to additional risks 
accountability levels and position limits the cftc and us designated contract markets have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than a hedger  which usso is not may hold  own or control 
among the purposes of accountability levels and position limits is to prevent a corner or squeeze on a market or undue influence on prices by any single trader or group of traders 
the position limits currently established by the cftc apply to certain agricultural commodity interests  such as grains oats  barley  and flaxseed  soybeans  corn  wheat  cotton  eggs  rye  and potatoes  but not to interests in energy products 
in addition  us exchanges may set accountability levels and position limits for all commodity interests traded on that exchange 
for example  the current accountability level for investments at any one time in futures contracts for light  sweet crude oil including investments in the benchmark futures contract on the nymex is  contracts for one month and  contracts for all months 
the nymex also imposes position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
the ice futures has recently adopted similar accountability levels and position limits for certain of its futures contracts that are traded on the ice futures and settled against the price of a contract listed for trading on a us designated contract market such as the nymex 
certain exchanges or clearing organizations also set limits on the total net positions that may be held by a clearing broker 
in general  no position limits are in effect in forward or other over the counter contract trading or in trading on non us futures exchanges  although the principals with which usso and the clearing brokers may trade in such markets may impose such limits as a matter of credit policy 
for purposes of determining accountability levels and position limits  usso s commodity interest positions will not be attributable to investors in their own commodity interest trading 
the dodd frank act requires the cftc to promulgate rules establishing position limits for futures and option contracts on commodities as well as for swaps that are economically equivalent to futures or options 
currently  the exchanges impose position limits and accountability levels for certain commodity futures and options  but the cftc does not impose such limits 
on january   the cftc proposed new rules  which if implemented in their proposed form  would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures  including futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
the cftc has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
at this time  it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect 
the cftc s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire  which  under the cftc s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges  could take effect as early as spring based on the cftc s current proposal  other position limits would not take effect until march or later 
the effect of this future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict  but it could be substantial and adverse 
daily price limits currently  us futures exchanges but generally not us exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation in some futures contract or options on a futures contract prices during a single trading day by regulations 
these regulations specify what are referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or  more commonly  daily limits 
the daily limits establish the maximum amount that the price of a futures or options on a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price 
once the daily limit has been reached in a particular futures or options on a futures contract  no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit 
positions in the futures or options contract may then be taken or liquidated  if at all  only at inordinate expense or if traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit during the period for trading on such day 
because the daily limit rule governs price movement only for a particular trading day  it does not limit losses and may in fact substantially increase losses because it may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions 
futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days  thus preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting the trader to substantial losses for those days 
the concept of daily price limits is not relevant to over the counter contracts  including forwards and swaps  and thus such limits are not imposed by banks and others who deal in those markets 
in contrast  the nymex does not impose daily limits but rather limits the amount of price fluctuation for light  sweet crude oil futures contracts 
for example  the nymex imposes a per barrel  per contract price fluctuation limit for the benchmark futures contract 
this limit is initially based off the previous trading day s settlement price 
if any benchmark futures contract is traded  bid  or offered at the limit for five minutes  trading is halted for five minutes 
when trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be per barrel in either direction of that point 
if another halt were triggered  the market would continue to be expanded by per barrel in either direction after each successive five minute trading halt 
there is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session 
commodity prices commodity prices are volatile and  although ultimately determined by the interaction of supply and demand  are subject to many other influences  including the psychology of the marketplace and speculative assessments of future world and economic events 
political climate  interest rates  treaties  balance of payments  exchange controls and other governmental interventions as well as numerous other variables affect the commodity markets  and even with comparatively complete information it is impossible for any trader to predict reliably commodity prices 
regulation futures exchanges in the united states are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the cea depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market  dtef  exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility 
clearing organizations are also subject to the cea and cftc regulation 
the cftc is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges 
the cftc s function is to implement the cea s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets 
in addition  the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms 
the cftc possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of cpos and commodity trading advisors and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and or entities 
under the cea  a registered cpo  such as uscf  is required to make annual filings with the cftc describing its organization  capital structure  management and controlling persons 
in addition  the cea authorizes the cftc to require and review books and records of  and documents prepared by  registered cpos 
pursuant to this authority  the cftc requires cpos to keep accurate  current and orderly records for each pool that they operate 
the cftc may suspend the registration of a cpo if the cftc finds that the operator s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions  if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the cftc denying such person trading privileges on any exchange  and in certain other circumstances 
suspension  restriction or termination of uscf s registration as a cpo would prevent it  until that registration were to be reinstated  from managing usso  and might result in the termination of usso 
usso itself is not required to be registered with the cftc in any capacity 
the cea gives the cftc similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors 
if a trading advisor s commodity trading advisor registration were to be terminated  restricted or suspended  the trading advisor would be unable  until the registration were to be reinstated  to render trading advice to usso 
the cea requires all futures commission merchants  such as usso s clearing brokers  to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements  to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions  and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the cftc 
the cftc has similar authority over introducing brokers  or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades 
the cea authorizes the cftc to regulate trading by futures commission merchants and by their officers and directors  permits the cftc to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies  and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the cea 
the cea also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc 
usso s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the cea 
investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the cea 
the cftc has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the cea  which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the cftc for violation of the cea against a floor broker or a futures commission merchant  introducing broker  commodity trading advisor  cpo  and their respective associated persons 
pursuant to authority in the cea  the nfa has been formed and registered with the cftc as a registered futures association 
at the present time  the nfa is the only self regulatory organization for commodity interest professionals  other than futures exchanges 
the cftc has delegated to the nfa responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors  cpos  futures commission merchants  introducing brokers  and their respective associated persons and floor brokers 
uscf  each trading advisor  the selling agents and the clearing brokers are members of the nfa 
as such  they are subject to nfa standards relating to fair trade practices  financial condition and consumer protection 
usso itself is not required to become a member of the nfa 
as the self regulatory body of the commodity interest industry  the nfa promulgates rules governing the conduct of professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with these rules 
the nfa also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members 
the regulations of the cftc and the nfa prohibit any representation by a person registered with the cftc or by any member of the nfa  that registration with the cftc  or membership in the nfa  in any respect indicates that the cftc or the nfa  as the case may be  has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives 
the registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement 
likewise  no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement 
the regulation of commodity interest trading in the united states and other countries is an evolving area of the law 
the various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the cftc  the nfa  the futures exchanges  clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies 
the function of the cftc is to implement the objectives of the cea of preventing price manipulation and other disruptions to market integrity  avoiding systemic risk  preventing fraud and promoting innovation  competition and financial integrity of transactions 
as mentioned above  this regulation  among other things  provides that the trading of commodity interest contracts generally must be upon exchanges designated as contract markets or dtefs and that all trading on those exchanges must be done by or through exchange members 
under the cfma  commodity interest trading in some commodities between sophisticated persons may be traded on a trading facility not regulated by the cftc 
as a general matter  trading in spot contracts  forward contracts  options on forward contracts or commodities  or swap contracts between eligible contract participants is not within the jurisdiction of the cftc and may therefore be effectively unregulated 
the trading advisors may engage in those transactions on behalf of usso in reliance on this exclusion from regulation 
however  legislation currently under consideration by the us congress would remove the exclusion provided to these transactions and place them under federal regulation 
the proposed legislation would subject these contracts to new capital  margin  recordkeeping  and reporting requirements 
in general  the cftc does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as usso or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors 
although us banks are regulated in various ways by the federal reserve board  the comptroller of the currency and other us federal and state banking officials  banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets 
while the us government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies  it could choose to do so 
the imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions currencies 
trading in the interbank market also exposes usso to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which usso had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to usso 
the cftc is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non us futures exchanges and markets 
the cftc  however  has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non us futures contracts in the united states 
these regulations permit certain contracts traded on non us exchanges to be offered and sold in the united states 
commodity margin original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts 
maintenance margin is the amount generally less than the original margin to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin 
a margin deposit is like a cash performance bond 
it helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells 
futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage ranging upward from less than of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract 
because of such low margin requirements  price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that  in relation to the amount invested  are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation 
as discussed below  adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin 
in addition  the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract 
brokerage firms  such as usso s clearing brokers  carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower  and generally require higher  amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves 
the clearing brokers require usso to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts 
this requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion 
trading in the over the counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally does not require margin but generally does require the extension of credit between counterparties 
this extension of credit generally takes the form of transfers of collateral and or independent amounts 
collateral is transferred between counterparties during the term of an over the counter transaction based upon the changing value of the transaction  while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the start of an over the counter transaction 
when a trader purchases an option  there is no margin requirement  however  the option premium must be paid in full 
when a trader sells an option  on the other hand  he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and  in addition  an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option 
the margin requirements imposed on the selling of options  although adjusted to reflect the probability that out of the money options will not be exercised  can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly 
complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions  which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest 
margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker 
when the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements  a margin call is made by the broker 
if the margin call is not met within a reasonable time  the broker may close out the trader s position 
with respect to usso s trading  usso and not its investors personally is subject to margin calls 
finally  many major us exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would  in the case of some accounts  be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis  measuring the total risk of the combined positions 
the dodd frank act requires the cftc and sec to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization ie  uncleared swaps 
in addition  the dodd frank act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian 
at this time  the cftc has proposed a rule addressing this statutory right of certain market participants but has not implemented any rules on this issue and has not implemented any regulations regarding the margin requirements for uncleared swaps

item a 
risk factors 
the risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and usso s financial statements and the related notes 
risks associated with investing directly or indirectly in crude oil investing in crude oil interests subjects usso to the risks of the crude oil industry and this could result in large fluctuations in the price of usso s units 
usso is subject to the risks and hazards of the crude oil industry because it takes short positions in crude oil interests 
the risks and hazards that are inherent in the crude oil industry may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate 
if the changes in percentage terms of usso s units accurately track the inverse of the changes in percentage terms of the benchmark futures contract or the spot price of crude oil  then the price of its units may also fluctuate 
the exploration and production of crude oil are uncertain processes with many risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for crude oil is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production of crude oil  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  pipeline ruptures  spills or other supply disruptions  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
crude oil transmission  distribution  gathering  and processing activities involve numerous risks that may affect the price of crude oil 
there are a variety of hazards inherent in crude oil transmission  distribution  gathering  and processing  such as leaks  explosions  pollution  release of toxic substances  adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and flooding  pipeline failure  abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of crude oil  scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  physical damage to the gathering or transportation system  and other hazards which could affect the price of crude oil 
to the extent these hazards limit the supply or delivery of crude oil  crude oil prices will increase 
changes in the political climate could have negative consequences for crude oil prices 
tensions with iran  the world s fourth largest oil exporter  could put oil exports in jeopardy 
other global concerns include civil unrest and sabotage affecting the flow of oil from nigeria  a large oil exporter 
meanwhile  friction continues between the governments of the united states and venezuela  a major exporter of oil to the united states 
additionally  a series of production cuts by members of opec followed by a refusal to subsequently increase oil production have tightened world oil markets 
fluctuations in the reserve capacity of crude oil could impact future prices 
in the past  a supply disruption in one area of the world was softened by the ability of major oil producing nations such as saudi arabia to increase output to make up the difference 
now  much of that spare reserve capacity has been absorbed by increased demand 
the current global economic downturn  however  has led to a decrease in the demand for oil that lasted through and a corresponding increase in spare capacities 
according to the united states government s energy information administration  global oil demand is expected to rise by million barrels a day in  to a total global consumption of million barrels per day  up from million barrels per day in the price of usso s units may be influenced by factors such as the short term supply and demand for crude oil and the short term supply and demand for usso s units 
this may cause the units to trade at a price that is above or below usso s nav per unit 
accordingly  changes in the price of units may substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
if this variation occurs  then investors may not be able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
while it is expected that the trading prices of the units will fluctuate in accordance with changes in usso s nav  the prices of units may also be influenced by other factors  including the short term supply and demand for crude oil and the units 
there is no guarantee that the units will not trade at appreciable discounts from  and or premiums to  usso s nav 
this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from changes in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
this may be harmful to investors because if changes in the price of units vary substantially from changes in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil  then investors may not be able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oil related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
changes in usso s nav may not inversely correlate with changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
if this were to occur  investors may not be able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest inversely in crude oil 
uscf endeavors to invest usso s assets as fully as possible in short term futures contracts and other crude oil related investments so that the changes in percentage terms of the nav closely inversely correlate with the changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
however  changes in usso s nav may not correlate with the changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract for several reasons as set forth below usso i may not be able to sell buy the exact amount of futures contracts and other crude oil related investments to have a perfect correlation with nav  ii may not always be able to buy and sell futures contracts or other crude oil related investments at the market price  iii may not experience a perfect inverse correlation between the spot price of light  sweet crude oil and the underlying investments in futures contracts  other crude oil related investments and treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents  and iv is required to pay fees  including brokerage fees and the management fee  which will have an effect on the correlation 
short term supply and demand for light  sweet crude oil may cause the changes in the market price of the benchmark futures contract to vary from the changes in usso s nav if usso has fully invested in futures contracts that do not reflect such supply and demand and it is unable to replace such contracts with futures contracts that do reflect such supply and demand 
in addition  there are also technical differences between the two markets  eg  one is a physical market while the other is a futures market traded on exchanges that may cause variations between the spot price of crude oil and the prices of related futures contracts 
usso sells and buys only as many futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that it can to get the changes in percentage terms of the nav as close as possible to the inverse of changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
the remainder of its assets are invested in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents and are used to satisfy initial margin and additional margin requirements  if any  and to otherwise support its investments in crude oil interests 
investments in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents  both directly and as margin  will provide rates of return that vary from changes in the value of the spot price of light  sweet crude oil and the price of the benchmark futures contract 
in addition  because usso incurs certain expenses in connection with its investment activities  and holds most of its assets in more liquid short term securities for margin and other liquidity purposes and for redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis  uscf is generally not able to fully invest usso s assets in futures contracts or other crude oil related investments and there cannot be perfect correlation between changes in usso s nav and changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
as usso grows  there may be more or less correlation 
for example  if usso only has enough money to sell three benchmark futures contracts and it needs to sell four contracts to inversely track the price of oil then the correlation will be lower  but if it sells  benchmark futures contracts and it needs to sell  contracts then the correlation will be higher 
at certain asset levels  usso may be limited in its ability to purchase the benchmark futures contract or other futures contracts due to accountability levels imposed by the relevant exchanges 
to the extent that usso invests in these other futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  the correlation with the benchmark futures contract may be lower 
if usso is required to invest in other futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that are less correlated with the benchmark futures contract  usso would likely invest in over the counter contracts to increase the level of correlation of usso s assets 
over the counter contracts entail certain risks described below under over the counter contract risk 
usso may not be able to sell or buy the exact number of short positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments to have a perfect inverse correlation with the benchmark futures contract if the purchase price of the short positions in futures contracts required to be fully invested in such contracts is higher than the proceeds received for the sale of a creation basket on the day the basket was sold 
in such case  usso could not invest the entire proceeds from the purchase of the creation basket in such short positions for example  assume usso receives  for the sale of a creation basket and assume that the value of the short position in a futures contract for crude oil is  based on a price of per barrel  then usso could only invest in only short positions in such futures contracts with an aggregate value of  usso would be required to invest a percentage of the proceeds in cash  treasuries or other liquid securities to be deposited as margin with the futures commission merchant through which the contract was purchased 
the remainder of the purchase price for the creation basket would remain invested in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents or other liquid securities as determined by uscf from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions 
if the trading market for futures contracts is suspended or closed  usso may not be able to sell or purchase these investments at the last reported price for such investments 
if changes in usso s nav do not inversely correlate with changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract  then investing in usso may not be an effective way to hedge against oil related losses or indirectly invest in oil 
the benchmark futures contract may not correlate with the spot price of light  sweet crude oil and this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
if this were to occur  then investors may not be able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
when using the benchmark futures contract as a strategy to track the spot price of light  sweet crude oil  at best the correlation between changes in prices of such crude oil interests and the spot price of crude oil can be only approximate 
the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market  supply of and demand for such crude oil interests and technical influences in oil futures trading 
if there is a weak correlation between the crude oil interests and the spot price of light  sweet crude oil  then the price of units may not accurately track the spot price of light  sweet crude oil and investors may not be able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their oil related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
usso may experience a loss if it is required to sell treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired 
the value of treasuries generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates 
if usso is required to sell treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired  usso will experience a loss 
this loss may adversely impact the price of the units and may decrease the correlation between the price of the units  the price of the benchmark futures contract and other crude oil related investments  and the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
certain of usso s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time 
usso may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price 
it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market 
a market disruption  such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market in its currency  its crude oil production or exports  or in another major export  can also make it difficult to liquidate a position 
alternatively  limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations  such as accountability levels  position limits and daily price fluctuation limits  may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests 
unexpected market illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time 
in addition  usso has not and does not intend at this time to establish a credit facility  which would provide an additional source of liquidity and instead relies only on the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that it holds 
the anticipated large value of the positions in futures contracts that uscf will acquire or enter into for usso increases the risk of illiquidity 
the other crude oil related investments that usso invests in  such as negotiated over the counter contracts  may have a greater likelihood of being illiquid since they are contracts between two parties that take into account not only market risk  but also the relative credit  tax  and settlement risks under such contracts 
such contracts also have limited transferability that results from such risks and from the contract s express limitations 
because both futures contracts and other crude oil related investments may be illiquid  usso s crude oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated 
if the nature of hedgers and speculators in futures markets has shifted such that crude oil purchasers are the predominant hedgers in the market  usso might have to reinvest at higher futures prices or choose other crude oil related investments 
the changing nature of the hedgers and speculators in the crude oil market influences whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price 
in order to induce speculators to take the corresponding long side of the same futures contract  crude oil producers must generally be willing to sell futures contracts at prices that are below expected future spot prices 
conversely  if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the crude oil who purchase futures contracts to hedge against a rise in prices  then speculators will only take the short side of the futures contract if the futures price is greater than the expected future spot price of crude oil 
this can have significant implications for usso when it is time to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing futures contract into a new futures contract 
while usso does not intend to take physical delivery of oil under its futures contracts  physical delivery under such contracts impacts the value of the contracts 
while it is not the current intention of usso to take physical delivery of crude oil under any of its futures contracts  futures contracts are not required to be cash settled and it is possible to take delivery under some of these contracts 
storage costs associated with purchasing crude oil could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of futures contracts or other crude oil related investments 
storage costs include the time value of money invested in crude oil as a physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the crude oil less any benefits from ownership of crude oil that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract 
in general  futures contracts have a one month delay for contract delivery and the back month the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month includes storage costs 
to the extent that these storage costs change for crude oil while usso holds futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  the value of the futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  and therefore usso s nav  may change as well 
the price relationship between the near month contract and the next month contract that compose the benchmark futures contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of usso s nav  as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other crude oil price indices total returns 
the benchmark futures contract is the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration  when it is sold and near month contract is replaced with the next month contract to expire 
in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month contracts to expire  a situation described as backwardation in the futures market  then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark futures contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration 
as a result short positions in the benchmark futures contract would tend to track lower 
conversely  in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts to expire  a situation described as contango in the futures market  then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark futures contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration 
as a result short positions in the benchmark futures contract would tend to track higher 
when compared to total return of other price indices  such as the spot price of crude oil  the impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of usso s nav to vary significantly 
in the event of a prolonged period of backwardation  and absent the impact of rising or falling crude oil prices  this could have a significant negative impact on usso s nav and total return 
regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing  future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect usso 
the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes  regulations  and margin requirements 
in addition  the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency  including  for example  the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements  the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading 
the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action 
considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states 
under the dodd frank act  there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering  perhaps to a material extent  the nature of an investment in usso or the ability of usso to continue to implement its investment strategy 
in addition  various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general 
the effect of any future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict  but could be substantial and adverse 
in the wake of the economic crisis of and  the administration  federal regulators and congress are revisiting the regulation of the financial sector  including securities and commodities markets 
these efforts are anticipated to result in significant changes in the regulation of these markets 
the dodd frank act includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests 
provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy based and other commodity futures contracts  certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over the counter commodity contracts  new registration  recordkeeping  capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations  and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over the counter market 
additionally  the new law requires the aggregation  for purposes of position limits  of all positions in commodity futures and certain commodity swaps held by a single entity and its affiliates  whether such positions exist on us futures exchanges  us futures exchanges  or in over the counter swaps 
the cftc  along with the sec and other federal regulators  has been tasked with developing the rules and regulations enacting the provisions noted above 
the new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact usso s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties 
in particular  new position limits imposed on usso or its counterparties may impact usso s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective  and new requirements  including capital and mandatory clearing  may increase the cost of usso s investments and doing business  which could adversely affect usso s investors 
for a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the cftc and the potential impacts thereof on usso  please see item business what are futures contracts in this annual report on form k 
investing in usso for purposes of hedging may be subject to several risks including the possibility of losing the benefit of favorable market movement 
participants in the crude oil or in other industries may use usso as a vehicle to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oil related transactions 
there are several risks in connection with using usso as a hedging device 
while hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices  it can also preclude a hedger s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement 
in a hedging transaction  the hedger may be concerned that the hedged item will increase in price  but must recognize the risk that the price may instead decline and if this happens he will have lost his opportunity to profit from the change in price because the hedging transaction will result in a loss rather than a gain 
thus  the hedger foregoes the opportunity to profit from favorable price movements 
in addition  if the hedge is not a perfect one  the hedger can lose on the hedging transaction and not realize an offsetting gain in the value of the underlying item being hedged 
when using futures contracts as a hedging technique  at best  the correlation between changes in prices of futures contracts and of the items being hedged can be only approximate 
the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in speculative markets demand for futures and for crude oil products  technical influences in futures trading  and differences between anticipated energy costs being hedged and the instruments underlying the standard futures contracts available for trading 
even a well conceived hedge may be unsuccessful to some degree because of unexpected market behavior as well as the expenses associated with creating the hedge 
in addition  using an investment in usso as a hedge for changes in energy costs eg  investing in crude oil  heating oil  gasoline  natural gas or other fuels  or electricity may not correlate because changes in the spot price of crude oil may vary from changes in energy costs because the changes in the spot price of crude oil may not be at the same rate as changes in the price of other energy products  and  in any case  the spot price of crude oil does not reflect the refining  transportation  and other costs that may impact the hedger s energy costs 
an investment in usso may provide little or no diversification benefits 
thus  in a declining market  usso may have no gains to offset losses from other investments  and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in usso while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes 
historically  futures contracts and other crude oil related investments have generally been non correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds 
non correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions  on the one hand  and stocks or bonds  on the other hand 
however  there can be no assurance that such non correlation will continue during future periods 
if  contrary to historic patterns  usso s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets  investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the units 
in such a case  usso may have no gains to offset losses from other investments  and investors may suffer losses on their investment in usso at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments 
variables such as drought  floods  weather  embargoes  tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oil linked instruments  including futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  than on traditional securities 
these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject usso s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities 
non correlation should not be confused with negative correlation  where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other 
there is no historic evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets  such as stocks and bonds  are negatively correlated 
in the absence of negative correlation  usso cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market  or vice versa 
usso s operating risks usso is not a registered investment company so unitholders do not have the protections of the act 
usso is not an investment company subject to the act 
accordingly  investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which  for example  requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager 
uscf is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage trading activities 
in managing and directing the day to day activities and affairs of usso  uscf relies heavily on messrs 
howard mah and john hyland 
if messrs 
mah or hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities  it may have an adverse effect on the management of usso 
furthermore  messrs 
mah and hyland are currently involved in the management of the related public funds  and uscf has filed a registration statement for three other exchange traded security funds  usmi  usai and uscui 
mr 
mah is also employed by ameristock corporation  a registered investment adviser that manages a public mutual fund 
it is estimated that mr 
mah will spend approximately of his time on usso and related public fund matters 
mr 
hyland will spend approximately of his time on usso and related public fund matters 
to the extent that uscf establishes additional funds  even greater demands will be placed on messrs 
mah and hyland  as well as the other officers of uscf and its board 
accountability levels  position limits  and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause a tracking error  which could cause the price of units to substantially vary from the price of the benchmark futures contract and prevent investors from being able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
us designated contract markets such as the nymex have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge  which an investment by usso is not may hold  own or control 
for example  the current accountability level for investments at any one time in the benchmark futures contract is  while this is not a fixed ceiling  it is a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor  including limiting an investor to holding no more than  benchmark futures contracts 
with regard to position limits  the nymex limits an investor from holding more than  net futures in the last days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
in addition to accountability levels and position limits  the nymex also sets daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts 
the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price 
once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract  no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit 
for example  the nymex imposes a per barrel  per contract price fluctuation limit for the benchmark futures contract 
this limit is initially based off of the previous trading day s settlement price 
if any benchmark futures contract is traded  bid  or offered at the limit for five minutes  trading is halted for five minutes 
when trading resumes it begins at the point where the limit was imposed and the limit is reset to be per barrel in either direction of that point 
if another halt were triggered  the market would continue to be expanded by per barrel in either direction after each successive five minute trading halt 
there is no maximum price fluctuation limit during any one trading session 
currently  us futures exchanges  including the nymex  do not implement fixed position limits for futures contracts held outside of the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
however  the dodd frank act requires the cftc to promulgate rules establishing position limits for futures and options contracts on commodities as well as for swaps that are economically equivalent to futures or options 
on january   the cftc proposed new rules  which if implemented in their proposed form  would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures  including futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
the cftc has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
at this time  it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect 
the cftc set position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire  which  under the cftc s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges  could take effect as early as spring based on the cftc s current proposal  other position limits would not take effect until march or later 
the effect of this future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict  but it could be substantial and adverse 
all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the benchmark futures contract 
this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use usso as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
usso has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase short interests in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
if usso encounters accountability levels  position limits  or price fluctuation limits for futures contracts on the nymex  it may then  if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements  purchase futures contracts on the ice futures or other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures 
the futures contracts available on the ice futures are comparable to the contracts on the nymex  but they may have different underlying commodities  sizes  deliveries  and prices 
in addition  certain of the futures contracts available on the ice futures are subject to accountability levels and position limits 
there are technical and fundamental risks inherent in the trading system uscf employs 
uscf s trading system is quantitative in nature and it is possible that uscf might make a mathematical error 
in addition  it is also possible that a computer or software program may malfunction and cause an error in computation 
to the extent that uscf uses spreads and straddles as part of its trading strategy  there is the risk that the nav may not closely track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
spreads combine simultaneous long and short positions in related futures contracts that differ by commodity eg  long crude oil and short gasoline  by market eg  long wti crude futures  short brent crude futures  or by delivery month eg  long december  short november 
spreads gain or lose value as a result of relative changes in price between the long and short positions 
spreads often reduce risk to investors  because the contracts tend to move up or down together 
however  both legs of the spread could move against an investor simultaneously  in which case the spread would lose value 
certain types of spreads may face unlimited risk  eg  because the price of a futures contract underlying a short position can increase by an unlimited amount and the investor would have to take delivery or offset at that price 
a commodity straddle takes both long and short option positions in the same commodity in the same market and delivery month simultaneously 
the buyer of a straddle profits if either the long or the short leg of the straddle moves further than the combined cost of both options 
the seller of a straddle profits if both the long and short positions do not trade beyond a range equal to the combined premium for selling both options 
if uscf were to utilize a spread or straddle position and the spread performed differently than expected  the results could impact usso s tracking error 
this could affect usso s investment objective of having its nav closely track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
additionally  a loss on a spread position would negatively impact usso s absolute return 
usso and uscf may have conflicts of interest  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders 
usso and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain usso s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with usso s objective of having the value of its units nav track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
uscf s officers  directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to usso 
these persons are directors  officers or employees of other entities that may compete with usso for their services 
they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to usso and to those other entities 
in addition  uscf s principals  officers  directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account 
a conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as usso trades using the clearing broker to be used by usso 
a potential conflict also may occur if uscf s principals  officers  directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite  or ahead of  the positions taken by usso 
uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of usso  and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with the best interests of investors 
limited partners have limited voting control  which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amendment of the lp agreement  change in usso s basic investment policy  dissolution of this fund  or the sale or distribution of usso s assets 
uscf serves as the general partner to each of usso  usof  usng  usof  uga  usho  usng and usbo and the sponsor for usci  and will serve as the sponsor for usmi  usai and uscui  if such funds offer their securities to the public or begin operations 
uscf may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for usso may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages 
these trading decisions may be influenced since uscf also serves as the general partner or sponsor for all of the funds and is required to meet all of the funds investment objectives as well as usso s 
if uscf believes that a trading decision it made on behalf of usso might i impede its other funds from reaching their investment objectives  or ii improve the likelihood of meeting its other funds objectives  then uscf may choose to change its trading decision for usso  which could either impede or improve the opportunity for usso to meet its investment objective 
in addition  uscf is required to indemnify the officers and directors of its other funds if the need for indemnification arises 
this potential indemnification will cause uscf s assets to decrease 
if uscf s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification  then uscf may terminate and investors could lose their investment 
unitholders may only vote on the removal of uscf and limited partners have only limited voting rights 
unitholders and limited partners will not participate in the management of usso and do not control uscf so they will not have influence over basic matters that affect usso 
unitholders that have not applied to become limited partners have no voting rights  other than to remove uscf as the general partner of usso 
limited partners will have limited voting rights with respect to usso s affairs 
unitholders may remove uscf only if of the unitholders elect to do so 
unitholders and limited partners will not be permitted to participate in the management or control of usso or the conduct of its business 
unitholders and limited partners must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of uscf to manage usso s affairs 
uscf may manage a large amount of assets and this could affect usso s ability to trade profitably 
increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions 
in general  uscf does not intend to limit the amount of assets of usso that it may manage 
the more assets uscf manages  the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions 
usso could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio 
usso may terminate at any time  regardless of whether usso has incurred losses  subject to the terms of the lp agreement 
in particular  unforeseen circumstances  including the death  adjudication of incompetence  bankruptcy  dissolution  or removal of uscf as the general partner of usso could cause usso to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner  or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions 
however  no level of losses will require uscf to terminate usso 
usso s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment 
termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio 
limited partners may not have limited liability in certain circumstances  including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions 
under delaware law  a limited partner might be held liable for usso s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner 
a limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of usso s capital securities representing units 
however  a limited partner may be required to repay to usso any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances 
under delaware law  usso may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes usso s liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities to exceed the fair value of usso s assets 
delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution 
with adequate notice  a limited partner may be required to withdraw from the partnership for any reason 
if uscf gives at least fifteen days written notice to a limited partner  then uscf may for any reason  in its sole discretion  require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account 
uscf may require withdrawal even in situations where the limited partner has complied completely with the provisions of the lp agreement 
usso s existing units are  and any units usso issues in the future will be  subject to restrictions on transfer 
failure to satisfy these requirements will preclude a transferee from being able to have all the rights of a limited partner 
no transfer of any unit or interest therein may be made if such transfer would a violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the sec  any state securities commission  the cftc or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such transfer  or b cause usso to be taxable as a corporation or affect usso s existence or qualification as a limited partnership 
in addition  investors may only become limited partners if they transfer their units to purchasers that meet certain conditions outlined in the lp agreement  which provides that each record holder or limited partner or unitholder applying to become a limited partner each a record holder may be required by uscf to furnish certain information  including that holder s nationality  citizenship or other related status 
a transferee who is not a us resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or a limited partner if its ownership would subject usso to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of its assets under any federal  state or local law or regulation 
all purchasers of usso s units  who wish to become limited partners or record holders  and receive cash distributions  if any  or have certain other rights  must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that  among other things  he  she or it agrees to be bound by usso s lp agreement and is eligible to purchase usso s securities 
any transfer of units will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by usso unless a completed transfer application is delivered to uscf or the administrator 
a person purchasing usso s existing units  who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities 
whether or not a transfer application is received or the consent of uscf obtained  usso s units will be securities and will be transferable according to the laws governing transfers of securities 
see transfer of units 
usso does not expect to make cash distributions 
usso has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to re invest any realized gains in additional crude oil interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners 
therefore  unlike mutual funds  commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors  usso generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners 
an investor should not invest in usso if it will need cash distributions from usso to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of usso  if any  or for any other reason 
although usso does not intend to make cash distributions  the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution  eg  at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in crude oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax 
if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made 
there is a risk that usso will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such usso may not earn any profit 
usso pays brokerage charges of approximately based on futures commission merchant fees of per buy or sell  management fees of of nav on its average net assets  and over the counter spreads and extraordinary expenses eg  subsequent offering expenses  other expenses not in the ordinary course of business  including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the lp agreement and under agreements entered into by uscf on usso s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation that cannot be quantified 
these fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether usso s activities are profitable 
accordingly  usso must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit 
if offerings of the units do not raise sufficient funds to pay usso s future expenses and no other source of funding of expenses is found  usso may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
prior to the offering of units that commenced on september   all of usso s expenses were funded by uscf and its affiliates 
these payments by uscf and its affiliates were designed to allow usso the ability to commence the public offering of its units 
usso now directly pays certain of these fees and expenses 
uscf will continue to pay other fees and expenses  as set forth in the lp agreement 
if uscf and usso are unable to raise sufficient funds to cover their expenses or locate any other source of funding  usso may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
usso may incur higher fees and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships 
the clearing arrangements between the clearing brokers and usso generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given usso notice 
upon termination  uscf may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if usso intends to continue trading in futures contracts or other oil interests at its present level of capacity 
the services of any clearing broker may not be available  or even if available  these services may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated clearing arrangements 
usso may miss certain trading opportunities because it will not receive the benefit of the expertise of independent trading advisors 
uscf does not employ trading advisors for usso  however  it reserves the right to employ them in the future 
the only advisor to usso is uscf 
a lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to usso because it will not receive the benefit of a trading advisor s expertise 
an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the nav of usso 
if a substantial number of requests for redemption of redemption baskets are received by usso during a relatively short period of time  usso may not be able to satisfy the requests from usso s assets not committed to trading 
as a consequence  it could be necessary to liquidate positions in usso s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation 
the financial markets are currently in a period of disruption and usso does not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 
currently and throughout  and the first half of  the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends 
the conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency  closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry 
although the financial markets saw signs of a recovery beginning in late  the financial markets are still fragile and could fall into another recession 
another recession could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of usso s service providers and authorized purchasers which would impact the ability of uscf to achieve usso s investment objective 
the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of usso s assets  the clearing broker could be subject to proceedings that impair its ability to execute usso s trades 
under cftc regulations  a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account 
if a clearing broker fails to do so  or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker if the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account  the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy 
in that event  the clearing broker s customers  such as usso  are entitled to recover  even in respect of property specifically traceable to them  only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers 
the bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of usso s assets posted with the clearing broker  though the vast majority of usso s assets are held in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents with usso s custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker 
usso also may be subject to the risk of the failure of  or delay in performance by  any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations  if any  on which commodity interest contracts are traded 
in addition  to the extent usso s clearing broker is required to post usso s assets as margin to a clearinghouse  the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all of the clearing broker s customers 
if usso s clearing broker defaults to the clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise  then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account  including margin posted by usso and any other non defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker 
from time to time  the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business 
a clearing broker s involvement in costly or time consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations  which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear usso s trades 
the failure or insolvency of usso s custodian could result in a substantial loss of usso s assets 
as noted above  the vast majority of usso s assets are held in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents with usso s custodian 
the insolvency of the custodian could result in a complete loss of usso s assets held by that custodian  which  at any given time  would likely comprise a substantial portion of usso s total assets 
third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights  which may result in significant costs and diverted attention 
third parties may utilize usso s intellectual property or technology  including the use of its business methods  trademarks and trading program software  without permission 
uscf has a patent pending for usso s business method and it is registering its trademarks 
usso does not currently have any proprietary software 
however  if it obtains proprietary software in the future  then any unauthorized use of usso s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage 
usso may have difficulty monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents  trademarks  proprietary software and other technology 
also  third parties may independently develop business methods  trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights  including their copyrights  trademark rights  trade names  trade secrets and patent rights 
as a result  uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights  defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights  or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid 
any litigation of this type  even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits  may result in significant costs  divert its resources from usso  or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
the success of usso depends on the ability of uscf to accurately implement trading systems  and any failure to do so could subject usso to losses on such transactions 
uscf uses mathematical formulas built into a generally available spreadsheet program to decide whether it should buy or sell crude oil interests each day 
specifically  uscf uses the spreadsheet to make mathematical calculations and to monitor positions in crude oil interests and treasuries and correlations to the benchmark futures contract 
uscf must accurately process the spreadsheets outputs and execute the transactions called for by the formulas 
in addition  usso relies on uscf to properly operate and maintain its computer and communications systems 
execution of the formulas and operation of the systems are subject to human error 
any failure  inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the formulas or systems and executing usso s transactions could impair its ability to achieve usso s investment objective 
it could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information 
this could cause substantial losses on transactions 
usso may experience substantial losses on transactions if the computer or communications system fails 
usso s trading activities  including its risk management  depend on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting them 
extraordinary transaction volume  hardware or software failure  power or telecommunications failure  a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail 
any significant degradation or failure of the systems that uscf uses to gather and analyze information  enter orders  process data  monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions  liability to other parties  lost profit opportunities  damages to uscf s and usso s reputations  increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources 
if the computer and communications systems are not upgraded  usso s financial condition could be harmed 
the development of complex computer and communications systems and new technologies may render the existing computer and communications systems supporting usso s trading activities obsolete 
in addition  these computer and communications systems must be compatible with those of third parties  such as the systems of exchanges  clearing brokers and the executing brokers 
as a result  if these third parties upgrade their systems  uscf will need to make corresponding upgrades to continue effectively its trading activities 
usso s future success will depend on usso s ability to respond to changing technologies on a timely and cost effective basis 
usso depends on the reliable performance of the computer and communications systems of third parties  such as brokers and futures exchanges  and may experience substantial losses on transactions if they fail 
usso depends on the proper and timely function of complex computer and communications systems maintained and operated by the futures exchanges  brokers and other data providers that uscf uses to conduct trading activities 
failure or inadequate performance of any of these systems could adversely affect uscf s ability to complete transactions  including its ability to close out positions  and result in lost profit opportunities and significant losses on commodity interest transactions 
this could have a material adverse effect on revenues and materially reduce usso s available capital 
for example  unavailability of price quotations from third parties may make it difficult or impossible for uscf to use its proprietary software that it relies upon to conduct its trading activities 
unavailability of records from brokerage firms may make it difficult or impossible for uscf to accurately determine which transactions have been executed or the details  including price and time  of any transaction executed 
this unavailability of information also may make it difficult or impossible for uscf to reconcile its records of transactions with those of another party or to accomplish settlement of executed transactions 
the occurrence of a terrorist attack  or the outbreak  continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities could disrupt usso s trading activity and materially affect usso s profitability 
the operations of usso  the exchanges  brokers and counterparties with which usso does business  and the markets in which usso does business could be severely disrupted in the event of a major terrorist attack or the outbreak  continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities 
global anti terrorism initiatives and political unrest in the middle east and southeast asia continue to fuel this concern 
risk of leverage and volatility if uscf permits usso to become leveraged  investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment if usso s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable 
commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s or other commodity interests entire market value 
this feature permits commodity pools to leverage their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts or other commodity interests with an aggregate value in excess of the commodity pool s assets 
while this leverage can increase the pool s profits  relatively small adverse movements in the price of the pool s futures contracts can cause significant losses to the pool 
while uscf has not and does not currently intend to leverage usso s assets  it is not prohibited from doing so under the lp agreement or otherwise 
the price of crude oil is volatile which could cause large fluctuations in the price of units 
movements in the price of crude oil may be the result of factors outside of uscf s control and may not be anticipated by uscf 
among the factors that can cause volatility in the price of crude oil are worldwide or regional demand for energy  which is affected by economic conditions  the domestic and foreign supply and inventories of oil and gas  weather conditions  including abnormally mild winter or summer weather  and abnormally harsh winter or summer weather  availability and adequacy of pipeline and other transportation facilities  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  political conditions in gas or oil producing regions  technological advances relating to energy usage or relating to technology for exploration  production  refining and petrochemical manufacturing  the ability of members of opec to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and the impact of energy conservation efforts 
the impact of environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may affect the price of crude oil 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil wells 
other laws have prevented exploration and drilling of crude oil in certain environmentally sensitive federal lands and waters 
several environmental laws that have a direct or an indirect impact on the price of crude oil include  but are not limited to  the clean air act  clean water act  resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of the limited method for transporting and storing crude oil may cause the price of crude oil to increase 
crude oil is transported throughout the united states by way of pipelines  barges  tankers  trucks and rail cars and is stored in aboveground and underground storage facilities 
these systems may not be adequate to meet demand  especially in times of peak demand or in areas of the united states where crude oil service is already limited due to minimal pipeline and storage infrastructure 
as a result of the limited method for transporting and storing crude oil  the price of crude oil may increase 
over the counter contract risk currently  over the counter transactions are subject to little regulation 
a portion of usso s assets may be used to trade over the counter crude oil interest contracts  such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts 
over the counter contracts are typically traded on a principal to principal basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and are essentially unregulated by the cftc 
investors therefore do not receive the protection of cftc regulation or the statutory scheme of the cea in connection with this trading activity by usso 
the markets for over the counter contracts primarily rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets 
the limited regulation in these markets could expose usso in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants 
usso will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over the counter contracts entered into by usso or held by special purpose or structured vehicles 
usso faces the risk of non performance by the counterparties to the over the counter contracts 
unlike in futures contracts  the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution  rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions 
as a result  there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions 
a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to usso  in which case usso could suffer significant losses on these contracts 
if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties  usso may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding 
usso may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances 
usso may be subject to liquidity risk with respect to its over the counter contracts 
over the counter contracts may have terms that make them less marketable than futures contracts 
over the counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange  do not have uniform terms and conditions  and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support  such as collateral  and in general  they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty 
these conditions diminish the ability to realize the full value of such contracts 
in addition  even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk  sudden changes in the value of over the counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations 
the dodd frank act requires the cftc and sec to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization ie  uncleared swaps 
in addition  the dodd frank act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian 
at this time  the cftc has proposed a rule addressing this statutory right of certain market participants but has not implemented any rules on this issue and has not implemented any regulations regarding the margin requirements for uncleared swaps 
risk of trading in international markets trading in international markets could expose usso to credit and regulatory risk 
usso invests primarily in short interests in futures contracts  a significant portion of which are traded on united states exchanges  including the nymex 
however  a portion of usso s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside of the united states 
some non us markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts 
the cftc  nfa and the domestic exchanges have little  if any  regulatory authority over the activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges  including the execution  delivery and clearing of transactions  and have little  if any  power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non us laws 
similarly  the rights of market participants  such as usso  in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non us market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of us markets or brokers 
as a result  in these markets  usso has less legal and regulatory protection than it does when it trades domestically 
in some of these non us markets  the performance on a contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes usso to credit risk 
trading in non us markets also leaves usso susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the us dollar 
additionally  trading on non us exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls  expropriation  increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability 
an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets 
international trading activities subject usso to foreign exchange risk 
the price of any non us futures contract  option on any non us futures contract  or other non us other oil interest and  therefore  the potential profit and loss on such contract  may be affected by any variance in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the time it is liquidated  offset or exercised 
as a result  changes in the value of the local currency relative to the us dollar may cause losses to usso even if the contract traded is profitable 
usso s international trading could expose it to losses resulting from non us exchanges that are less developed or less reliable than united states exchanges 
some non us exchanges may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics 
in addition  usso may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders  and the historical market data on which uscf bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for us exchanges 
tax risk an investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions  if any  on its units 
cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf 
uscf has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to units 
investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and  in some cases  state  local  or foreign income tax  on their allocable share of usso s taxable income  without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions 
therefore  the tax liability of an investor with respect to its units may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed 
an investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its units 
due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by usso in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors  an investor s allocable share of usso s income  gain  deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its units for a taxable year 
this difference could be temporary or permanent and  if permanent  could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income 
items of income  gain  deduction  loss and credit with respect to units could be reallocated if the irs does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by usso in allocating those items  with potential adverse consequences for an investor 
the us tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large  publicly traded partnerships such as usso is in many respects uncertain 
usso applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income  gains  deductions  losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects unitholders economic gains and losses 
these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the code and applicable treasury regulations  however  and it is possible that the us internal revenue service will successfully challenge usso s allocation methods and require usso to reallocate items of income  gain  deduction  loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors 
if this occurs  investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest 
usso could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  which may substantially reduce the value of the units 
usso has received an opinion of counsel that  under current us federal income tax laws  usso will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  provided that i at least percent of usso s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the code  ii usso is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii usso does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
although uscf anticipates that usso has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years  that result cannot be assured 
usso has not requested and will not request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were to successfully assert that usso is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year  rather than passing through its income  gains  losses and deductions proportionately to unitholders  usso would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates 
in addition  although uscf does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to units  any distributions would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income 
taxation of usso as a corporation could materially reduce the after tax return on an investment in units and could substantially reduce the value of the units

although usso undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that usso may make directly to them or through reports that usso in the future files with the sec  including annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k 
introduction usso  a delaware limited partnership  is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca 
the investment objective of usso is for the changes in percentage terms of its units nav to inversely reflect the changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light  sweet crude oil delivered to cushing  oklahoma  as measured by the changes in the price of the futures contract for light  sweet crude oil traded on the nymex that is the near month contract to expire  except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration  in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire  less usso s expenses 
usso seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in short positions in a combination of futures contracts and other crude oil related investments such that changes in its nav  measured in percentage terms  will closely track the inverse of the changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract  also measured in percentage terms 
uscf believes the changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the changes in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
it is not the intent of usso to be operated in a fashion such that the nav will equal  in dollar terms  the spot price of light  sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light  sweet crude oil 
management believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
on any valuation day  the benchmark futures contract is the near month futures contract for light  sweet crude oil traded on the nymex unless the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case the benchmark futures contract becomes  over a day period  the next month contract for light  sweet crude oil traded on the nymex 
near month contract means the next contract traded on the nymex due to expire 
next month contract means the first contract traded on the nymex due to expire after the near month contract 
the regulation of commodity interests in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action 
on july   a broad financial regulatory reform bill  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  was signed into law that includes provisions altering the regulation of commodity interests 
provisions in the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy based and other commodity futures contracts  certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over the counter commodity contracts  new registration  recordkeeping  capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations  and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over the counter market 
the new law and the rules that are currently being and are expected to be promulgated thereunder may negatively impact usso s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties 
further  increased regulation of  and the imposition of additional costs on  swap transactions under the new legislation and implementing regulations could cause a reduction in the swap market and the overall derivatives markets  which could restrict liquidity and adversely affect usso 
in particular  new position limits imposed on usso or its counterparties may impact usso s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective  and new requirements  including capital and mandatory clearing  may increase the cost of usso s investments and doing business  which could adversely affect usso s investors 
on january   the cftc proposed new rules  which if implemented in their proposed form  would establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures  including futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
the cftc has also proposed aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
at this time  it is unknown precisely when such position limits would take effect 
the cftc s position limits for futures contracts held during the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire  which  under the cftc s proposed rule would be substantially similar to the position limits currently set by the exchanges  could take effect as early as spring based on the cftc s current proposal  other position limits would not take effect until march or later 
the effect of this future regulatory change on usso is impossible to predict  but it could be substantial and adverse 
uscf  which is registered as a cpo with the cftc  is authorized by the lp agreement to manage usso 
uscf is authorized by usso in its sole judgment to employ and establish the terms of employment for  and termination of  commodity trading advisors or futures commission merchants 
price movements crude oil futures prices were volatile during the year ended december  and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend between january and late march and a downward trend from april to late september and finishing the year with a sharp upward trend 
the price of the benchmark futures contract started the year at per barrel 
it hit a peak on december  at per barrel 
the low of the year was on may  when the price dropped to per barrel 
the year ended with the benchmark futures contract at per barrel  up approximately over the year 
usso s nav began the year at per unit and ended the year at per unit on december   a decrease of approximately over the year 
usso s nav reached its high for the year on may  at per unit and reached its low for the year on april  at per unit 
since usso s investment objective is to track the inverse of the changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract  the decrease in nav reflects the inverse of the increase in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
the benchmark futures contract prices listed above began with the february contract and ended with the february contract 
the return of approximately on the benchmark futures contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding futures contracts 
an investment in futures contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result 
furthermore  the change in the nominal price of these differing futures contracts  measured from the start of the year to the end of the year  does not represent the actual benchmark results that usso seeks to track  which are more fully described below  in the section titled tracking usso s benchmark 
during the year ended december   the level of contango remained mildly steep  meaning that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract was less than the price of the next month crude oil futures contract  or contracts further away from expiration 
crude oil inventories  which reached historic levels in january and february and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango  began to drop in march and continued to drop for the remainder of and the beginning of during the rest of the year ended december   crude oil inventories began to climb higher  which contributed to the crude oil futures market remaining in contango through the end of december for a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns  see term structure of crude oil prices and the impact on total returns below 
valuation of futures contracts and the computation of the nav the nav of usso s units is calculated once each nyse arca trading day 
the nav for a particular trading day is released after pm new york time 
trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at pm new york time 
the administrator uses the nymex closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or pm new york time for the contracts held on the nymex  but calculates or determines the value of all other usso investments  including ice futures contracts or other futures contracts  as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or pm new york time 
results of operations and the crude oil market results of operations 
on september   usso listed its units on the nyse arca under the ticker symbol dno 
on that day  usso established its initial offering price at per unit and issued  units to the initial authorized purchaser  deutsche bank securities inc  in exchange for  in cash 
since its initial offering of  units  usso has not registered any subsequent offerings of its units 
as of december   usso had issued  units   of which were outstanding 
as of december   there were  units registered but not yet issued 
more units may have been issued by usso than are outstanding due to the redemption of units 
unlike funds that are registered under the act  units that have been redeemed by usso cannot be resold by usso 
as a result  usso contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the sec in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions 
for the year ended december  compared to the period ended december  since usso commenced operations on september   the comparison of usso s results of operations for the year ended december  and the period of september  to december  may not be meaningful 
as of december   the total unrealized loss on short positions in futures contracts owned or held on that day was  and usso established cash deposits  including cash investments in money market funds that were equal to  usso held of its cash assets in overnight deposits and money market funds at the custodian  while of the cash balance was held as margin deposits for usso s short positions in the futures contracts 
the ending per unit nav on december  was 
by comparison  as of december   the total unrealized loss on short positions in futures contracts owned or held on that day was  and usso established cash deposits  including cash investments in money market funds that were equal to  usso held of its cash assets in overnight deposits and money market funds at the custodian  while of the cash balance was held as margin deposits for usso s short positions in the futures contracts 
the ending per unit nav on december  was 
the decrease in the per unit nav for december  as compared to december  was primarily due to an increase in the price of crude oil futures contracts between the year ended december  and the year ended december  portfolio expenses 
usso s expenses consist of investment management fees  brokerage fees and commissions  certain offering costs  licensing fees  the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements 
the management fee that usso pays to uscf is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of usso 
usso pays uscf a management fee of of its average net assets 
the fee is accrued daily and paid monthly 
during the year ended december   the daily average total net assets of usso were  the management fee incurred by usso during the year amounted to  by comparison  during the period ended december   the daily average total net assets of usso were  the management fee paid by usso during the period amounted to  in addition to the management fee  usso pays all brokerage fees and other expenses  including certain tax reporting costs  licensing fees for the use of intellectual property  ongoing registration or other fees paid to the sec  finra and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering and all legal  accounting  printing and other expenses associated therewith 
the total of these fees and expenses for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the period ended december  was primarily due to the fact that usso was only operating for approximately three months during the period ended december  versus a full twelve months of operations for the year ended december  for the year ended december  and the period ended december   usso did not incur any ongoing registration fees and other expenses relating to the registration and offering of additional units 
during the year ended december  and the period ended december   an expense waiver was in effect which offset certain of the expenses incurred by usso 
the total amount of the expense waiver was  for the year ended december  and  for the period ended december  for the year ended december  and the period ended december   the expenses of usso  including management fees  commissions  and all other expenses  before allowance for the expense waiver  totaled  and  respectively  and after allowance for the expense waiver  totaled  and  respectively 
usso is responsible for paying its portion of the directors and officers liability insurance of uscf and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf who are also uscf s audit committee members 
usso shares these fees and expenses with usof  usng  usof  uga  usho  usng and usbo based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis 
these fees and expenses for the year ended december  amounted to a total of  for all funds other than usci  and usso s portion of such fees and expenses was  by comparison  for the period ended december   these fees and expenses amounted to a total of  for all funds  and usso s portion of such fees and expenses was the increase in directors fees and expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the period ended december  was due to an increase in the amount of directors and officers liability insurance coverage and the incurrence of the independent directors deferred compensation expense 
effective as of march   uscf obtained directors and officers liability insurance covering all of the directors and officers of uscf 
previously  uscf did not have liability insurance for its directors and officers  instead  the independent directors received a payment in lieu of directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
effective as of april   usso also became responsible for paying its portion of any payments that may become due to the independent directors pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements entered into between the independent directors  uscf and usso  usof  usng  usof  uga  usho  usng and usbo 
usso also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of futures contracts  other crude oil related investments or treasuries 
during the year ended december   total commissions paid to brokers amounted to  by comparison  during the period ended december   total commissions paid to brokers amounted to  the increase in the total commissions paid to brokers for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  was primarily due to the fact that usso was only operating for approximately three months during the period ended december  versus a full twelve months of operations for the year ended december  as an annualized percentage of total net assets  the figure for the year ended december  represents approximately of total net assets 
by comparison  the figure for the period ended december  represented approximately of total net assets 
however  there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters 
the fees and expenses associated with usso s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements  with the exception of certain initial implementation service fees and base service fees which were borne by uscf  are paid by usso 
these costs are estimated to be  for the year ended december  uscf  though under no obligation to do so  agreed to pay certain expenses  to the extent that such expenses exceed basis points of usso s nav  on an annualized basis  through at least june  uscf has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods 
dividend and interest income 
usso seeks to invest its assets such that it holds short positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio 
typically  such investments do not require usso to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase  but rather require usso to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the short position 
as a result  usso retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets  which usso invests in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents 
this includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin  as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with usso s custodian 
the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis 
for the year ended december   usso earned  in dividend and interest income on such cash and or cash equivalents 
based on usso s average daily total net assets  this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 
usso did not purchase treasuries during the year ended december  and held only cash and or cash equivalents during this time period 
by comparison  for the period ended december   usso earned  in dividend and interest income on such cash and or cash equivalents 
based on usso s average daily total net assets  this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 
usso did not purchase treasuries during the period ended december  and held only cash and or cash equivalents during this time period 
interest rates on short term investments  including cash  cash equivalents and treasuries  were lower during the year ended december  compared to the period ended december  as a result  the amount of income earned by usso as a percentage of total net assets was lower during the year ended december  compared to the period ended december  for the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  portfolio expenses 
during the three months ended december   the daily average total net assets of usso were  the management fee incurred by usso during the period amounted to  by comparison  during the three months ended december   the daily average total net assets of usso were  the management fee paid by usso during the period amounted to  in addition to the management fee  usso pays all brokerage fees and other expenses  including certain tax reporting costs  licensing fees for the use of intellectual property  ongoing registration or other fees paid to the sec  finra and any other regulatory agency in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering and all legal  accounting  printing and other expenses associated therewith 
the total of these fees and expenses for the three months ended december  was  as compared to  for the three months ended december  the decrease in expenses for the three months ended december   as compared to the three months ended december   was primarily due to a decrease in the total net assets of usso 
for the three months ended december  and december   usso did not incur any fees or other expenses relating to the registration or offering of additional units 
during the three months ended december  and december   an expense waiver was in effect which offset certain of the expenses incurred by usso

as an annualized percentage of total net assets  the figure for the three months ended december  represents approximately of total net assets 
by comparison  the figure for the three months ended december  represented approximately of total net assets 
however  there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters 
the fees and expenses associated with usso s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements  with the exception of certain initial implementation service fees and base service fees  which were borne by uscf  are paid by usso 
dividend and interest income 
usso seeks to invest its assets such that it holds short positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio 
typically  such investments do not require usso to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase  but rather require usso to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the short position 
as a result  usso retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets  which usso invests in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents 
this includes both the amount on deposit with the futures commission merchant as margin  as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with usso s custodian 
the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents earn income that accrues on a daily basis 
for the three months ended december   usso earned  in dividend and interest income on such cash and or cash equivalents 
based on usso s average daily total net assets  this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 
usso did not purchase treasuries during the three months ended december  and held only cash and or cash equivalents during this time period 
by comparison  for the three months ended december   usso earned  in dividend and interest income on such cash and or cash equivalents 
based on usso s average daily total net assets  this was equivalent to an annualized yield of 
usso did not purchase treasuries during the three months ended december  and held only cash and or cash equivalents during this time period 
interest rates on short term investments  including cash  cash equivalents and treasuries  were approximately the same during the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  as a result  the amount of income earned by usso as a percentage of total net assets did not change during the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  tracking usso s benchmark 
usso s management seeks to manage usso s portfolio such that changes in its average daily nav  on a percentage basis  inversely track  on a percentage basis  the changes in the daily price of the benchmark futures contract  also on a percentage basis 
specifically  usso s management seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of valuation days  the average daily change in usso s nav is within a range of to to of the daily change in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
as an example  if the daily movement of the price of the benchmark futures contract for a particular valuation day time period was per day  usso management would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the nav during that same time period fell between and ie  between and of the benchmark s results 
usso s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of usso s nav equal to the inverse of the nominal price of the current benchmark futures contract or the spot price for light  sweet crude oil 
management believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed futures contracts 
for the valuation days ended december   the inverse of the simple daily change in the benchmark futures contract was  while the simple average daily change in the nav of usso over the same time period was 
the average daily difference was or basis points  where basis point equals of 
as a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the benchmark futures contract  the average error in daily tracking by the nav was  meaning that over this time period usso s tracking error was within the plus or minus range established as its benchmark tracking goal 
the first chart below shows the daily movement of usso s nav versus the inverse of the daily movement of the benchmark futures contract for the day valuation period ended december  the second chart below shows the monthly total returns of usso as compared to the inverse of the monthly value of the benchmark futures contract since inception 
since the commencement of the offering of usso units to the public on september  to december   the inverse of the simple daily change in its benchmark futures contract was  while the simple average daily change in the nav of usso over the same time period was 
the average daily difference was or basis points  where basis point equals of 
as a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the benchmark futures contract  the average error in daily tracking by the nav was  meaning that over this time period usso s tracking error was within the plus or minus range established as its benchmark tracking goal

past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of usso versus the inverse of the return of its benchmark futures contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of usso  measured by changes in its nav  versus the expected changes in its nav under the assumption that usso s returns had been exactly inverse to the daily changes in its benchmark futures contract 
for the year ended december   the actual total return of usso as measured by changes in its nav was 
this is based on an initial nav of on december  and an ending nav as of december  of 
during this time period  usso made no distributions to its unitholders 
however  if usso s daily changes in its nav had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily return of the benchmark futures contract  usso would have had an estimated nav of as of december   for a total return over the relevant time period of 
the difference between the actual nav total return of usso of and the expected total return based on the inverse of the changes in the daily return of the benchmark futures contract of was an error over the time period of  which is to say that usso actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage 
management believes that a portion of the difference between the actual return and the expected benchmark return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that usso pays  offset in part by the income that usso collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings 
during the year ended december   usso received dividend and interest income of  which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of for such period 
in addition  during the year ended december   usso also collected  from its authorized purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units 
this income also contributed to usso s actual return 
however  if the total assets of usso continue to increase  management believes that the impact on total returns of these fees from creations and redemptions will diminish as a percentage of the total return 
during the year ended december   usso incurred net expenses of  income from dividends and interest and authorized purchaser collections net of expenses was  which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of for the year ended december  by comparison  for the period ended december   the actual total return of usso as measured by changes in its nav was 
this was based on an initial nav of on september  and an ending nav as of december  of 
during this time period  usso made no distributions to its unitholders 
however  if usso s daily changes in its nav had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily return of the benchmark futures contract  usso would have had an estimated nav of as of december   for a total return over the relevant time period of

pgjpg 
past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results there are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact usso s ability to accurately track its benchmark futures contract 
first  usso may buy or sell its holdings in the then current benchmark futures contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which usso executes the trade 
in that case  usso may pay a price that is higher  or lower  than that of the benchmark futures contract  which could cause the changes in the daily nav of usso to either be too high or too low relative to the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
in  management attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the benchmark futures contract at  or as close as possible to  the end of the day settlement price 
however  it may not always be possible for usso to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact usso s attempt to inversely track the benchmark futures contract over time 
second  usso earns dividend and interest income on its cash and cash equivalents 
usso is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its unitholders and did not make any distributions to unitholders in interest payments  and any other income  were retained within the portfolio and added to usso s nav 
when this income exceeds the level of usso s expenses for its management fee  brokerage commissions and other expenses including ongoing registration fees  licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf  usso will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the nav of usso to track slightly higher than the inverse of the daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
during the year ended december   usso earned  on an annualized basis  approximately on its cash holdings 
it also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of for management fees and approximately in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts  and for other expenses 
the foregoing fees and expenses resulted in a net yield on an annualized basis of approximately and affected usso s ability to track the inverse of the daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
if short term interest rates rise above the current levels  the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease 
conversely  if short term interest rates were to decline  the amount of error created by the yield would increase 
when short term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions  then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the nav to underperform the daily returns of the benchmark futures contract 
third  usso may hold other crude oil related investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the inverse of the benchmark futures contract s total return movements 
in that case  the error in tracking the benchmark futures contract could result in daily changes in the nav of usso that are either too high  or too low  relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
during the year ended december   usso did not hold any other crude oil related investments 
if usso increases in size  and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits  usso may invest in crude oil related investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error 
term structure of crude oil futures prices and the impact on total returns 
several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position 
one factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract 
for example  if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market  then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration 
conversely  if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract a situation referred to as contango in the futures market  then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration 
as an example  assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery the spot price  was per barrel  and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also over time  the price of a barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors  including demand for oil relative to its supply 
the value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors 
if investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the oil  every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract 
if the futures market is in backwardation  eg  when the expected price of crude oil in the future would be less  the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract 
hypothetically  and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price  the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and or cash equivalents  the value of the next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract 
in this example  the value of the investment would tend to rise faster than the spot price of crude oil  or fall slower 
as a result  it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen to after some period of time  while the value of the investment in the futures contract would have risen to  assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed 
similarly  the spot price of crude oil could have fallen to while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen to only over time  if backwardation remained constant  the difference would continue to increase 
if the futures market is in contango  the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract 
hypothetically  and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price  the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and or cash equivalents  the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract 
in this example  it would mean that the value of the investment would tend to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil  or fall faster 
as a result  it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen to after some period of time  while the value of the investment in the futures contract will have risen to only  assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed 
similarly  the spot price of crude oil could have fallen to while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen to over time  if contango remained constant  the difference would continue to increase 
the chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the average price of the near month contracts over the last years for light  sweet crude oil 
when the price of the near month contract is higher than the average price of the near month contracts  the market would be described as being in backwardation 
when the price of the near month contract is lower than the average price of the near month contracts  the market would be described as being in contango 
although the prices of the near month contract and the average price of the near month contracts do tend to move up or down together  it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the average price of the near month contracts backwardation  and other times they are below the average price of the near month contracts contango 

pgjpg 
past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the average dollar price of the near month contracts for light  sweet crude oil from the dollar price of the near month contract for light  sweet crude oil 
if the resulting number is a positive number  then the near month price is higher than the average price of the near months and the market could be described as being in backwardation 
if the resulting number is a negative number  then the near month price is lower than the average price of the near months and the market could be described as being in contango 
the chart below shows the results from subtracting the average dollar price of the near month contracts from the near month price for the year period between and

past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an investment in a portfolio that involved owning only the near month contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near months worth of contracts 
generally speaking  when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation  the near month only portfolio would tend to have a higher total return than the month portfolio 
conversely  if the crude oil futures market was in contango  the portfolio containing months worth of contracts would tend to outperform the near month only portfolio 
the chart below shows the annual results of owning a portfolio consisting of the near month contract and a portfolio containing the near months worth of contracts 
in addition  the chart shows the annual change in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
in this example  each month  the near month only portfolio would sell the near month contract at expiration and buy the next month out contract 
the portfolio holding an equal number of the near months worth of contracts would sell the near month contract at expiration and replace it with the contract that becomes the new twelfth month contract 

pgjpg 
past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results as seen in the chart above  there have been periods of both positive and negative annual total returns for both hypothetical portfolios over the last years 
in addition  there have been periods during which the near month only approach had higher returns  and periods where the month approach had higher total returns 
the above chart does not represent the performance history of usso or any affiliated funds 
historically  the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation  with backwardation being in place more often than contango 
during and the first half of  these markets experienced contango 
however  starting early in the third quarter of  the crude oil futures market moved into backwardation 
the crude oil markets remained in backwardation until late in the second quarter of when they moved into contango 
the crude oil markets remained in contango until late in the third quarter of  when the markets moved into backwardation 
early in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved back into contango and remained in contango for the balance of throughout  the crude oil market remained in contango 
during parts of january and february  the level of contango was unusually steep 
crude oil inventories  which reached historic levels in january and february and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango  began to drop in march and continued to drop for the balance of and the beginning of the crude oil futures market remained in contango through the end of periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact usso s investment objective of having the percentage changes in its per unit nav inversely track the percentage changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the percentage changes in price of both usso s units and the benchmark futures contract 
it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future 
it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods 
crude oil market 
during the year ended december   crude oil prices were impacted by several factors 
on the consumption side  demand increased inside and outside the united states as global economic growth  including emerging economies such as china and india  improved during on the supply side  efforts to reduce production by opec to more closely match global consumption were partially successful 
crude oil prices finished approximately higher than at the beginning of the year  though investors looked forward to continued improvements in the global economy 
management believes  however  that should the global economic situation cease to improve  or decline  there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels 
crude oil price movements in comparison to other energy commodities and investment categories 
uscf believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class 
statistically  such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time 
the correlation is scaled between and  where indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together  known as positive correlation  and indicating that they move in completely opposite directions  known as negative correlation 
a correlation of would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively or negatively correlated  known as non correlation 
that is  the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions 
for the ten year time period between and  the chart below compares the monthly movements of crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities  such as natural gas  heating oil and unleaded gasoline  as well as several major non commodity investment asset classes  such as large cap us equities  us government bonds and global equities 
it can be seen that over this particular time period  the movement of crude oil on a monthly basis was not strongly correlated  positively or negatively  with the movements of large cap us equities  us government bonds or global equities 
however  movements in crude oil had a strong positive correlation to movements in heating oil and unleaded gasoline 
finally  crude oil had a positive  but weaker  correlation with natural gas

over the one year period ended december   crude oil continued to have a strong positive correlation with heating oil and unleaded gasoline 
during this period  it also had a weaker correlation with the movements of natural gas compared to what it had displayed over the ten year period ended december  notably  the correlation between crude oil and both large cap us equities and global equities  which had been essentially non correlated over the ten year period ended december   displayed results that indicated that they had a strong positive correlation over this shorter time period  particularly due to the recent upturn in the us and global economies 
finally  the results showed that crude oil and us government bonds  which had essentially been non correlated for the ten year period ended december   were negatively correlated over this more recent time period

bond index global equities ftse world index unleaded gasoline heating oil natural gas crude oil source bloomberg  nymex past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between crude oil and various other energy commodities  as well as other investment asset classes  as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results 
the results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected 
uscf believes that crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time 
however  uscf also believes that in the future it is possible that crude oil could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds 
in addition  uscf believes that  when measured over time periods shorter than ten years  there will always be some periods where the correlation of crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest 
the correlations between crude oil  natural gas  heating oil and gasoline are relevant because uscf endeavors to invest usso s assets in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in usso s nav correlate as closely as possible with the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
if certain other fuel based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the benchmark futures contract  then their use could lead to greater tracking error 
as noted above  uscf also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of light  sweet crude oil 
critical accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
usso s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used 
uscf has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing usso s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments which are not traded on a united states or internationally recognized futures exchange such as forward contracts and over the counter contracts involves a critical accounting policy 
the values which are used by usso for its futures contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available  while over the counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis 
in addition  usso estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents 
these estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference  if any  is not considered material 
liquidity and capital resources usso has not made  and does not anticipate making  use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations 
usso has met  and it is anticipated that usso will continue to meet  its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times 
usso s liquidity needs include redeeming units  providing margin deposits for its existing futures contracts or the purchase of additional futures contracts and posting collateral for its over the counter contracts and  if applicable  and except as noted below  payment of its expenses  summarized below under contractual obligations 
usso currently generates cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and ii income earned on cash and or cash equivalents 
usso has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in crude oil interests 
usso invests in crude oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
a significant portion of usso s nav is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in crude oil interests 
the balance of the net assets is held in usso s account at the custodian 
income received from usso s money market funds is paid to usso 
during the period ended december   usso s expenses exceeded the income usso earned and the cash earned from the sale of creation baskets 
during the year ended december   usso was forced to use other assets to pay cash expenses  which could cause a drop in usso s nav over time 
to the extent expenses exceed income  usso s nav will be negatively impacted 
usso s investments in crude oil interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions  regulatory considerations and other reasons 
for example  most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits 
during a single day  no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit 
once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit  positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit 
such market conditions could prevent usso from promptly liquidating its positions in futures contracts 
during the year ended december   usso was not forced to purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect  however  usso cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future 
prior to the initial offering of usso  all payments with respect to usso s expenses were paid by uscf 
usso does not have an obligation or intention to refund such payments by uscf 
uscf is under no obligation to pay usso s current or future expenses 
since the initial offering of units  usso has been responsible for expenses relating to i management fees  ii brokerage fees and commissions  iii licensing fees for the use of intellectual property  iv ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering  v other expenses  including certain tax reporting costs  vi fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf and vii other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business  while uscf has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of the marketing agent  the administrator and the custodian and offering expenses relating to the initial offering of units 
if uscf and usso are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding  usso will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
market risk trading in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  such as forwards  involves usso entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell crude oil at a specified date in the future 
the aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed usso s future cash requirements since usso intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement 
as a result  usso is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts 
usso considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts 
the market risk associated with usso s commitments to purchase oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held 
however  should usso enter into a contractual commitment to sell oil  it would be required to make delivery of the oil at the contract price  repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash 
since there are no limits on the future price of oil  the market risk to usso could be unlimited 
usso s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors  including the markets for oil  the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the liquidity of the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by usso 
drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital 
credit risk when usso enters into futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations 
the counterparty for the futures contracts traded on the nymex and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange 
in general  in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades  clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and  therefore  this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk 
some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions 
there can be no assurance that any counterparty  clearinghouse  or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to usso in such circumstances 
uscf attempts to manage the credit risk of usso by following various trading limitations and policies 
in particular  usso generally posts margin and or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments it holds 
uscf has implemented procedures that include  but are not limited to  executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of usso to limit its credit exposure 
ubs securities  usso s commodity broker  or any other broker that may be retained by usso in the future  when acting as usso s futures commission merchant in accepting orders to purchase or sell futures contracts on united states exchanges  is required by cftc regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to usso  all assets of usso relating to domestic futures contracts trading 
these futures commission merchants are not allowed to commingle usso s assets with their other assets 
in addition  the cftc requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account usso s assets related to foreign futures contracts trading 
if  in the future  usso purchases over the counter contracts  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k for a discussion of over the counter contracts 
as of december   usso had deposits in domestic and foreign financial institutions  including cash investments in money market funds  in the amount of  this amount is subject to loss should these institutions cease operations 
off balance sheet financing as of december   usso has no loan guarantee  credit support or other off balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business  which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of usso 
while usso s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated  they are not expected to have a material impact on usso s financial position 
redemption basket obligation in order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below  usso requires liquidity to redeem units  which redemptions must be in blocks of  units called redemption baskets 
usso has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of units being redeemed 
contractual obligations usso s primary contractual obligations are with uscf 
in return for its services  uscf is entitled to a management fee calculated monthly as a fixed percentage of usso s nav  currently of nav on its average daily net assets 
uscf agreed to pay the start up costs associated with the formation of usso  primarily its legal  accounting and other costs in connection with uscf s registration with the cftc as a cpo and the registration and listing of usso and its units with the sec  finra and the nyse arca  respectively 
however  since usso s initial offering of units  offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional units of usso have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by usso  and not by uscf 
uscf pays the fees of the marketing agent and the fees of the custodian and transfer agent  bbh co  as well as bbh co 
s fees for performing administrative services  including those in connection with the preparation of usso s financial statements and its sec and cftc reports 
uscf and usso have also entered into a licensing agreement with the nymex pursuant to which usso and the affiliated funds managed by uscf  other than usbo and usci  pay a licensing fee to the nymex 
usso also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements with the exception of certain initial implementation service fees and base service fees which are borne by uscf 
uscf  though under no obligation to do so  agreed to pay certain costs for tax reporting and audit expenses normally borne by usso to the extent that such expenses exceed basis points of usso s nav  on an annualized basis  through at least june  uscf has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods 
in addition to uscf s management fee  usso pays its brokerage fees including fees to a futures commission merchant  over the counter dealer spreads  any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property  and  subsequent to the initial offering  registration and other fees paid to the sec  finra  or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units  as well as legal  printing  accounting and other expenses associated therewith  and extraordinary expenses 
the latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of usso s business  including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the lp agreement  the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation 
commission payments to a futures commission merchant are on a contract by contract  or round turn  basis 
usso also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf 
see note to the notes to financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods  as usso s navs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date 
these agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew  or  in some cases  are in effect for the duration of usso s existence 
either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements 
as of december   usso s portfolio consisted of short crude oil futures cl contracts traded on the nymex

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk over the counter derivatives in the future  usso may purchase over the counter contracts 
unlike most exchange traded futures contracts or exchange traded options on such futures  each party to an over the counter contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract 
some crude oil based derivatives transactions contain fairly generic terms and conditions and are available from a wide range of participants 
other crude oil based derivatives have highly customized terms and conditions and are not as widely available 
many of these over the counter contracts are cash settled forwards for the future delivery of crude oil or petroleum based fuels that have terms similar to the futures contracts 
others take the form of swaps in which the two parties exchange cash flows based on pre determined formulas tied to the spot price of crude oil  forward crude oil prices or crude oil futures prices 
for example  usso may enter into over the counter derivative contracts whose value will be tied to changes in the difference between the spot price of light  sweet crude oil  the price of futures contracts traded on the nymex and the prices of other futures contracts in which usso may invest 
to protect itself from the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts  usso may enter into agreements with each counterparty that provide for the netting of its overall exposure to such counterparty  such as the agreements published by the international swaps and derivatives association  inc usso also may require that the counterparty be highly rated and or provide collateral or other credit support to address usso s exposure to the counterparty 
in addition  it is also possible for usso and its counterparty to agree to clear their transactions under the agreement through an established futures clearinghouse such as those connected to the nymex or the ice futures 
in that event  usso would no longer bear the credit risk of its original counterparty  as the clearinghouse would now be usso s counterparty 
usso would still retain any price risk associated with its transaction and would be required to deposit margin to secure the clearinghouse s exposure to usso 
the creditworthiness of each potential counterparty is assessed by uscf 
uscf assesses or reviews  as appropriate  the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over the counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by the board 
furthermore  uscf on behalf of usso only enters into over the counter contracts with counterparties who are  or are affiliates of  a banks regulated by a united states federal bank regulator  b broker dealers regulated by the sec  c insurance companies domiciled in the united states  or d producers  users or traders of energy  whether or not regulated by the cftc 
any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the united states or the united kingdom unless otherwise approved by the board after consultation with its legal counsel 
existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by uscf 
usso anticipates that the use of other crude oil related investments together with its investments in futures contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of usso 
however  there can be no assurance of this 
over the counter contracts may result in higher transaction related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of futures contracts  which may impact usso s ability to successfully track the benchmark futures contract 
usso may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of inversely tracking the price of the benchmark futures contract 
usso would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset  but with different delivery months 
the effect of holding such combined positions is to adjust the sensitivity of usso to changes in the price relationship between futures contracts which will expire sooner and those that will expire later 
usso would use such a spread if uscf felt that taking such long and short positions  when combined with the rest of its holdings  would more closely track the investment goals of usso  or if uscf felt it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in oil prices 
usso would enter into a straddle when it chooses to take an option position consisting of a long or short position in both a call option and put option 
the economic effect of holding certain combinations of put options and call options can be very similar to that of owning the underlying futures contracts 
usso would make use of such a straddle approach if  in the opinion of uscf  the resulting combination would more closely track the investment goals of usso or if it would lead to an overall lower cost of trading to achieve a given level of economic exposure to movements in oil prices 
during the year ended december   usso did not employ any hedging methods such as those described above since all of its investments were made over an exchange 
therefore  during such period  usso was not exposed to counterparty risk
