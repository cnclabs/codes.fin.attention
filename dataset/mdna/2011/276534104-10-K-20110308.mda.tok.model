item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting polices and estimates 
if we do not accurately establish our premium rates  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in general  the premium rates for our insurance policies are established when coverage is initiated and therefore  before all of the underlying costs are known 
like other insurance companies  we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates 
establishing adequate rates is necessary  together with investment income  to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses  lae and other underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks that we assume  we may fail to charge adequate premium rates to cover our losses and expenses  which could reduce income and cause us to become unprofitable 
as a result  our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums 
in order to set premium rates accurately  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test  and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and recognize changes in trends  project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy  and estimate customer retention 
customer retention represents the amount of exposure a policyholder retains on any one risk or group of risks 
the term may apply to an insurance policy  where the policyholder is an individual  family or business  or a reinsurance policy  where the policyholder is an insurance company 
we must also implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions 
for example  as we expand the geographic market in which we offer our workers compensation insurance products we may not price these products accurately or adequately 
our ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result set premium rates accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including inaccurate assessment of new markets in which we have little or no prior experience  insufficient or unreliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions  our inability to implement appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  costs of ongoing medical treatment  our inability to accurately estimate customer retention  investment yields and the duration of our liability for losses and lae  and unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
consequently  we could set our premium rates too low  which could negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability  or we could set our premium rates too high  which could reduce our ability to obtain new or retain existing business and lead to lower net premiums earned 
if we do not effectively manage the growth of our operations we may not be able to compete or operate profitably 
our growth strategy includes enhancing our market share in our existing markets  entering new geographic markets  introducing new insurance products and programs  further developing our agency relationships  and pursuing merger and acquisition opportunities 
our strategy is subject to various risks  including risks associated with our ability to identify profitable new geographic markets to enter  obtain licenses in new states in which we wish to market and sell our products  successfully implement our underwriting  pricing  claims management  and product strategies over a larger operating region  properly design and price new and existing products and programs and reinsurance facilities  
table of contents identify  train and retain qualified employees  identify  recruit and integrate new independent agents  formulate and execute a merger and acquisition strategy  and augment our internal monitoring and control systems as we expand our business 
we also may encounter difficulties in the implementation of our growth strategies  including unanticipated expenditures 
in addition  our growth strategies may result in us entering into markets or product lines in which we have little or no prior experience 
any such difficulties could result in diversion of senior management time and adversely affect our financial results 
our ability to manage our exposure to underwriting risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance coverage 
we use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain  to stabilize our underwriting results and to increase our underwriting capacity 
although we have not recently experienced difficulty in obtaining reinsurance at reasonable prices  the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to current market conditions and may vary significantly over time 
any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss 
we may be unable to maintain our desired reinsurance coverage or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or obtain new coverage  it will be difficult for us to manage our underwriting risks and operate our business profitably 
it is also possible that the losses we experience on insured risks for which we have obtained reinsurance will exceed the coverage limits of the reinsurance 
if the amount of our reinsurance coverage is insufficient  our insurance losses could increase substantially 
if our reinsurers do not pay our claims in a timely manner  we may incur losses 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to the reinsurers with whom we deal because buying reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to policyholders 
the company had net reinsurance recoverables of million as of december  for example  some of our reinsurers have been adversely impacted by the current economic environment and deterioration in the investment markets and  as a result  have been downgraded by am best  which could negatively impact the reinsurers results of operations or financial condition 
if our reinsurers are not capable of fulfilling their financial obligations to us  including the inability to secure the necessary collateral provided under the reinsurance agreements  our insurance losses would increase  which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our investment performance may suffer as a result of adverse capital market developments  which may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
we invest the premiums we receive from policyholders until cash is needed to pay insured claims or other expenses 
as of december   the company had investments of million 
for the year ended december   the company had million of net investment income  representing of its total revenues 
our investments are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit risk 
in particular  an unexpected increase in the volume or severity of claims may force us to liquidate securities  which may cause us to incur capital losses 
if we do not structure the duration of our investments to match our insurance and reinsurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such payments 
investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base and statutory surplus  thereby affecting our ability to conduct business 
our fixed income securities include investments in state and municipal bonds with an estimated fair value of million as of december  most states and many municipalities are experiencing financial difficulties and budget deficits as a result of the current economic environment and  as a result  the risks associated with our state and municipal bond portfolio have increased 
negative publicity surrounding state and municipality bond issues has resulted in reduced liquidity in the state and municipal bond market 
the reduced market liquidity  as well as rising interest rates  has negatively impacted the estimated fair value of state and municipal bonds 
if the liquidity in the state and municipal bond market does not improve  or worsens  the estimated fair value of the company s state and municipal bonds could decline further 
furthermore  the company may experience an other than temporary impairment if a state or municipality in which the company has an investment defaults on its obligations under the terms of the bond 

table of contents our revenues may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
our investment portfolio contains a significant amount of fixed income securities  including bonds  mortgage backed securities mbss  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and other asset backed securities 
the market values of all of our investments fluctuate depending on economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
the market values of our fixed income securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates rise  fixed income securities generally will decrease in value 
if interest rates decline  these securities generally will increase in value  except for mbss  which may decline due to higher prepayments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
as of december   mbss  including cmos  constituted of the market value of the company s investment portfolio 
mbss and cmos are subject to prepayment risks that vary with  among other things  interest rates 
during periods of declining interest rates  mbss generally prepay faster as the underlying mortgages are prepaid and or refinanced by the borrowers in order to take advantage of lower interest rates 
mbss that have an amortized cost that is greater than par ie  purchased at a premium may incur a reduction in yield or a loss as a result of prepayments 
in addition  during such periods  we generally will be unable to reinvest the proceeds of any prepayment at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the frequency of prepayments generally decreases  and we may receive interest payments that are below the then prevailing interest rate for longer than expected 
mbss that have an amortized cost that is less than par ie  purchased at a discount may incur a decrease in yield or a loss as a result of slower prepayments 
if we fail to comply with insurance industry regulations  or if those regulations become more burdensome  we may not be able to operate profitably 
our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by government agencies in the states in which we conduct business  and we must comply with a number of state and federal laws and regulations 
most insurance regulations are intended to protect the interests of insureds rather than those of shareholders and other investors 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  state insurance departments can exercise a range of remedies from the imposition of fines to being placed in rehabilitation or liquidation 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition  holding company issues and other matters 
these regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives 
part of our strategy includes expanded licensing and product filings for the company 
regulatory authorities  however  have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation of regulations 
if we do not have or obtain the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities  including our expansion objectives  or otherwise penalize us 
furthermore  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations or interpretations of such laws and regulations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are subject to various accounting and financial requirements established by the naic 
eastern re is subject to the laws of the cayman islands and regulations promulgated by the cayman islands monetary authority 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and requirements could result in consequences ranging from a regulatory examination to a regulatory takeover of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries 
this would make our business less profitable 
in addition  state regulators and the naic continually re examine existing laws and regulations  with an emphasis on insurance company solvency issues and fair treatment of policyholders 
insurance laws and regulations could change or additional restrictions could be imposed that are more burdensome and make our business less profitable 
because these laws and regulations are for the protection of policyholders  any changes may not be in your best interest as a shareholder 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business  thus adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
workers compensation insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on many factors 
these factors include the perceived financial strength of the insurer  premiums charged  policy terms and conditions  services provided  reputation  financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies and the experience of the insurer in the line of insurance to be written 
the company s insurance 
table of contents subsidiaries compete with stock insurance companies  mutual companies  local cooperatives and other underwriting organizations 
our principal competitors in the workers compensation insurance market include old republic insurance company  travelers insurance  liberty mutual insurance company  erie insurance group  guard insurance group  penn national insurance company  selective insurance group  cincinnati insurance company  lackawanna insurance group  accident fund insurance company of america  and highmark casualty insurance company 
the workers compensation line of insurance is subject to significant price competition 
if competitors price their products aggressively  our ability to grow or renew our business may be adversely affected 
we pay agents on a commission basis to produce business 
some competitors may offer higher commissions to independent agents or offer insurance at lower premium rates through the use of salaried personnel or other distribution methods that do not rely on independent agents 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business and thereby reduce our profits from operations 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of our key personnel 
the success of our business is dependent  to a large extent  on the efforts of certain key personnel  in particular  michael l 
boguski  our president and chief executive officer  kevin m 
shook  our executive vice president  treasurer and chief financial officer  robert a 
gilpin  our senior vice president of marketing and field operations  and suzanne m 
emmet  our senior vice president of claims and corporate compliance 
we have employment agreements with each of messrs 
boguski  shook  gilpin  and ms 
emmet  which contain covenants not to compete 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of these executives 
the loss of key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to grow  we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and our ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
the current market for qualified insurance personnel is highly competitive 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by any loss of business from key agents and by the creditworthiness of our agents 
our products are marketed by independent agents 
other insurance companies compete with the company for the services and allegiance of these agents 
because they are independent  these agents are not obligated to direct business to the company and may choose to direct business to our competitors  or may direct less desirable risks to us 
the company s ten largest agents in its workers compensation insurance segment accounted for of its direct premiums written for the year ended december  the company s two largest agents  the alliance of central pa  inc and e 
k 
mcconkey  accounted for and of direct premiums written  respectively  for the year ended december  no other agent accounted for more than of direct premiums written in the company s workers compensation insurance segment for the year ended december  if premium volume produced by any of the company s large agents were to decrease significantly  it would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  our customers sometimes pay the premiums for their policies to agents for payment to us 
these premiums are considered paid when received by the agent and  thereafter  the customer is no longer liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the agent 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with our reliance on agents in connection with the collection of insurance premiums 
if we are unable to collect receivables created as a result of our sale of atlantic re and eastern life  we could recognize a loss 
in connection with the sale of atlantic re  a portion of the purchase price consisted of a contingent profit commission of million  payable upon the earlier of extinguishment of all atlantic re s reinsurance obligations  commutation of those obligations  or ten years from the date of closing december  
the amount of the contingent profit commission is based upon the adequacy of the company s loss and lae reserves as of september  compared to a predetermined targeted amount of loss and lae reserves 
the company has recorded a receivable for the contingent profit commission on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  however  the ultimate amount of the contingent profit commission payment is dependent upon the amount of future claims incurred and the ability of the purchaser to manage the outstanding claims  both of which are outside the control of the company 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be collect all or any of the contingent profit commission in the future 
if the company determines at any future date that all or any portion of the contingent profit commission will not be collected  the company will recognize a loss in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents in connection with the sale of eastern life to security life insurance company of america security life  a portion of the purchase price was payable by the delivery to eastern life by security life s parent corporation  security american financial enterprises  inc security american  of a three year million promissory note payable in full at maturity in the ability of security american to repay the promissory note will be dependent upon its financial condition and the financial condition of security life when the note matures 
if security american is unable to repay the note at maturity  or if security american s financial condition deteriorates prior to the maturity date and it is more likely than not that they will be unable to repay the note  the company will incur a loss 
because the company s workers compensation insurance business is concentrated in pennsylvania  the company is subject to local economic risks as well as to changes in the regulatory and legal climate in pennsylvania 
for the year ended december   of the company s workers compensation premium was written in pennsylvania 
the company s workers compensation insurance business is affected by the economic health of pennsylvania for two principal reasons 
first  premium growth is dependent upon payroll growth  which  in turn  is affected by economic conditions 
second  losses and lae can increase in weak economic conditions because it is more difficult to return injured workers to the job when employers are otherwise reducing payrolls 
finally  as a result of the company s high concentration of pennsylvania business  the company can be adversely affected by any material change in pennsylvania law or regulation or any pennsylvania court decision affecting workers compensation carriers generally 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing tax laws may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
financial accounting standards in the united states are constantly under review and may be changed from time to time 
we would be required to apply these changes when adopted 
once implemented  these changes could materially affect our results of operations and or the way in which such results of operations are reported 
similarly  we are subject to taxation in the united states and a number of state jurisdictions 
rates of taxation  definitions of income  exclusions from income  and other tax policies are subject to change over time 
eastern re is domiciled in the cayman islands 
changes in cayman islands tax laws could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
proposals to federally regulate the insurance business could affect our business 
currently  the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies 
these areas include financial services regulation  securities regulation  pension regulation  privacy  tort reform legislation and taxation 
in addition  various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed 
these proposals include the state modernization and regulatory transparency act  which would maintain state based regulation of insurance but would affect state regulation of certain aspects of the insurance business  including rates  agency and company licensing  and market conduct examinations  and the national insurance act of  which would provide for optional federal charters for insurance companies 
we cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or  if enacted  such laws may have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors relating to our common stock directors and management could effectively control certain situations that may be viewed as contrary to your interests 
the extent of management s control over the company is related to the following factors directors and management owned approximately of the company s outstanding stock as of december  the employee stock ownership plan esop owns  or  shares  of the company s outstanding stock as of december  the shares held by the esop will be voted in the manner directed by the esop participants 
we have implemented a stock compensation plan pursuant to which shares of restricted stock and stock options have been issued to certain of our directors  officers and employees 
as a result of these factors  the company s directors and management  directly or indirectly  hold a substantial equity interest in the company 
if all members of management were to act together as a group  they could have a significant influence over the outcome of the election of directors and any other shareholder vote 
therefore  management might have the power to take actions that nonaffiliated shareholders may deem to be contrary to the shareholders best interests 

table of contents provisions in our articles and bylaws and statutory provisions may serve to entrench management and also may discourage takeover attempts that you may believe are in your best interests 
we are subject to provisions of pennsylvania corporate and insurance law that hinder a change of control 
pennsylvania law requires the pennsylvania insurance department s prior approval of a change of control of an insurance holding company 
under pennsylvania law  the acquisition of or more of the outstanding capital stock of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control 
approval by the pennsylvania insurance department may be withheld even if the transaction would be in the shareholders best interest if  among other things  the pennsylvania insurance department determines that the transaction would be detrimental to policyholders 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that may discourage a change in control 
these provisions include a classified board of directors divided into three classes serving for successive terms of three years each  a provision that the board of directors has the authority to issue shares of authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock and to establish the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock  including voting rights  without additional shareholder approval  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors  the requirement that nominations for the election of directors made by shareholders and any shareholder proposals for inclusion on the agenda at any annual meeting must be made by notice in writing delivered or mailed to us not less than days or more than days prior to the meeting  the prohibition of shareholder action without a meeting and the prohibition of shareholders being able to call a special meeting  the requirement that certain provisions of our articles of incorporation can only be amended by an affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least of all votes that shareholders are entitled to cast  unless approved by an affirmative vote of at least of the members of the board of directors  and the requirement that certain provisions of our bylaws can only be amended by an affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least  or in certain cases  of all votes that shareholders are entitled to cast 
these provisions may serve to entrench management and may discourage a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest or in which you would receive a substantial premium over the current market price 
these provisions may make it extremely difficult for any one person or group of affiliated persons to acquire voting control of the company  with the result that it may be extremely difficult to bring about a change in the board of directors or management 
some of these provisions also may perpetuate present management because of the additional time required to cause a change in the control of the board 
other provisions make it difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of the voting stock to be able to elect even a single director 
provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law  which we refer to as the pbcl  that are applicable to publicly traded companies provide  among other things  that we may not engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder during the five year period after the interested shareholder became such  except under certain specified circumstances 
under the pbcl  an interested shareholder is generally a holder of or more of our voting stock 
the pbcl also contains provisions providing for the ability of shareholders to object to the acquisition by a person  or group of persons acting in concert  of or more of our outstanding voting securities and to demand that they be paid a cash payment for the fair value of their shares from the controlling person or group 
if our insurance subsidiaries are not sufficiently profitable  our ability to pay dividends will be limited by regulatory restrictions 
our domestic insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the company is limited by the insurance laws and regulations of pennsylvania and indiana 
the maximum dividend that the domestic insurance entities may pay without prior approval from the pennsylvania insurance department and the indiana insurance department is limited to the greater of of statutory surplus or of statutory net income for the most recently filed annual statement 
eastern re must receive approval from the cayman islands monetary authority before it can pay any dividend 
furthermore  any dividends paid in excess of eastern re s cumulative earnings and profits subsequent to june  would be subject to us federal income tax

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company sold its group benefits insurance business and the majority of its run off specialty reinsurance business 
as a result of these transactions  the company has reported the results of operations of its group benefits insurance and run off specialty reinsurance business as discontinued operations 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   of which million was attributed to discontinued operations 
the company reported net income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net income primarily reflects an increase in the loss ratio from in to in  premiums returned to customers as a result of premium audits  and a decrease in net investment income 
these items  which contributed to the decrease in the company s operating results  were partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned  an increase in realized gains from the sale of investments  a decrease in other than temporary investment impairments  and a decrease in the expense ratio from in to in the increase in the loss ratio primarily reflects a higher accident period loss ratio in both the workers compensation insurance and segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segments as a result of an increase in severity related claims in the workers compensation insurance segment 
the company returned premium to customers as a result of premium audits in  reflecting the impact of the economy on customers payroll 
premiums returned to customers totaled million in  compared to additional premium from customers totaling  in in addition to the impact of changes in audit premium  the company decreased its estimate of earned but unbilled premium by  in while the audit premium had a negative impact on net premiums earned  the company wrote new business of million in and experienced an increase in the renewal retention rate  resulting in an increase in premium revenue from to the decrease in the expense ratio primarily reflects the impact of the premium revenue increase 
the company experienced growth in each of its geographical markets during  and particularly in its southeast market 
the expense ratio was also positively impacted by the release of the and accruals related to the pennsylvania workers compensation security fund assessment 
principal revenue and expense items the company derives its revenue primarily from net premiums earned  including assumed premiums earned  net investment income and net realized investment gains 
direct and net premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
direct premiums written include all premiums billed during a specified policy period 
net premiums written is the difference between direct premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers ceded premiums written 
in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment  assumed premiums are derived from insurance contracts written by the company and ceded to the segregated portfolio cells 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned represent the earned portion of the company s net premiums written 
premiums are earned over the term of the related policies 
at the end of each accounting period  the portion of the premiums that are not yet earned are included in unearned premiums and are realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
the company s workers compensation policies typically have a term of twelve months 
thus  for example  for a policy that is written on july   one half of the premiums would be earned in and the other half would be earned in workers compensation premiums are determined based upon the payroll of the insured  the applicable premium rates and  where applicable  an experience based modification factor 
an audit of the policyholders records is conducted after policy expiration to make a final determination of applicable premiums 
included with net premiums earned is an estimate for earned but unbilled final audit premiums 
the company can estimate earned but unbilled premiums because it keeps track  by policy  of how much additional premium is billed in final audit invoices as a percentage to estimate the probable additional amount that it has earned but not yet billed as of the balance sheet date 
net investment income and realized gains and losses on investments 
the company invests its surplus and the funds supporting its insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and lae in cash  cash equivalents  fixed income securities  convertible bonds and equity securities

the company recognizes realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost in the case of fixed income securities and recognizes realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost 
realized gains and losses also include the change in fair value of convertible bonds 
other revenue 
other revenue includes claim administration  risk management  and cell rental fees earned 
there are other revenue items that the company recognizes on a segmental basis that are eliminated in consolidation 
such items consist primarily of fees paid by the segregated portfolio cells to other entities within the consolidated group 
the segregated portfolio cells recognize an expense for such items included as part of its ceding commission and a corresponding revenue item is recognized by the affiliate providing the service 
for segment reporting purposes  such revenue items primarily include claims administration  risk management  and cell rental fees 
fronting fees are included in acquisition and other underwriting expenses as an offset to the direct costs incurred 
for segment reporting purposes  such fees are recognized ratably over the period in which the service is provided  which generally corresponds to the earned portion of net premiums written for the underlying policies 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and lae  acquisition and other underwriting expenses  policyholder dividends  other expenses  and income taxes 
losses and lae 
losses and lae represent the largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods  and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
acquisition and other underwriting expenses 
in the workers compensation insurance segment  expenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as acquisition and other underwriting expenses  which consist primarily of commissions  premium taxes  assessments and fees and other underwriting expenses incurred in acquiring  writing and administering the company s business 
in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance  acquisition and other underwriting expenses consist of ceding commissions earned under the respective reinsurance agreements 
ceding commissions received are netted against acquisition and other underwriting expenses 
other expenses 
other expenses consist of general administrative expenses such as salaries  rent  office supplies  depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately 
policyholder dividend expense 
policyholder dividends represent the amount of dividends incurred during the period that are expected to be returned to policyholders 
the dividend expense is based on the loss experience of the underlying workers compensation insurance policy 
income tax expense 
eihi and certain of its subsidiaries pay federal  state and local income taxes 
income tax expense includes an amount for both current and deferred income taxes 
current income tax expense includes an amount for the company s current year federal income tax liability and any adjustments related to differences between the prior year federal income tax estimate and the actual income tax expense reported in the federal income tax return 
deferred tax expense represents the change in the company s net deferred tax asset  exclusive of the tax effect related to changes in unrealized gains and losses in the company s investment portfolio and changes in the unrecognized amounts related to the company s benefit plan liabilities 
key financial measures the company evaluates its insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability 
the company measures growth by monitoring changes in direct premiums written and net premiums written 
the company measures underwriting profitability by examining loss  expense  policyholder dividend expense and combined ratios 
on a segmental basis  the company measures a segment s operating results by examining net income  diluted earnings per share  and return on average equity 
loss ratio 
the loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned and measures the underwriting profitability of a company s insurance business 
the company measures the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability 
an accident year loss ratio measures losses and lae for insured events occurring in a particular policy year  regardless of when they are reported  as a percentage of net premiums earned during that year 
a calendar year loss ratio measures losses and lae for insured events occurring during a particular policy year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of net premiums earned during that year 

table of contents expense ratio 
the expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of the sum of the acquisition and other underwriting expenses  other expenses and amortization of intangibles to net premiums earned  and measures the company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
policyholder dividend expense ratio 
the policyholder dividend expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of policyholder dividend expense to net premiums earned and measures the impact of the company s policyholder dividend policies on its workers compensation insurance segment 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  expense ratio and policyholder dividend expense ratio and measures the company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is below  the company is making an underwriting profit 
if the company s combined ratio is at or above  the company is not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio 
the net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
this ratio measures the company s insurance subsidiaries exposure to pricing errors in its current book of business 
the higher the ratio  the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate 
net income  diluted earnings per share  and return on average equity 
the company uses net income and diluted earnings per share to measure its profits and return on average equity to measure its effectiveness in utilizing shareholders equity to generate net income 
in determining return on average equity for a given year  net income is divided by the average of the beginning and ending shareholders equity for that year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies 
the company is required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to the estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the company believes the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae the company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and lae for its workers compensation insurance and segregated portfolio cell reinsurance products  which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses 
the adequacy of the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount that the company may pay under many of the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years 
establishing reserves is an imprecise process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
the company s estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data becomes available and are reviewed as new or improved methodologies are developed  or as current laws change 
any such revisions could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables and would be reflected in the company s results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed 
estimating the ultimate claims liability is necessarily a complex and judgmental process inasmuch as the amounts are based on management s informed estimates and judgments using data currently available 
if the company s ultimate losses  net of reinsurance  prove to differ substantially from the amounts recorded as of december   the related adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
workers compensation insurance on a quarterly basis  the company prepares actuarial analyses to assess the reasonableness of the recorded reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation insurance segment 
these actuarial analyses incorporate various methodologies  including paid loss development  incurred loss development and a combination of other actuarial methodologies that incorporate characteristics of incurred and paid methodologies combined with a review of the company s exposure base 
the recorded amount in each accident year is then compared to the results of these methodologies  with consideration being given to the age of the accident year 
as accident years mature  the various methodologies generally 
table of contents produce consistent loss estimates 
for more recent accident years  the methodologies produce results that are not as consistent 
accordingly  more emphasis is placed on supplementing the methodologies in more recent accident years with trends in exposure base  medical expense inflation  general inflation  severity  and claim counts  among other things 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation insurance segment as of december  and are summarized below in thousands case reserves case incurred development  ibnr and unallocated lae reserves amount of discount net reserves before reinsurance recoverables and purchase accounting reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae purchase accounting adjustments reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation insurance segment  the company records reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies and for lae related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae represent the estimated cost of reported and unreported losses and lae incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing its workers compensation reserves  the company uses loss discounting  which involves recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
when a claim is reported  the company s claims adjusters establish a case reserve  which consists of anticipated medical costs  indemnity costs and certain defense and cost containment expenses that the company refers to as allocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae 
at any point in time  the amount paid on a claim  plus the case reserve for future amounts to be paid  represents the claims adjuster s estimate at that time of the total cost of the claim  or the case incurred amount 
the case reserve for each reported claim is based upon various factors  including type of loss  severity of the injury or damage  age and occupation of the injured employee  estimated length of temporary disability  anticipated permanent disability  expected medical procedures  costs and duration  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  insurance policy provisions  including coverage  related to the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  and other benefits defined by applicable statute 
the case incurred amount can vary over time due to changes in expectations with respect to medical treatment and outcome  length and degree of disability  employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations 
as changes occur  the case incurred amount is adjusted 
the initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid  especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment 
changes in case incurred amounts  or case incurred development  is an important component of the company s historical claim data 
in addition to case reserves  the company establishes loss and alae reserves on an aggregate basis for case incurred development and ibnr claims 
case incurred development and ibnr reserves are primarily intended to provide for aggregate changes in preexisting case incurred amounts and  secondarily  to provide for the unpaid cost of ibnr claims for which an initial case reserve has not been established 
the third component of the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae is unallocated loss adjustment expense  or ulae 
the company s ulae reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for known and unknown claims 
the company s ulae reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims 

table of contents in estimating case incurred development and ibnr reserves  the company performs most of its detailed analysis on a net of reinsurance basis  and then considers expected recoveries in arriving at its recorded amounts for unpaid losses and lae 
to estimate such reserves  the company relies primarily on the historical claim data and trends from its workers compensation book of business 
using standard actuarial methods  the company estimates reserves based on historical patterns of case development  payment patterns  mix of business  premium rates charged  case reserving adequacy  operational changes  adjustment philosophy and severity and duration trends 
however  the number of variables and judgments involved in establishing reserve estimates  combined with some random variation in loss development patterns  results in uncertainty regarding projected ultimate losses 
to estimate reserves  the company stratifies its data using variations of the following different categorizations of claims all loss and lae data developed together  lost time claims developed independently  medical only claims developed independently  the indemnity portion of lost time claims developed independently  the medical portion of a lost time claim and medical only claims developed together  and lae developed independently 
the term developed together refers to the summation of the claims data for a particular data stratification 
for example  all loss and lae data developed together represents all loss and lae data of the company  regardless of medical  indemnity or expense components  developed together using the historical data for this particular data stratification 
the term developed independently refers to a specific data element 
for example  the indemnity portion of lost time claims developed independently represents the development of the indemnity portion of a claim separately using historical data for this particular type of claim 
developing claims using different data stratifications allows the company to identify trends for a specific group of claims that would not necessarily be readily identifiable if the data were included with other types of claim information 
for example  developing the medical portion of a claim separately may allow the company to identify a medical inflation trend that may not have been evident if it had been included with indemnity claim information 
the combination of the different data stratifications and standard actuarial methods  including the following  produce different actuarial indications for the company to evaluate incurred loss development method 
the incurred case incurred loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
age to age loss development factors ldfs are calculated to measure the relative development of an accident year from one maturity point to the next 
paid loss development method 
the paid loss development method relies on paid losses to estimate ultimate losses and is mechanically identical to the incurred loss development method described above 
the paid method does not rely on case reserves or claim reporting patterns in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a paid loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  legal changes or variations in a company s mix of business from one year to the next 
also  since the percentage of losses paid for immature years is often low  development factors are more volatile 
a small variation in the number of claims paid can have a leveraging effect that can lead to significant changes in estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae 
therefore  ultimate values for immature accident years are often based on alternative estimation techniques 
bornhuetter ferguson methodology 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected ultimate losses rather than a function of the currently reported losses 
the expected ultimate losses in this analysis are based on historical results  adjusted for known pricing changes and inflationary trends 
the expected ultimate losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected cumulative incurred ldfs 
finally  the unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature accident years 
for these immature accident years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns distort historical development of losses 

table of contents the bornhuetter ferguson method can also be applied with paid losses 
in estimating ulae reserves  the company reviews past loss adjustment expenses in relation to paid claims and estimated future costs based on expected claims activity and duration 
the sum of the company s net loss and alae reserve and ulae reserves represents its total net reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
in determining management s best estimate  the company considers the various accident year loss indications produced by the actuarial methods 
considering the results of the methods  the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each method as described above  as well as other statistical information such as ultimate loss ratios  ultimate loss to exposure ratios and average ultimate claim values  the company determines and records its best estimate of unpaid losses and alae 
management believes its best estimate of recorded reserves for unpaid losses and lae is representative of the inherent uncertainty surrounding reserving for a long tail line of business such as workers compensation as well as the relative immature accident year historical experience of its workers compensation insurance segment  which completed its first full year of operations in as of december   the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers and before purchase accounting adjustments  for its workers compensation insurance segment was million 
for each of the methods described above that are used to estimate reserves for losses and lae  the estimated paid and incurred loss development factors are key assumptions 
loss development factors are estimated based on the company s historical paid and incurred loss development patterns  and an estimate of the tail factor  or a factor to account for development beyond the maturity of the historical data 
in addition  for the bornhuetter ferguson methods  a key assumption is an estimate of the expected loss ratio 
the expected loss ratio is determined based on estimated historical loss ratios adjusted to reflect current underwriting and rate change activity 
the assumptions used in these methods by the company over time have reflected a consistent application of the company s estimating processes to emerging experience 
the tail factors used in the calculation of loss development factors requires considerable judgment 
selecting representative tail factors requires substantially more judgment than the historical loss development factors 
while loss development factors are based on the historical claim payment and reserving patterns of the company over a period of time  tail factors are estimated based on loss development trends in more mature accident years and industry information  and therefore are estimated in the absence of direct historical loss development history 
management believes that changes in tail factors are reasonably likely considering the impact that changing economic conditions and medical inflation may have on the loss and lae estimation process 
there are loss and lae risk factors that affect workers compensation claims that can change over time and also cause the company s loss reserves to fluctuate 
some examples of these risk factors include  but are not limited to  the following recovery time from the injury  degree of patient responsiveness to treatment  use of pharmaceutical drugs  type and effectiveness of medical treatments  frequency of visits to healthcare providers  changes in costs of medical treatments  availability of new medical treatments and equipment  types of healthcare providers used  availability of light duty for early return to work  attorney involvement  wage inflation in states that index benefits  and changes in administrative policies of second injury funds 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and the corresponding reserves for unpaid losses and lae estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors that are known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly 
in most instances  we rely on historical 
table of contents experience and tail factors to estimate values for the variables that are explicitly used in the unpaid loss and lae analysis 
for the most recent accident year  we rely on selecting an expected loss ratio to estimate the reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
in addition to the examples above that represent reasonably likely changes in our tail factor  another example of potential variability in our loss and lae estimation process involves selecting an expected loss ratio for the most recent accident year 
for example  if our expected loss ratio for the accident year were to increase by percentage points  our reserves for unpaid losses and lae as of december  would increase by million  which would result in an after tax reduction in our earnings of million 
management believes that changes in the most recent year accident year loss ratio are reasonably likely due to variability in underwriting and rate changes 
it is important to note that actual claims costs will vary from our estimate of ultimate claim costs  perhaps by substantial amounts  due to the inherent variability of the business written  the potentially significant claim settlement lags and the fact that not all events affecting future claim costs can be estimated 
in the event that our estimates of ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and lae prove to be greater or less than the ultimate liability  our future earnings and financial position could be positively or negatively impacted 
future earnings would be reduced by the amount of any deficiencies in the year s in which the claims are paid or the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are increased 
for example  if we determined our reserves for unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  of million as of december  to be inadequate  this would result in an after tax reduction in our earnings of approximately million 
this reduction could be realized in one year or multiple years  depending on when the deficiency is identified 
the deficiency would also impact our financial position because our statutory surplus would be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in net income 
any deficiency is typically recognized in the reserves for unpaid losses and lae and  accordingly  it typically does not have a material effect on our liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
since the claims will typically be paid out over a multi year period  we have generally been able to adjust our investments to match the anticipated future claim payments 
conversely  if our estimates of ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and lae prove to be redundant  our future earnings and financial position would be improved 
the company has utilized the following tail factors for the years ended december    and incurred loss development paid loss development following is a sensitivity analysis of the company s workers compensation reserves to reasonably likely changes in the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses dollars in thousands change in tail factor assumption increase decrease in net reserves impact on net income percentage of shareholders equity basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease basis point decrease the estimates above rely on substantial judgment 
there is inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
it is possible that the actual losses and lae incurred may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
segregated portfolio cell reinsurance the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment as of december  and are summarized below in thousands case reserves case incurred development  ibnr and unallocated lae reserves amount of discount net reserves before reinsurance recoverables and purchase accounting reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae purchase accounting adjustments reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
table of contents the company estimates and records reserves for its segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment in the same manner as for its workers compensation insurance segment 
the reporting and paid loss development patterns in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment are also consistent with that of the workers compensation insurance segment 
accordingly  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered in the company s segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment require considerable judgment 
the difference between total revenue for the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment for each period and the sum of losses and lae  acquisition and other underwriting expenses  policyholder dividend expense and other expenses is accrued as a segregated portfolio dividend expense 
accordingly  any change in the reserve for unpaid losses and lae is recorded to the segregated portfolio dividend payable receivable account and would only impact the company s net income or shareholders equity if the company were a segregated portfolio cell dividend participant 
other than temporary investment impairments unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income loss and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
when  in the opinion of management  a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost or amortized cost is considered to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its fair value 
the amount written down is recorded in earnings as a realized loss on investments 
generally  the determination of other than temporary impairment includes  in addition to other relevant factors  a presumption that if the market value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time  a write down is necessary 
notwithstanding this presumption  the determination of other than temporary impairment requires judgment about future prospects for an investment and is therefore a matter of inherent uncertainty 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded other than temporary impairments  excluding impairments in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment  of  million and million  respectively 
other than temporary impairments in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment totaled   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   the company held fixed income securities  excluding fixed income securities in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment  with gross unrealized losses of  of which  were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
there were no equity securities in an unrealized loss position as of december  adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in impairment charges in the future 
the company generally applies the following standards in determining whether the decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary equity securities 
an equity security is considered impaired when one of the following conditions exist an equity security s market value is less than of its cost for a continuous period of months  an equity security s market value is less than of its cost  regardless of the amount of time the security s market value has been below cost  and an equity security s market value has been less than cost for a continuous period of months or more  regardless of the magnitude of the decline in market value 
equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position  but do not meet the above quantitative thresholds are evaluated to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded other than temporary impairments of  million  and million  respectively  related to its equity security portfolio 
the securities were impaired because they had been in an unrealized loss position for more than months 
fixed income securities 
a fixed income security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired when the security s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis and the company intends to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis  or the company believes it will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security ie  a credit loss has occurred 
when the company determines a credit loss has been incurred  but the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis  the portion of the other than temporary impairment that is credit related is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  and the portion of the other than temporary impairment that is not credit related is included in other comprehensive income loss 
a fixed income security is reviewed for potential credit loss if any of the following situations occur a review of the financial condition and prospects of the issuer indicates that the security should be evaluated  moody s or standard poor s rate the security below investment grade  or the security has a market value below of amortized cost due to deterioration in credit quality 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  the company recorded other than temporary impairments of   and  respectively  related to its fixed income security portfolio 
limited partnerships 
a limited partnership investment is generally written down if the company is unable to hold or otherwise intends to sell its interest in the limited partnership at a loss  or if management has received information that suggests the company will be unable to recover its original investment in the limited partnership 
the amount written down is recorded in the change in equity interest in limited partnerships in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
there were no impairments related to the company s limited partnership investments in or for the year ended december   the company recorded a permanent impairment of million related to one of its limited partnership investments 
at the time a security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired  the cost or amortized cost is written down to market value at the balance sheet date and the impairment is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill in accordance with the requirements of asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is at the operating segment level or one level below an operating segment 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances change  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition 
the company has allocated of the goodwill recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  to its workers compensation insurance segment 
the goodwill impairment test  performed as of september of each year  is a two step test 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
for the annual impairment test  the fair value of the workers compensation insurance segment was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach  using management s internal four year forecast for the workers compensation insurance segment and a terminal value estimated using a long term growth rate of  which is reflective of the segment s historical growth rate  and a discount rate of  which is reflective of the risks inherent in the segment 
cash flows were adjusted as necessary to maintain adequate capital requirements 
the discounted cash flow analysis resulted in the workers compensation insurance segment s estimated fair value exceeding its carrying value as of september   therefore  goodwill was considered not impaired  and the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 
in the event the operating results of the company s workers compensation insurance segment were to be adversely impacted by a significant loss of business or higher than expected losses and lae  management s internal forecast may need to be re evaluated  which could result in a fair value that is less than the carrying value of the workers compensation insurance segment and the need to recognize a goodwill impairment 
deferred income taxes the temporary differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities are recorded as deferred income taxes 
management evaluates the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset based on historical trends of generating taxable income or losses  as well as expectations of future taxable income or loss 
as of december   the company recorded a net deferred tax asset of  management expects that the net deferred tax asset is fully recoverable 
if this assumption were to change  any amount of the net deferred tax asset that the company could not expect to recover would be provided for as an allowance and would be reflected as an increase in income tax expense in the period in which it was established 

table of contents as of december   the company recognized a deferred tax asset of million related to other than temporary investment impairments 
under united states federal income tax rules and regulations  capital losses can only be utilized to offset income generated from capital gains 
capital losses can be carried back to offset capital gains reported in the three prior tax periods and can be carried forward for five tax periods 
management has determined  based on a review of its investment portfolio and giving consideration to capital gains reported in prior tax periods  that the company s deferred tax asset related to other than temporary investment impairments and net unrealized losses on investments is recoverable  therefore  a valuation allowance has not been recorded as of december  due to the significant volatility in the investment markets  management s conclusion on the recoverability of the deferred tax asset could change in future periods 
further declines in the estimated fair value of the company s investments may result in the need for a valuation allowance  which could have an adverse impact of the company s financial condition and or results of operations 
reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from company s reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reserves for unpaid losses and lae associated with the reinsured policy 
amounts paid for reinsurance contracts are expensed over the contract period during which insured events are covered by the reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and lae are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the appropriate liabilities  because reinsurance does not relieve the company of its legal liability to its policyholders 
reinsurance balances recoverable are subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
additionally  the same uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid losses and lae affect the estimates for the ceded portion of these liabilities 
the company continually monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and where necessary obtains collateral 
as of december   the company had reinsurance recoverables of million 
recent accounting pronouncements deferred acquisition costs in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the accounting for costs related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts 
the new guidance provides specific types of costs that should be capitalized in connection with the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts 
those costs include incremental direct costs of contract acquisition incurred in connection with independent third parties and certain costs related to activities performed by the insurer for the contract  including underwriting  policy issuance and processing  medical and inspection  and sales force contract selling 
under the new guidance  costs incurred by an entity related to unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts must be charged to expense as incurred 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
retrospective application to all prior periods upon the date of adoption is permitted  but not required 
early adoption is permitted but only at the beginning of an entity s annual reporting period 
the company currently capitalizes and defers commissions and related expenses  premium taxes and certain underwriting personnel salaries 
the company expects to adopt this new guidance effective january  and apply it retrospectively to prior periods for purposes of consistency across all periods presented 
upon adoption  the company expects to reduce the amount of acquisition costs capitalized related to certain underwriting personnel salaries to give effect to unsuccessful acquisition or renewal activities 
management does not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a material effect of the company s financial condition or results of operations 
fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new guidance requires the following new or enhanced disclosures details of significant transfers in and out of level and level measurements and the reasons for the transfers  a gross presentation of activity within the level rollforward  presenting separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  and fair value disclosures must be presented by class of assets and liabilities rather than by major category 
the new guidance was effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level rollforward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim periods within those years 
the company adopted the new accounting guidance effective january  the adoption of the new guidance resulted in enhanced disclosures related to the company s fair value measurements of its investments 

table of contents variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to variable interest entities 
the new guidance replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative  requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
the new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted the new accounting guidance effective january  the adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

for the years ended december   and  the company s cash inflows from premiums and investment activity were sufficient to support the company s cash outflows related to claims and operating expenses 
management expects future cash flows from operations in its workers compensation insurance and segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segments to be sufficient to cover claims and operating expenses

contractual commitments the following table summarizes information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments 
the minimum payments under these agreements as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years real estate lease obligation loss reserves total contractual obligations the payments related to the loss reserves are shown before purchase accounting adjustments of the loss reserves payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and lae reserves estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns by line of business 
as a result  our calculation of loss reserve payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see item business  loss and lae reserves 
actual payments of loss and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of loss reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting the company are credit risk  interest rate risk  and equity risk 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
the company addresses this risk by investing primarily in fixed income securities which are rated a or higher by standard poor s 
the company also independently  and through the company s outside investment manager  monitors the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed income securities in the portfolio 
to limit the company s exposure to risk  the company employs diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic loss due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company had fixed income investments  excluding convertible bonds and fixed income securities in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment  with an estimated fair value of million at december   that are subject to interest rate risk 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate risk through an asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of the company s liability and capital position 

table of contents the table below summarizes the company s interest rate risk 
it illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio  excluding the company s convertible bond portfolio and fixed income securities in the segregated cell reinsurance segment  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio and shareholders equity dollars in thousands 
hypothetical change in interest rates estimated change in fair value estimated fair value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in shareholders equity  net of tax basis point increase basis point increase basis increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease equity risk 
equity risk is the risk that the company may incur economic loss due to adverse changes in equity prices 
the company s exposure to changes in equity prices primarily results from its holdings of exchange traded funds and other equities 
the company s portfolio of equity securities is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
impact of inflation inflation rates may impact the company s financial condition and operating results in several ways 
fluctuations in rates of inflation influence interest rates  which in turn affect the market value of the investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
inflation also affects the portion of losses and loss reserves that relates to hospital and medical expenses and property claims and loss adjustment expenses  but not the portion of losses and loss reserves that relates to workers compensation indemnity payments for lost wages  which are fixed by statute 
adjustments for inflationary effects are included as part of the continual review of loss reserve estimates 
increased costs are considered in setting premium rates  and this is particularly important in the health care area where hospital and medical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are affected to a certain degree by the inflation rate
