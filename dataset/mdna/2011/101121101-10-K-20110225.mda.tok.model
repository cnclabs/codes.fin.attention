overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc  san francisco and princeton  nj 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions  current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors 
from time to time  we also generate cash through the sale of assets 
our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants 
historically  this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve 
while the high rate 
table of contents of unemployment continues to negatively impact the fundamentals of our business in many of our markets  we believe that rental rates in all of our markets have stabilized and we are seeing gradual improvement in select submarkets 
to be successful in the current leasing environment  we believe all aspects of the tenant landlord relationship must be considered 
in this regard  we believe that our understanding of tenants short and long term space needs in the local markets  our relationships with local brokers  our reputation as a premier owner and operator of class a office properties  our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage in an increasingly fragmented office market 
additionally  the premier locations and high caliber of our assets are resulting in increased leasing activity as we are seeing a flight to quality by office tenants 
in we signed leases for more than million square feet of space  which exceeds by approximately million square feet our annual average over the past five years  and we are seeing improvements in market economics in new york city and other isolated submarkets 
nevertheless  we continue to believe that general office market conditions are dependent on the impact of a recovery in the labor markets  and we are therefore not predicting significant rental rate growth or markedly fewer landlord concessions in the near term 
as of december   leases representing approximately of the space at our properties expire during while rental rates in our markets appear to have stabilized  as leases expire  assuming no change in current market rental rates  we expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new leases will generally be less than the rates currently being paid  thereby generally resulting in less revenue from the same space 
for example  we estimate that the average rent currently paid by our office tenants for leases that expire during is approximately greater than current market rates for comparable space 
because the individual labor and industry markets may recover at different paces  we may see varying degrees of strength or softness in our core markets 
we expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high quality space like ours  particularly those who value our operational expertise and financial stability when making their leasing decisions 
current market conditions  characterized by overleveraged real estate assets and property owners with insufficient capital resources  have provided opportunities for well capitalized companies and seasoned operators  such as us  to acquire high quality assets 
over the past six months  we acquired three class a office properties that we had been monitoring and evaluating for some time  which are madison avenue in new york city  the john hancock tower in boston and bay colony corporate center in waltham  massachusetts 
each of these properties was for sale because of the aggressive capital structures used to develop or purchase them during the last economic cycle when high leverage debt capital was readily available 
we believe these acquisitions present attractive opportunities for long term value creation through the use of our operational  managerial and financial strength 
the acquisition of the approximately  square foot iconic john hancock tower will strengthen our foothold in boston s back bay office market 
in addition  bay colony corporate center  an approximately  square foot  four building office park that has undergone four ownership changes over the past few years  has experienced deteriorating occupancy and has recently received minimal capital investment 
these factors combined with its strong location and historical reputation as one of the premier suburban boston office addresses present an attractive repositioning and leasing opportunity for a developer and manager such as us 
finally  madison avenue  an approximately  square foot office building that is under development  had been largely ignored by the leasing community due to its uncertain ownership status 
our initial leasing activity has been stronger than expected and we continue to generate positive interest in the building 
we believe other acquisition opportunities like those discussed above will continue to present themselves in however  potential buyers have also become more aggressive about expectations for a recovery as evidenced by the high level of interest we are seeing in marketed assets 
the combination of relatively low interest rates and the abundance of capital seeking high quality assets may have a dampening effect on return expectations 
while our management team is actively seeking opportunities  we will maintain our disciplined investment strategy  which focuses on high quality assets in supply constrained markets that have historically 
table of contents provided long term value creation 
as we seek to deploy capital in  we also expect to actively market some selected assets for sale 
we structured the acquisition of the john hancock tower as a reverse like kind exchange  which is intended to provide us the flexibility to sell certain assets and retain capital for future investments or the reduction of debt 
we are currently evaluating market interest in a sale of all or a significant interest in our carnegie center portfolio and may identify other assets for potential sale in given the recent low interest rate environment and the opportunity to further enhance our capital position and elongate our debt maturity schedule  we have also been active in the capital markets 
since january   five of our joint ventures have refinanced approximately million in secured financings 
in april  our operating partnership completed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  and in november  our operating partnership completed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds of the november offering to reduce a significant portion of our near term debt maturities 
specifically  we redeemed million of our operating partnership s senior notes due and we repurchased million of our operating partnership s exchangeable senior notes due that the holders may require our operating partnership to repurchase in february our remaining liquidity  including available cash as of february  of approximately million and full availability under our operating partnership s billion line of credit  is expected to provide sufficient capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and provide capital for future investments 
we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital 
we believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service through we are working towards the commencement of two new developments and two redevelopments in the washington  dc market in we have also had discussions with potential tenants for our west th street development project in new york city 
although these discussions are in the preliminary stages and we have not yet made a decision to commence construction  we are encouraged that the market in midtown manhattan has recovered to the point that these discussions are taking place 
for descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during  see item business transactions during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  leasing and assumed 
table of contents financing origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities  and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such criteria are present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
asc requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
effective january   we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal  due diligence and other closing related costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  
table of contents property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
after the determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins  and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in asc capitalization of interest and asc real estate general formerly known as sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed  occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction  or if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest  our representation in the entity s governance  the size of our investment including loans  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
we may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other than temporary 
the ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different 
table of contents than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases 
for the year ended december   the impact of the straight line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately million 
these amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above and below market leases and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures  which are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  revenue  cash flows  leverage and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral  in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 

table of contents tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of through a rating of represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded 
a rating of represents the lowest credit rating  in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies and company financial statements are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space utilization ie  expansion downsize sublease activity  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received  then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc principal agent considerations asc formerly known as emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue 
asc requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis 
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we receive management and development fees from third parties 
property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc real estate sales asc formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the criteria for the full accrual method are not met  we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  leasing  profit sharing  deposit  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an 
table of contents assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes its judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses  net income and equity 
we account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in properties acquired  sold  repositioned and placed in service 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties  inc  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests  losses from early extinguishments of debt  losses gains from investments in securities  net derivative losses  loss gain from suspension of development  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  acquisition costs and general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate  income loss 
table of contents from unconsolidated joint ventures  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties  inc noi excludes certain components from net income attributable to boston properties  inc in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties  inc as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties  inc as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
for a reconciliation of noi to net income attributable to boston properties inc  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio 
the same property portfolio consists of properties  including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned through december   totaling approximately million net rentable square feet of space excluding square feet of structured parking 
the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service  acquired or repositioned after january  or disposed of on or prior to december  there were no properties that were sold or repositioned after january  this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the year ended december  and with respect to the properties which were acquired and placed in service

table of contents same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to included in same property portfolio rental revenue are decreases in contractual rental revenue of approximately million  recoveries from tenants of approximately million and parking and other income of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximately million increase in straight line rent 
the decrease in contractual rental revenue and increase in straight line rents are primarily due to new leases at park avenue and lexington avenue in new york city and a major law firm lease approximately  square feet in boston being in free rent periods 
the free rent periods for the new leases in new york city ranged from six to twelve months  while the law firm s lease in boston had twelve months of free rent  and these periods expired during or will expire during generally  under each of our leases  we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease 
the decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in new york city and a large lease expiration in boston 
although the majority of the space was re leased  the new leases are in their first year during which  generally  no tenant recoveries are earned 
termination income termination income decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to termination income for the year ended december  related to twenty three tenants across the same property portfolio and totaled approximately million  which included approximately million from a small retail tenant in new york city  approximately million of negotiated termination income from our reston  virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and to provide space early to a new tenant  approximately million from a tenant at lexington avenue in new york city to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and approximately million spread across nineteen tenant terminations 
termination income for the year ended december  related to sixteen tenants across the same property portfolio and totaled approximately million  which included approximately million of termination income related to a termination agreement with a tenant at lexington avenue and approximately million was non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases
