item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide an overview of the impact that macroeconomic conditions had on our operations and in the rv  mh  and residential housing industries in we also continued to expand both the breadth and the depth of our products and services through the integration of new and expanded product lines designed to create additional scale advantages 
see strategic acquisitions  expansion and restructuring below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further details 
in accordance with changes made to our internal reporting structure  the company changed its segment reporting from three reportable segments to two reportable segments effective january  operations previously included in the other component manufactured products segment were consolidated with the operations in the primary manufactured products segment to form one new segment called manufacturing 
the other reportable segment  distribution  remained the same as reported in prior periods 
prior year results were reclassified to reflect the new reporting structure 
financial information about patrick s two segments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
competitive position the rv and mh industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry 
this level of competition carries through to the suppliers to these industries 
across the company s range of products and services  competition exists primarily on price  product features  quality  and service 
we believe that the quality  service  design and price of our products and the short order turnaround time that we provide allow us to compete favorably in the rv and mh markets 
we have several competitors that compete with us on a regional and local basis 
in order for a competitor to compete with us on a national basis  we believe that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel would be required 
the other industrial markets in which we continue to expand are also highly competitive 
in  sales to the rv industry continued to strengthen as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the prior year period 
we believe that the restricted availability of capital  high unemployment  slow job growth  low consumer confidence levels  and continued depressed levels of discretionary spending will all continue to contribute to the further volatility in the markets we serve in before a sustained recovery takes hold 
given this environment  the company has identified several operating strategies to maintain or enhance earnings through productivity and fixed cost reduction initiatives  expansion into new product lines  and optimization of capacity utilization 
strategy overview we believe that we have developed quality working relationships with our customers and suppliers  and have oriented our business to the needs of these customers 
these customers include all of the larger rv and mh manufacturers and a number of large to medium sized industrial customers 
our industrial customers generally are directly linked to the residential housing markets 
our rv and mh customers generally demand the lowest competitive prices  high quality standards  short lead times  and a high degree of flexibility from their suppliers 
our industrial customers generally are less price sensitive than our rv and mh customers  and more focused on quality customer service and quick response time 
consequently  we have focused our efforts on driving our customer first performance oriented culture by maintaining and improving the quality of our manufactured products  developing a nationwide manufacturing and distribution presence in response to our customers needs for flexibility and short lead times  and prioritizing the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement in all of our 
table of contents facilities including our corporate office 
additionally  because of the short lead times  which range from hours to same day order receipt and delivery  we have intensified our focus on reducing our inventory levels with the help of some of our key suppliers with vendor managed inventory programs 
these initiatives have been instrumental in improving our operating cash flow and liquidity 
as we explore new markets and industries  we believe that these and other strategic initiatives provide us with a strong foundation for future growth 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
in  approximately of our sales were to the rv industry  to the mh industry  and to the industrial and other markets 
in  we expect an even higher percentage of our total sales to be concentrated in the rv industry than in primarily due to forecasted growth in the rv industry 
operating strategies key operating strategies identified by management  include the following strategic acquisitions  expansion and restructuring we supply a broad variety of building material products and  with our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we believe that we are well positioned for the introduction of new products 
we  from time to time  consider the acquisition of additional product lines  facilities  companies with a strategic fit  or other assets to complement or expand our existing businesses 
in may  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of adorn holdings  inc adorn  an elkhart  indiana based major manufacturer and supplier to the rv  mh and industrial markets  for million 
this acquisition represented the largest acquisition in our history  virtually doubled our manufacturing revenues  and immediately strengthened our market position and presence in the major industries that we serve 
the consolidation of adorn into patrick afforded us many opportunities to realize synergies through facility rationalization  headcount reduction  vendor consolidation  and the implementation of best practices 
in the third quarter of  we completed our restructuring plan the restructuring plan to integrate adorn with our existing businesses which resulted in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately million 
expenses associated with the restructuring plan included the closure of duplicate facilities  severance related to the elimination of redundant jobs  and various asset write downs related to the consolidation of product lines 
we have realized  and expect to continue to realize  synergy savings from this acquisition on a go forward basis 
while operating under depressed market and economic conditions throughout and into  we focused our attention on fixed cost and debt reduction initiatives in order to reduce our leverage ratio  maintain operating cash flow  meet the covenants under our existing credit agreement as defined herein and maximize efficiencies from the consolidation of adorn into patrick 
in january  we acquired the cabinet door business of quality hardwoods sales quality hardwoods 
in august  we added new products and expanded our rv and mh distribution presence through the acquisition of the wiring  electrical and plumbing products distribution business of blazon international group blazon 
strategic divestitures in an effort to strategically align our current operations with businesses within our core competencies  reduce overall fixed costs  and reduce our leverage position  we have explored and will continue to explore various alternatives for the divestiture of certain unprofitable  non core operations 
in  we sold certain assets of our american hardwoods operation and the related operating facility for million 
in addition  we sold certain assets of our aluminum extrusion operation in july for net cash proceeds of million and the assumption by the buyer of approximately million of certain accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decision to divest these two operations was largely based on projected and potential operating losses under the current operating model and working capital requirements of these operations that led us to assess the overall fit of these operations within the parameters of our strategic plan 
the financial results of these operations for all prior periods presented were classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents diversification into other markets while we continually seek to improve our position as a leading supplier to the rv and mh industries  we are also seeking to expand our product lines into other industrial  commercial and institutional markets 
many of our products  such as countertops  cabinet doors  laminated panels  slotwall  and shelving  have applications in the kitchen cabinet  household furniture  and architectural markets 
we have a dedicated sales force focused on increasing our industrial market penetration and on our diversification into additional commercial and institutional markets 
we believe that diversification into other industrial markets provides opportunities for improved operating margins with products that are complementary in nature to our current manufacturing processes 
in addition  we believe that our nationwide manufacturing and distribution capabilities enable us to position ourselves for new product expansion 
utilization of manufacturing capacity efficiency optimization the acquisition and consolidation of adorn into patrick allowed us to increase capacity utilization at all of our consolidated manufacturing facilities 
while we increased capacity utilization as a result of our facility consolidations  the decline in volume levels due to soft industry conditions in all of the major end markets we serve resulted in unused capacity at almost all of our locations 
we have the ability to substantially increase volumes in almost all of our existing facilities without adding comparable incremental fixed costs 
with the expected continued weak economic conditions in certain parts of the country  we are continually exploring opportunities for further facility consolidation 
additionally  we are focused on cross training all of our manufacturing work force in our manufacturing cells within each facility to maximize our efficiencies and increase the flexibility of our labor force 
plant consolidations closures certain manufacturing and distribution operating facilities were either sold or consolidated during and in an effort to improve operating efficiencies in the plants through increased capacity utilization  keep the overhead structure at a level consistent with operating needs  and continue the company s efforts to reduce its leverage position 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its custom vinyls manufacturing facility in ocala  florida 
this facility was sold in late december for million resulting in a pretax gain on sale of million 
the ocala operations were consolidated into the company s alabama and georgia facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its manufacturing and distribution facility in woodburn  oregon 
the oregon facility was sold in february for million and the company recorded a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a listing agreement to sell its remaining manufacturing and distribution facility in fontana  california 
in march  this facility was sold for million and the company recorded a pretax gain on sale of approximately million in its first quarter operating results 
the company is currently operating in the same facility under a lease agreement with the purchaser for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 
in april  we closed our manufacturing division in madisonville  tennessee and consolidated operations into the existing owned mt 
joy  pennsylvania manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the adoption of a new vertical integration strategy by one of our key manufactured housing customers in tennessee who began to produce and supply its own interior home components 
in october  we sold the rv and mh business related to our oregon manufacturing division to a third party in order to realign company assets 
we continue to manufacture and supply high pressure laminate product lines to our industrial customers in this market and operate our existing distribution branch in oregon  which continues to service the rv and mh industries 

table of contents product development and new product introductions discontinuations with our versatile manufacturing and distribution capabilities  we are continually striving to increase our market presence in all of the markets that we serve and gain entrance into other potential markets 
we remain committed to new product introduction and to new product development initiatives 
new product development is critical to growing our revenue base  keeping up with changing market conditions  and proactively addressing customer demand 
we plan to continue to devote our time and attention to manufacturing and distribution products that fit within the strategic parameters of our current business model including appropriate margin and inventory turn levels 
to further enhance our product offerings to our rv  mh and industrial markets customers  we introduced several new products and expanded our existing product lines in our distribution line was expanded to include new wiring  electrical and plumbing products via the acquisition of blazon  adhesives  interior exterior paints  a new laminate flooring product line  a new tile line  and house wrap 
on the manufacturing side  we expanded our existing pressed counter tops product line and began to manufacture a newly designed hardwood slide out fascia 
in early  we discontinued certain distribution product lines including our line of resilient flooring products  a ceramic tile line  and the hardwood products associated with the american hardwoods operation 
principal products through our manufacturing divisions  we manufacture a variety of products including decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped profile mouldings  stiles and battens  hardwood  foil and membrane pressed cabinet doors  drawer sides and bottoms  interior passage doors  slotwall and slotwall components  and countertops 
in conjunction with our manufacturing capabilities  we also provide value added processes  including custom fabrication  edge banding  drilling  boring  and cut to size capabilities 
we distribute pre finished wall and ceiling panels  drywall and drywall finishing products  electronics  adhesives  wiring  electrical and plumbing products  cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  laminate flooring  and other miscellaneous products 
manufactured laminated panels and hardwood doors contributed and  respectively  of total manufacturing segment sales 
the electronics division within our distribution segment contributed of total sales in this segment in we have no material patents  licenses  franchises  or concessions and do not conduct significant research and development activities 
manufacturing processes and operations our primary manufacturing facilities utilize various materials including mdf  gypsum and particleboard  which are bonded by adhesives or a heating process to a number of products  including vinyl  paper  foil and high pressure laminate 
additionally  we offer high pressure laminate laminated to substrates such as particleboard and lauan which has many uses  including counter tops and ambulance cabinetry 
we manufacture laminate countertops and solid surface countertops  as well as slotwall and slotwall components for the retail store fixture markets 
laminated products are used in the production of wall  cabinet  shelving  counter and fixture products with a wide variety of finishes and textures 
we manufacture three distinct cabinet door product lines in both raised and flat panel designs  as well as square  shaker style  cathedral and arched panels 
one product line is manufactured from raw lumber using solid oak  maple  cherry and other hardwood materials 
another line of doors is made of laminated fiberboard  and a third line uses membrane press technology to produce doors and components with vinyls ranging from mil to mil in thickness 
several outside profiles are available on square  shaker style  cathedral  and arched raised panel doors and the components include rosettes  hardwood moulding  arched window trim  blocks and windowsills  among others 
our doors are sold mainly to the rv and mh industries 
we also market to the cabinet manufacturers and ready to assemble furniture manufacturers 

table of contents our vinyl printing facility produces a wide variety of decorative vinyls which are mil in thickness and are shipped in rolls ranging from yards in length 
this facility produces material for both internal use by patrick and sale to external customers 
markets we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the rv and mh industries  and in other industrial markets 
the recent economic recession and the continuing downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations  particularly in the first half of and in most of in the three primary industries in which we operate 
recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases  and therefore  any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income has a negative impact on these markets 
on the rv side  the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of and the first half of severely impacted shipment levels  however  production levels were stronger than expected based on a higher demand for rv s by retail dealers in the latter half of in  the rv industry continued to strengthen as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the mh industry continues to be negatively impacted by financing concerns and a lack of available financing sources  and the current credit situation in the residential housing market puts additional pressure on consumers  who are generally using financial institutions and conventional financing as a source for these purchases 
we expect the overall declines experienced in the mh and industrial markets in and to continue into the first half of approximately of our industrial revenue base in was associated with the us residential housing market  and therefore  there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing production 
recreational vehicles the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand reflecting prevailing general economic conditions which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates  consumer confidence  and concerns about the availability and price of gasoline have an impact on rv sales 
demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term as the number of baby boomers reaching retirement is steadily increasing  products such as sports utility rv s are becoming attractive to younger buyers  and rv manufacturers are also providing an array of product choices  including producing lightweight towables and smaller  fuel efficient motorhomes 
green technologies including lightweight composite materials  solar panels  and energy efficient components are appearing on an increasing number of rvs 
in addition  federal economic credit and stimulus packages that contain provisions to stimulate rv lending and provide favorable tax treatment for new rv purchases may help promote sales and aid in the rv industry s continued economic recovery 
recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the recreational vehicle industry association rvia 
the principal types of recreational vehicles include conventional travel trailers  folding camping trailers  fifth wheel trailers  motor homes  and conversion vehicles 
these recreational vehicles are distinct from mobile homes  which are manufactured houses designed for permanent and semi permanent residential dwelling 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are non motorized vehicles designed to be towed by passenger automobiles  pick up trucks  or vans 
they provide comfortable  self contained living facilities for short periods of time 
conventional travel trailers and folding camping trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle 
fifth wheel trailers  designed to be towed by pick up trucks  are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to the bed area of the pick up truck 
this allows for a bi level floor plan and more living space than a conventional travel trailer 

table of contents a motor home is a self powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis 
the interior typically includes a driver s area  kitchen  bathroom  dining  and sleeping areas 
motor homes are self contained with their own lighting  heating  cooking  refrigeration  sewage holding  and water storage facilities 
although they are not designed for permanent or semi permanent living  motor homes do provide comfortable living facilities for short periods of time 
sales of recreational vehicle products have been cyclical 
shortages of motor vehicle fuels and significant increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the market for recreational vehicles in the past  and could adversely affect demand in the future 
the rv industry is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to dealers and retail purchasers 
substantial increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had a negative impact upon the industry in the past and may do so in the future 
recession and lack of consumer confidence generally result in a decrease in the sale of leisure time products such as recreational vehicles 
since  industry wide wholesale unit shipments of rv s have declined 
the period beginning in and continuing through resulted in seven out of the eight years with shipment levels over  units primarily due to the favorable demographic trend of the aging baby boomer population  improved consumer confidence  depleted dealer inventories  lower interest rates  and a fear of flying after the september  terrorist attacks 
shipment levels started to soften in the third and fourth quarters of and into in  shipment levels declined approximately to  units reflecting the tightest credit conditions in several decades  declining consumer confidence  reduced disposable income levels  and the generally depressed economic environment 
in  shipment levels declined approximately versus  reflecting low consumer confidence and the continuance of unfavorable market conditions experienced by the industry in however  production levels in the rv industry were stronger than expected in the latter half of based on a higher demand for rv s by retail dealers 
in  the rv industry continued to strengthen as shipment levels increased from reaching  units  the highest annual total for rv shipments in the past three years 
in anticipation of continued strengthening short term demand  the rvia is currently forecasting a increase in full year wholesale unit shipments compared to the full year level citing an improvement in dealer demand and retail sales 
according to the rvia  the recovery is expected to strengthen as credit availability  job security and consumer confidence improve 
the company estimates that approximately of its revenues related to the rv industry are derived from the towables sector of the market 
in  the towables sector of the rv market represented approximately of total units shipped into the market as a whole 
the towable units are lighter and less expensive than standard gas or diesel powered units representing a more attractive solution for the cost conscious buyer 
from to  motorized unit shipments rose approximately and towable unit shipments rose approximately 
we believe that we are well positioned with respect to our product mix within the rv industry to take advantage of any improved market conditions 

table of contents the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the rv industry from through per rvia statistics manufactured housing manufactured homes traditionally have been one of the principal means for first time homebuyers to overcome the obstacles of large down payments and higher monthly mortgage payments due to the relative lower cost of construction as compared to site built homes 
manufactured housing also presents an affordable alternative to site built homes for retirees and others desiring a lifestyle in which home ownership is less burdensome than in the case of site built homes 
the increase in square footage of living space and updated modern designs in manufactured homes created by multi sectional models has made them more attractive to a larger segment of homebuyers 
manufactured homes are built in accordance with national  state and local building codes 
manufactured homes are factory built and transported to a site where they are installed  often permanently 
some manufactured homes have design limitations imposed by the constraints of efficient production and over the road transit 
delivery expense limits the effective competitive shipping range of the manufactured homes to approximately to miles 
modular homes  which are a component of the manufactured housing industry  are factory built homes that are built in sections and transported to the site for installation 
these homes are generally set on a foundation and are subject to land home financing terms and conditions 
in recent years  these units have been gaining in popularity due to their aesthetic similarity to site built homes and their relatively less expensive cost 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and is affected by the availability of alternative housing  such as apartments  town houses  condominiums and site built housing 
in addition  interest rates  availability of financing  regional population  employment trends  and general regional economic conditions affect the sale of manufactured homes 
since  industry wide wholesale unit shipments of manufactured homes have declined 
the level of  wholesale units was at the lowest level in the last years 
mh unit shipments in rose a modest when compared to factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include quality credit standards in the residential housing market  improved job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  and higher interest rates on traditional residential housing 
the company currently estimates mh unit shipments for full year to increase in the range of approximately to compared to the full year level 
we believe that the factors responsible for the past decade plus decline include lack of available financing and access to the asset backed securities markets  high vacancy rates in apartments  high levels of repossessed housing inventories  over built housing markets in certain regions of the country that resulted in fewer sales of new manufactured homes  as well as the generally depressed economic environment 
additionally  low conventional mortgage rates and less restrictive lending terms for residential site built housing over much of this period contributed 
table of contents to the decline as manufactured home loans generally carry a higher interest rate and less competitive terms 
beginning in mid and continuing through  the mh industry has also had to contend with credit requirements that became more stringent and a reduction in availability of lenders for manufactured homes for both retailers and dealers 
while there is demand for permanent rebuilding in areas damaged by major hurricanes in recent years  credit conditions remain adverse especially as a result of the recent credit crisis  and current overall economic conditions are not favorable in relation to the factors which will promote positive growth 
the availability of financing and access to the asset backed securities market is still restricted  and we believe that employment growth and standard quality oriented lending practices in the conventional site built housing markets are needed to enable more balanced demand  thus resulting in the potential for increased production and shipment levels in the mh industry 
the following chart reflects the historical wholesale unit shipment levels in the mh industry from through per the manufactured housing institute other markets many of our core manufacturing products  including paper vinyl laminated panels  shelving  drawer sides  and high pressure laminated panels are utilized in the kitchen cabinet  store fixture and commercial furnishings  and residential furniture markets 
these markets are generally categorized by a more performance than price driven customer base  and provide an opportunity for us to diversify our clientele  while providing increased contribution to our core laminating and fabricating competencies 
while the residential furniture markets have been severely impacted by import pressures  other segments have been less vulnerable  and therefore provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains 
while demand for our products in the residential market has been adversely impacted by the severe housing downturn  long term growth in the residential market will be based on improved job growth  low interest rates  and continuing government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures  which we believe will ultimately increase the demand for our products 
demand in the industrial markets in which the company competes also fluctuates with economic cycles 
industrial demand tends to lag the housing cycle by six to twelve months and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects 
as a result  we believe continued focus on the industrial markets will help moderate the impact of the cyclical patterns in the rv mh markets on our operating results 
we have the available capacity to increase industrial revenue and benefit from the diversity of multiple market segments  unique regional economies and varied customer strategies 
marketing and distribution our sales are to recreational vehicle and manufactured housing manufacturers and other industrial products manufacturers 
we have approximately active customers 
we have five customers  who together accounted for approximately and of our consolidated net sales in and  respectively 
we believe we have good relationships with our customers 

table of contents sales to two different rv customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net sales of the company for the year ended december  for  sales to two different customers in the rv market accounted for approximately and  respectively  and another customer in the mh market accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
in  sales to two different rv customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net sales 
most products for distribution are generally purchased in carload or truckload quantities  warehoused  and then sold and delivered by us 
in addition  approximately and of our distribution segment s products were shipped directly from the suppliers to our customers in and  respectively 
we typically experience a one to two week delay between issuing our purchase orders and the delivery of products to our warehouses or customers 
as lead times have declined over the years  in some instances  certain customers have required same day or next day service 
we generally keep backup supplies of various commodity products in our warehouses to ensure that we have product on hand at all times for our distribution customers 
our customers do not maintain long term supply contracts  and therefore we must bear the risk of accurate advanced estimation of customer orders 
we have no significant backlog of orders 
we operate warehouse and distribution centers and manufacturing operations located in alabama  arizona  california  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  minnesota  oregon  pennsylvania  tennessee and texas 
by using these facilities  we are able to minimize our in transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing plants of our customers 
patrick does not engage in significant marketing efforts nor does it incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures other than attendance at certain trade shows and the activities of its sales personnel and the maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service and customer satisfaction 
in our design showroom located in elkhart  indiana  many of our manufactured and distribution products are on display for current and potential customers 
we believe that the design showroom has provided patrick with the opportunity to grow its market share by educating our customers regarding the style and content options that we have available and by offering custom design services to further differentiate our product lines 
suppliers during the year ended december   we purchased approximately of our raw materials and distributed products from twenty different suppliers 
the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our purchases 
our current major material suppliers with contracts through december  include united states gypsum  mjb wood group and tumac lumber company 
we have terms and conditions with these and other suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain areas  pricing structures  rebate agreements and other parameters 
materials are primarily commodity products  such as lauan  gypsum  particleboard  and other lumber products  which are available from many suppliers 
we maintain a long term supply agreement with one of our major suppliers of materials to the mh industry 
our sales in the short term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major supplier 
we believe that we have a good relationship with this supplier and all of our other suppliers 
alternate sources of supply are available for all of our major material purchases 
regulation and environmental quality the company s operations are subject to certain federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during their manufacturing processes 
over the past several years  patrick has taken a proactive role in certifying that the composite wood substrate materials that it uses to produce products for its customers in the rv marketplace have complied with applicable emission standards developed by the california air resources board carb 
all suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current carb regulations 
we believe that we are currently operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and have made reports and submitted information as required 
the company believes that the expense of compliance with these laws and 
table of contents regulations with respect to environmental quality  as currently in effect  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or competitive position  and will not require any material capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications which would adversely affect earnings 
seasonality manufacturing operations in the rv and mh industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate 
accordingly  the company s sales and profits are generally highest in the second and third quarters 
however  seasonal industry trends have been different than in prior years primarily due to depressed economic conditions for both industries during most of and increased demand from rv dealers since the fourth quarter of employees as of december   we had employees  of which were engaged directly in production  warehousing  and delivery operations  in sales  and in office and administrative activities 
there were no manufacturing plants or distribution centers covered by collective bargaining agreements 
patrick continuously reviews benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers its relations with its employees to be good

item a 
risk factors the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks related to its business 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
all of these risks should be carefully considered 
our results of operations have been  and may continue to be  adversely impacted by the effects of the recent worldwide macroeconomic downturn 
in and part of  general worldwide economic conditions continued to experience a downturn due to the effects of the deterioration in the residential housing market  subprime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  increased commodity costs  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns the economic crisis 
these conditions adversely affected demand in the three major end markets we serve the recreational vehicle rv  manufactured housing mh and industrial markets in resulting in decreased sales of our component products into these markets 
although economic conditions improved in and  as a result our sales  operating income  and cash flows improved when compared to  a further deterioration in these conditions could negatively affect our operations and result in lower sales  income  and cash flows in the future 
in addition  it is still difficult at times for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if our business conditions warrant  we may be forced to close and or consolidate certain of our operating facilities  sell assets  and or reduce our workforce  which may result in our incurring restructuring charges 
we cannot predict the duration of the economic downturn  the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery or the 
table of contents extent to which the economic downturn will continue to negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the continuing downturn in the residential housing market has had an adverse impact on our operations  and is expected to continue into the residential housing market has experienced overall declines and credit concerns that are expected to continue into approximately of our industrial revenue in is directly or indirectly influenced by conditions in the residential housing market 
the decline in demand for residential housing and the tightening of consumer credit have lowered demand for our industrial products and have had an adverse impact on our operations as a whole 
in addition  the impact of the sub prime mortgage crisis and housing downturn on consumer confidence  discretionary spending  and general economic conditions has decreased and may continue to decrease demand for our products sold to the mh and rv industries 
we may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the closure of all or part of a manufacturing or distribution facility 
we periodically assess the cost structure of our operating facilities to distribute and or manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner 
our manufacturing and distribution facilities in woodburn  oregon and fontana  california were sold in february and march  respectively  and we are currently operating in the same facilities under a lease agreement with the purchasers for the use of a portion of the square footage previously occupied 
we incurred charges in the first quarter of related to downsizing our operations in the california facility and to accommodate the use of this facility by two different parties 
in addition  in april  we closed our manufacturing division in madisonville  tennessee and consolidated operations into the existing owned mt 
joy  pennsylvania manufacturing facility in order to offset a sizable reduction in sales volumes that stemmed from the adoption of a new vertical integration strategy by one of our key manufactured housing customers in tennessee who began to produce and supply its own interior home components 
in october  we sold the rv and mh business related to our oregon manufacturing division to a third party in order to realign company assets 
based on our assessments and if required by business conditions  we may make capital investments to move  discontinue manufacturing and or distribution capabilities  sell or close all or part of additional manufacturing and or distribution facilities in the future 
these changes could result in significant future charges or disruptions in our operations  and we may not achieve the expected benefits from these changes which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the financial condition of our customers and suppliers may deteriorate as a result of the current economic environment and competitive conditions in their markets 
the lingering effects of the recent economic crisis may lead to increased levels of restructurings  bankruptcies  liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers  suppliers and other service providers and financial institutions with whom we do business 
such events could  in turn  negatively affect our business either through loss of sales or inability to meet our commitments or inability to meet them without excess expense because of loss of suppliers or other providers 
in addition  several of our major customers are undergoing unprecedented financial distress which may result in such customers undergoing major restructuring  reorganization or other significant changes 
the occurrence of any such event could have further adverse consequences to our business including a decrease in demand for our products 
if such customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy  our ability to recover accounts receivables from those customers would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy trustee 
many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets  and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result 
a decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by customers 
in addition  such a decline could result in lower demand for our products and services 

table of contents although we have a number of large customers  a limited number of customers account for a significant percentage of the company s sales and the loss of several significant customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we have a number of customers that account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
specifically  two customers in the rv market accounted for a combined of consolidated net sales in the loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with customers and cannot predict that we will maintain our current relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply them at current levels 
the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment and our sales could be negatively impacted by our inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  or the decision of our customers to purchase our competitors products instead of our products 
we compete not only with other suppliers to the rv and mh producers but also with suppliers to traditional site built homebuilders and suppliers of cabinetry and flooring 
sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  advertising  operational  promotional  or other decisions made by purchasers of our products 
additionally  we cannot control the decisions made by suppliers of our distributed and manufactured products and therefore  our ability to maintain our exclusive and non exclusive distributor contracts and agreements may be adversely impacted 
the greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions 
certain competitors may also have the ability to develop innovative new products that could put the company at a competitive disadvantage 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers and suppliers to the rv and mh industries  we could lose customers and sales could decline  or we will not be able to improve or maintain profit margins on sales to customers or be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets 
seasonality and cyclical economic conditions affect the rv and mh markets the company serves 
the rv and mh markets are cyclical and dependent upon various factors  including the general level of economic activity  consumer confidence  interest rates  access to financing  inventory and production levels  and the cost of fuel 
economic and demographic factors can cause substantial fluctuations in production  which in turn impact sales and operating results 
demand for recreational vehicles and manufactured housing generally declines during the winter season 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
consequently  the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
the cyclical nature of the domestic housing market has caused our sales and operating results to fluctuate 
these fluctuations may continue in the future  which could result in operating losses during downturns 
the us housing industry is highly cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors  including terms and availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers  consumer confidence  interest rates  population and employment trends  income levels  housing demand  and general economic conditions  including inflation  deflation and recessions 
the rv and mh industries and the industrial markets are affected by the fluctuations in the residential housing market 
as a result of the foregoing factors  our sales and operating results fluctuate  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
moreover  cyclical and seasonal downturns in the residential housing market may cause us to experience operating losses 

table of contents fuel shortages or higher prices for fuel have had  and could continue to have  an adverse impact on our operations 
the products produced by the rv industry typically require gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation  or the use of a vehicle requiring gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation 
there can be no assurance that the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on fuel will not significantly increase in the future 
shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a significant adverse effect on the demand for recreational vehicles in the past and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on demand in the future 
rapid significant increases in fuel prices  as we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing  appear to affect the demand for recreational vehicles when gasoline prices reach unusually high levels 
such a reduction in overall demand for recreational vehicles could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 
approximately and of our sales were to the rv industry for and for  respectively 
in  we expect an even higher percentage of our total sales to be concentrated in the rv industry than in primarily due to forecasted growth in the rv industry 
we are dependent on third party suppliers and manufacturers 
generally  our raw materials  supplies and energy requirements are obtained from various sources and in the quantities desired 
while alternative sources are available  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in the delivery 
fluctuations in the prices of these requirements may be driven by the supply demand relationship for that commodity or governmental regulation 
in addition  if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated  the availability or price of these requirements could be adversely affected 
the increased cost and limited availability of raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
prices of certain materials  including gypsum  lauan  particleboard  mdf  and other commodity products  can be volatile and change dramatically with changes in supply and demand 
certain products are purchased from overseas and are dependent upon vessel shipping schedules and port availability 
further  certain of our commodity product suppliers sometimes operate at or near capacity  resulting in some products having the potential of being put on allocation 
we generally have been able to maintain adequate supplies of materials and to pass higher material costs on to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases where needed 
however  it is not certain that future price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities 
the recent credit crisis and its continuing impact on the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials 
our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items 
we are subject to governmental and environmental regulations  and failure in our compliance efforts could result in damages  expenses or liabilities that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing businesses are subject to various governmental and environmental regulations 
implementation of new regulations or amendments to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of the company s products 
certain components of manufactured and modular homes are subject to regulation by the us consumer product safety commission 
we currently use materials that we believe comply with government regulations 
we cannot presently determine what  if any  legislation may be adopted by congress or state or local governing bodies  or the effect any such legislation may have on us or the mh industry 
in addition  failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or potential civil or criminal liability 
both scenarios could negatively our results of operations or financial condition 
the inability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and key personnel may adversely affect our operations 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our business and strategic plan in the short term and could cause our sales and operating results to decline 

table of contents our ability to integrate acquired businesses may adversely affect operations 
as part of our business and strategic plan  we look for strategic acquisitions to provide shareholder value 
any acquisition will require the effective integration of an existing business and its administrative  financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing and other functions to maximize synergies 
acquired businesses involve a number of risks that may affect our financial performance  including increased leverage  diversion of management resources  assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses  and possible corporate culture conflicts 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these acquisitions  we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process  and our financial results may be negatively impacted 
additionally  significant unexpected liabilities could arise from these acquisitions 
increased levels of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had approximately million of total debt under our senior secured credit facility the credit facility 
our indebtedness  which was primarily the result of the adorn acquisition in  as well as a greater need for working capital  may harm our financial condition and negatively impact our results of operations 
the level of indebtedness could have consequences on our future operations  including i making it more difficult for us to meet our payments on outstanding debt  ii an event of default  if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement dated may  the credit agreement governing the credit facility  which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  iii reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  iv limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  v placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged  and vi creating concerns about our credit quality which could result in the loss of supplier contracts and or customers 
although the company s current lenders extended our existing credit facility to may  as modified by the fifth amendment to the credit agreement in december the fifth amendment in order to allow us to execute a new long term credit facility  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
we are currently negotiating a new long term credit facility  as well as a subordinated debt financing required in connection with such facility 
the level of indebtedness under any new credit facility could have consequences to our future operations comparable to those described above 
our current credit agreement contains various financial performance and other covenants with which we must remain in compliance 
if we do not remain in compliance with these covenants  our credit agreement could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder could become immediately due and payable 
any new credit facility will likewise contain various performance and other covenants and any breaches of those covenants could cause acceleration of debt beyond the company s ability to fund such debt 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding that contains financial and non financial covenants with which we must comply that place restrictions on us 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance during with the financial covenants as modified by the fifth amendment 
these covenants are measured on a quarterly basis and require that we attain minimum levels of consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance during with the financial covenants contained in any new credit agreement that we may enter into to replace or refinance the existing credit facility 
if we fail to comply with our covenants under the fifth amendment and or under any new credit agreement  the lenders could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in our having to refinance the related indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full 
if current unfavorable credit market conditions were to persist throughout  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
for additional details and discussion concerning these financial covenants see liquidity and capital resources in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents industry conditions and our operating results have limited our sources of capital in the past 
if we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
we depend on our cash balances  our cash flows from operations  our existing credit facility  and any new credit facility going forward  and borrowing against our corporate owned life insurance policies to finance our operating requirements  capital expenditures and other needs 
if the general economic conditions that prevailed during and continue or worsen  production of rvs and manufactured homes will likely decline  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
a further decline in our operating results could negatively impact our liquidity 
in addition  the downturn in the rv and mh industries  combined with our operating results and other changes  limited our sources of financing in the past 
if our cash balances  cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit agreement or any new credit agreement  are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available  we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions  or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations 
we have letters of credit representing collateral for our casualty insurance programs and for general operating purposes 
the letters of credit are issued under our credit agreement 
for additional detail and information concerning the amounts of our letters of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the inability to retain our current letters of credit  to obtain alternative letter of credit sources  or to retain our current credit agreement to support these programs could require us to post cash collateral  reduce the amount of cash available for our operations or cause us to curtail or limit existing operations 
increased levels of inventory may adversely affect our profitability 
our customers generally do not maintain long term supply contracts and  therefore  we must bear the risk of advanced estimation of customer orders 
we maintain an inventory to support these customers needs 
changes in demand  market conditions and or product specifications could result in material obsolescence and a lack of alternative markets for certain of our customer specific products and could negatively impact operating results 
we may be subject to additional charges for impairment of assets  including goodwill and other long lived assets  due to potential declines in the fair value of those assets or a decline in expected profitability of the company or individual reporting units of the company 
a portion of our total assets as of december  was comprised of goodwill  amortizable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  each of these assets is subject to periodic review and testing to determine whether the asset is recoverable or realizable 
the events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include a reduction in our stock price and market capitalization and changes in our estimated future cash flows  as well as changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units 
in the future  if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
significant impairment charges  although not always affecting current cash flow  could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
a variety of factors could influence fluctuations in the market price for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future in response to a number of factors  including those discussed below 
the market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate 
some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include variations in our and our competitors operating results  historically low trading volume  high concentration of shares held by institutional investors and in particular our majority shareholder  tontine capital partners  lp and affiliates collectively  tontine capital  
table of contents announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the gain or loss of significant customers  additions or departure of key personnel  events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us  general conditions in industries in which we operate  general conditions in the united states and abroad  the presence or absence of short selling of our common stock  future sales of our common stock or debt securities  announcements by us or our competitors of technological improvements or new products  and the sale by tontine capital or its announcement of an intention to sell  all or a portion of its equity interests in the company 
fluctuations in the stock market may have an adverse effect upon the price of our common stock 
the stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations 
these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
holders of our common stock are subject to the risk of dilution of their investment as the result of the issuance to our lenders of warrants to purchase common stock 
as part of the consideration for amending our credit agreement on december   we entered into a warrant agreement under which we issued to our lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of the warrants 
the warrants are immediately exercisable  subject to anti dilution provisions and expire on december  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was increased to an aggregate of  shares and the exercise price was adjusted to per share during the exercise of the warrants would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
the renegotiation and extension of our current credit facility that expires on may   or any replacement credit facility  could involve the issuance of additional warrants or other equity based arrangements  which would result in additional dilution to the holders of our common stock and could require a further adjustment to the warrants pursuant to the anti dilution provisions 
the company and an affiliate of tontine capital have executed a commitment letter whereby the tontine capital affiliate would provide all or a portion of the subordinated debt financing required in connection with any new credit facility 
it is expected that warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price of per share and with a term of five years  will be issued for each  of original principal amount of subordinated debt provided currently expected to be approximately  shares in the aggregate 
a majority of our common stock is held by tontine capital  which has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval and whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
in addition  the ownership of a significant portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a few holders 
as of march   tontine capital owned  shares of our common stock or approximately of our total common stock outstanding 
as a result of its majority interest  tontine capital has the ability to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation  the approval of mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  decisions affecting our capital structure and other significant corporate transactions 
in addition to its majority interest  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated april   if tontine capital i holds between and of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint one nominee to our board  or ii holds at least of our common stock then outstanding  tontine capital has the right to appoint two 
table of contents nominees to our board 
tontine capital s rights related to the appointment of directors were affirmed in a subsequent securities purchase agreement with tontine capital  dated march  on july   a nominee of tontine capital was appointed to the board 
as of march   tontine capital has one director on the company s board of directors and has not exercised its right to nominate a second director to the board 
the company and an affiliate of tontine capital have executed a commitment letter whereby the tontine capital affiliate would provide all or a portion of the subordinated debt financing required in connection with any new credit facility 
it is expected that a warrant to purchase common stock will be issued in connection with the subordinated debt  which could increase the ownership of our common stock by tontine capital 
the interests of tontine capital may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
the influence of tontine capital may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management  or limiting the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
in addition  tontine capital and its affiliates are in the business of investing in companies and may  from time to time  invest in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us 
tontine capital and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital or the other institutions will sell or otherwise dispose of substantial amounts of our common stock 
sales or other dispositions of our common stock by these institutions could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  we are aware of one other institution that owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  tontine capital indicated in a filing with the sec in november that it would begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company 
this filing  and any future dispositions of stock by tontine capital  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on november   tontine capital filed with the sec an amendment to its previously filed schedule d with respect to its ownership of common stock of the company 
tontine capital stated that it would begin to explore alternatives for the disposition of its equity interests in the company  which alternatives may include a dispositions of our common stock through open market sales  underwritten offerings and or privately negotiated sales  b a sale of the company  or c distributions by tontine capital of its shares to its investors 
the public disclosure of such possible disposition may adversely affect the market price for our common stock due to the large number of shares involved 
in addition  we are not able to predict whether or when tontine capital will dispose of its stock 
any such future disposition of stock by tontine capital may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in march  tontine capital disclosed that it had reallocated the ownership of certain shares of common stock of the company owned by it to a new investment fund  tontine capital overseas master fund ii  lp tcomf 
the aggregate common stock ownership of tontine capital following the reallocation did not change 
in addition  tontine capital disclosed that tcomf may hold and or dispose of such securities or may purchase additional securities of the company  at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our shareholders each might consider to be in their best interest 
our articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider  and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
we have in place a rights agreement which permits under certain circumstances each holder of common stock  other than potential acquirers  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of a newly created series of our preferred stock at a purchase price of or to acquire additional shares of our common stock at of the current market price 
the 
table of contents rights are not exercisable or transferable until a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  except with respect to tontine capital and its affiliates and associates  which are exempt from the provisions of the rights agreement pursuant to an amendment signed on march  the effects of the rights agreement would be to discourage a stockholder from attempting to take over our company without negotiating with our board of directors 
conditions within the insurance markets could impact our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for various liability coverages and could potentially result in uninsured losses 
we negotiate our insurance contracts annually for property  casualty  workers compensation  general liability  health insurance  and directors and officers liability coverage 
due to conditions within these insurance markets and other factors beyond our control  future coverage limits  terms and conditions and the amount of the related premiums could have a negative impact on our operating results 
while we continually measure the risk reward of policy limits and coverage  the lack of coverage in certain circumstances could result in potential uninsured losses

table of contents executive summary company overview and business segments patrick is a major manufacturer of component products and distributor of building products serving the recreational vehicle rv  manufactured housing mh  kitchen cabinet  household furniture  fixtures and commercial furnishings  marine  and other industrial markets and operates coast to coast through locations in states 
patrick major manufactured products include decorative vinyl and paper panels  wrapped profile mouldings  interior passage doors  cabinet doors and components  slotwall and slotwall components  and countertops 
the company also distributes drywall and drywall finishing products  electronics  adhesives  wiring  electrical and plumbing products  cement siding  interior passage doors  roofing products  laminate flooring  and other related products 
the company has two reportable business segments manufacturing and distribution  which contributed approximately and  respectively  to net sales 
overview of markets and related industry performance while uncertainty surrounding the future course of the global economy helped fuel the decline in our sales to the rv  mh  and industrial markets in prior periods  we have seen improvement in two of the primary markets that we serve 
the rv industry  which represented of the company s sales  continued to strengthen in as evidenced by higher production levels and wholesale unit shipments versus the prior year period 
according to the recreational vehicle industry association rvia  shipment levels of  units in represented an increase of versus the comparable prior year period reflecting five consecutive quarter over quarter increases in shipments following declines in the previous fiscal quarters 
although the year marked the third year in the last nine years that shipment levels fell below the  unit level  it represented the first year in which shipment levels increased in the last four years 
while the full restoration of rv sales to prior levels is projected to be slow  many of our existing customers have increased production and capacity as well as added to their workforce during compared to based on current economic conditions  we anticipate that rv shipments on an annualized basis should continue to improve over at least the next to months 
in the mh sector  full year unit shipments rose compared to with nominal seasonal improvement and continue to be well below historical levels  especially given the current unstable condition in the residential housing market 
the continuation of the unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in most sectors of the economy in  including restricted availability of capital  high unemployment  slow job growth  low consumer confidence levels  and continued depressed levels of discretionary spending  all contributed to the negative impact on the three major markets the company serves 
long term demographic trends favor rv industry growth fueled by the anticipated positive impact that aging baby boomers are estimated to have on the industry as the industry continues its recovery from the recent economic recession 
although consumers still remain cautious when deciding whether or not to purchase discretionary items such as rvs  demographic trends point to positive conditions for this particular market sector in the long term 
as a result of the recent short term demand strength  the rvia is predicting a increase in full year unit shipments compared to the full year level as an improving economy should help keep retail sales of rvs on an upward trend in based on this estimated increase in unit shipments in the rv market compared to the softness in the other primary market sectors in which patrick operates  and the impact of the acquisitions completed in  the company expects its rv market sales concentration to increase moderately in the mh industry  which represented approximately of the company s sales in  continues to be negatively impacted by a lack of financing and the availability of credit  job losses  and excess residential housing foreclosure inventories even though the industry has begun to shows signs of improvement 
according to industry sources  wholesale unit shipments of  in were basically flat compared to the level of  units  levels not seen since growth in the mh industry continues to be negatively impacted by restricted credit conditions  large inventories of traditional site built homes  and a significant number of foreclosed homes that are available 
factors that may favorably impact production levels in this industry include quality credit standards in the residential housing market  improved job growth  favorable changes in financing laws  new tax credits for new home buyers and other government incentives  and higher interest rates on traditional residential housing 
the company currently estimates mh unit shipments for full year to increase in the range of approximately to compared to the full year level 

table of contents the industrial market sector  which is tied to the residential housing market and accounted for approximately of the company s sales  also showed signs of improvement in new housing starts for full year increased approximately from the comparable period in as reported by the us department of commerce 
we estimate that approximately of our industrial revenue base is linked to the residential housing market  and we believe that there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing construction 
our sales to this market generally lag new residential housing starts by six to twelve months 
while the national association of homebuilders nahb has forecasted as of february  a increase in new housing starts and a increase in existing single family home sales in compared to  we remain cautious about further growth in the industrial sector due to restricted credit conditions and current uncertainty related to general economic conditions and the large numbers of repossessed homes in the marketplace 
in the long term  residential expenditure growth will be based on job growth  the availability of credit  affordable interest rates  and continuing government incentives to stimulate housing demand and reduce surplus inventory due to foreclosures 
in addition  higher energy costs continue to affect the costs of raw materials 
the company continues to explore alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestically and from overseas 
in the last several years  there have been concerns about the allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china and sold in the us we do not believe that we have had any exposure to such products because we purchase our drywall materials from domestic suppliers that have certified to us that their products were not manufactured in china 
acquisitions and sales consolidations of facilities in january  the company acquired certain assets of the cabinet door business of quality hardwoods sales quality hardwoods for million 
approximately million of intangible assets were recorded in the manufacturing segment as a result of the acquisition

summary of liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to meet seasonal working capital demands  meet debt service requirements  and support our capital expenditure plans 
we also have a substantial asset collateral base  which we believe if sold in the normal course  is more than sufficient to cover our outstanding senior debt 
we obtain additional liquidity through selling our products and collecting receivables 
we use the funds collected to pay creditors and employees and to fund working capital needs 
the company has another source of cash through the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
we believe that cash generated from operations  borrowings under our current credit facility or any replacement credit facility  and additional liquidity from life insurance policies  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditure programs as currently contemplated 
we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
the interest rate we may earn on the cash we invest in short term investments is subject to market fluctuations 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  a portion of our debt obligations under our credit facility are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on libor 
cash  cash equivalents  and borrowings available under our existing credit facility and the proposed replacement credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance the known and or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs of the company for at least the next months 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes related to the rv and mh industries  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would seek to revise our operating strategies accordingly 
we expect to maintain compliance with the revised minimum quarterly consolidated ebitda covenant  as modified in the fifth amendment  based on the company s operating plan  notwithstanding continued uncertain and volatile market conditions 
management has also identified other actions within its control that could be implemented  if necessary  to help the company reduce its leverage position 
these actions include the exploration of asset sales  divestitures and other types of capital raising alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to retire or sufficiently reduce the company s indebtedness under the credit agreement prior to its expiration 
we currently have the intent and we believe we have the ability to refinance or replace our credit facility  which is scheduled to expire on may  beginning in the second quarter of  we commenced discussions with existing and other lenders regarding the refinancing of our credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to classify our outstanding indebtedness as a long term liability as of december   the 
table of contents following two criteria were required the company must have the intent to refinance  and the company must have the ability to consummate the refinancing 
the ability to consummate the refinancing can be satisfied by either a the issuance of a long term obligation after the date of the company s statement of financial position but before that statement is issued  or b entrance into a financing agreement before the statement of financial position is issued that clearly permits it to refinance the short term obligation on a long term basis on terms that are readily determinable  and certain conditions are being satisfied 
the refinancing was not completed by the time we issued our statement of financial position for the year ended december   nor was a financing agreement relating to the refinancing entered into before such time 
based on the above criteria  our outstanding long term indebtedness as of december  was classified as a current liability until such time as the refinancing or replacement of our credit facility is completed 
the company s financial statements at december  reflect a deficit in working capital total current assets less total current liabilities of approximately million primarily as a result of the classification of its credit facility as short term 
on february   tontine capital and the company entered into the letter of intent concerning the proposed acquisition by tontine capital of up to million of secured senior subordinated notes of the company 
the notes  which would be issued in connection with the refinancing of the company s credit facility  would have a five year maturity  with interest only payments due over the term and the entire principal amount due at maturity 
in addition  for every million of original principal amount of the notes  the note holder would receive warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of per share and a five year term 
the timing of the closing of the purchase of the notes would be dependent upon many factors  including  without limitation  the successful refinancing of the company s credit facility  satisfactory legal documentation and other standard conditions 
on march   the company and tontine capital executed a commitment letter with respect to such financing  on terms and subject to conditions substantially identical to those contained in the letter of intent 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our amended credit agreement  there can be no assurance that a majority of the lenders that are party to our credit agreement will consent to a further amendment of the credit agreement 
in this event  the lenders could cause the related indebtedness to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in the company having to refinance this indebtedness under unfavorable terms 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full should they be required to be sold outside of the normal course of business  such as through forced liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings 
further  while conditions in the credit markets have improved in recent months and we are currently in negotiations with respect to a new long term credit facility to refinance the credit facility  if unfavorable conditions were to return before the credit facility expires  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations 
we have provided additional details about some of these obligations in our notes to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments trade receivables 
we are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of building products and material for use primarily by the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries and other industrial markets 
trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we control credit risk related to our trade receivables through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
in assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables  the company estimates the recoverability by making assumptions based on its historical write off and collection experience and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company does not accrue interest on any of its trade receivables 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased by million to million at december  compared to million for in  the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased by million to million compared to million for in  the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by million to million compared to  in the prior year to reflect certain customers of the company that had closed or filed bankruptcy 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for inventory obsolescence of million and million was established at december  and  respectively 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
the company decreased its reserve for obsolescence by million at december  to million from million at december  and decreased the reserve by million at december  from million at december  reflecting a continued focus on managing inventory to levels more consistent with demand in order to maximize liquidity 
during  depressed market conditions and commodity market price declines contributed to a significant decrease in product demand 
as a result  the company increased its reserve for obsolescence by 
table of contents million to million at december  from million at december  to reflect inventory dedicated to certain customers who had filed bankruptcy 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the rv or mh industries  and or a loss of a major customer or several customers 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and forecasts 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
a change in the company s business climate in  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  led to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which subsequently resulted in an impairment charge of million related to machinery and equipment which is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations 
no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment for the years ended december  and  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for those years 
all of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are based on established fair value techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses require management to estimate both future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting valuation models  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty  and differences in actual future results may require further impairment charges  which may be significant 
impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill and other intangible assets 
although goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  we perform the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if conditions warrant based on estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  and or a significant decrease in the market value of the company s discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge 
in addition  the assumptions  inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the company performs the valuation 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rate  five year compound average growth rate  and the weighted average cost of capital 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the impairment calculation compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill and intangible assets with the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
finite lived intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist  similar to other long lived assets 
a change in the company s business climate in  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  led to a required assessment of the company s goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
based on the results of a third party appraisal and the company s impairment analyses in  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge and a million impairment charge to write down its other intangible assets to fair value 
based on the results of the annual impairment analyses  no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required the company to re evaluate its goodwill or other intangible assets for the years ended december  and  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges for those years 

table of contents deferred income taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if these assumptions change  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its gross deferred tax assets  which would cause the company to record additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the potential the company will be able to realize its gross deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
the company recorded an million valuation allowance in and increased the valuation allowance by million in the valuation allowance was reduced by million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details

purchase of property not applicable 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of lauan  gypsum  and particleboard are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
during periods of rising commodity prices  we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented
