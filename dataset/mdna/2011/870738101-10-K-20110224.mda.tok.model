item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management s discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our new zealand discontinued operations 
the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in  and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from our texas properties as well as onshore and inland waters of louisiana 
we are one of the largest producers of crude oil in the state of louisiana  and hold a large acreage position in texas prospective for liquids rich eagle ford shale and olmos tight sands development 
oil production accounted for of our production and of our oil and gas revenues  and combined production for both oil and natural gas liquids ngls made up of our production and of our oil and gas sales 
this emphasis has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production than natural gas production during highlights increases in earnings and cash flow 
our year to year income from continuing operations increased by million and cash provided by operating activities increased by million  as oil and ngl prices received in were and higher  respectively  than the average prices we received in  while natural gas prices increased in improved liquidity at year end in november  we raised million net through an underwritten public stock offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
this followed an equity offering in the third quarter of when we raised million net in the sale of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
taken together with million of borrowing capacity under our credit agreement at december   our improved liquidity provides capital  if needed  for our expanded drilling program 
increased reserves 
year end total proved reserves increased  or mmboe over reserves quantities at december   with a year end pv value increasing by approximately million to billion 
south texas drilling 
during we drilled horizontal wells and an additional vertical wells helping us evaluate eagle ford and olmos acreage positions in our south texas area 
at year end  our south texas core area surpassed southeast louisiana in terms of both production and proven reserves 
we also entered into long term agreement with a major industry service provider for south texas  securing access to fracing services at competitive prices for a two year period 
shareholder return 
we had annual shareholder return during of development joint ventures 
over the last months we have entered into joint venture agreements with large independent oil and gas producers covering acreage in both our awp and burr ferry fields  allowing us to both monetize a portion of our significant acreage positions including a  acre portion of our eagle ford shale acreage in mcmullen county  texas and share costs of development drilling in these fields in order to accelerate their development 
objectives in  we are focused on accelerating our pace of development in south texas  improving our results through more efficient execution and exploiting other areas of our asset base 
our exposure to liquids rich production growth in south texas  our oil production in south louisiana  our growing leasehold acreage in the austin chalk and our deep exploration prospect inventory along the gulf coast together provide a uniquely positioned resource portfolio for investors to evaluate 
for  we are targeting an increase in production volumes of to over levels and reserves growth of to over levels 
the company has also begun to explore entering into select joint venture arrangements to help accelerate the drilling and development of particular fields 
results of operations summary prior year comparison in we had revenues of million  an increase of compared to levels 
our weighted average sales price received increased to per boe for from per boe in this million increase in revenues from levels was due to higher oil  natural gas  and ngl prices during  offset somewhat by an decrease in production mainly due to natural declines in our southeast louisiana fields 
our overall costs and expenses decreased in by million when compared to levels  but were higher on a boe basis  as the period included a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties of million in the first quarter 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased  mainly due to higher reserves volumes and lower production when compared to the period  partially offset by a higher depletable property base in the period 
lease operating costs increased by due to higher workover costs  natural gas processing costs  and saltwater disposal costs 
severance and other taxes increased mainly due to increased oil and gas revenues 
our net income for was million  while our net loss in was million 
revenues our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in due to higher oil and gas prices after taking into account decreased production 
average oil prices that we received were higher than those received during  while natural gas prices were higher  and ngl prices were higher 
our revenues in decreased by compared to revenues in primarily due to lower oil and gas prices  as oil  natural gas  and ngl prices we received in were   and lower  respectively  than the average prices we received a year earlier 
our production was adversely affected by hurricanes gustav and ike 
as a result of these hurricanes  approximately mmboe of production was shut in during predominantly in southeast louisiana 
all of this shut in production was brought online in crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  in  and in the remaining production in each year was from natural gas liquids ngls

costs and expenses 
our expenses in decreased million  or  compared to expenses for the reasons noted below 
lease operating expenses loe 
these expenses increased million  or  compared to the level of such expenses in  while costs decreased million  or over levels 
lease operating costs increased during due to higher workover costs and other cost increases from lease supervision and repair maintenance 
these costs decreased in due to decreases in work over costs  decreasing costs for industry goods and services  as well as lower natural gas and ngl processing costs 
clean up and repair costs related to hurricanes gustav and ike totaled million in our lease operating costs per boe produced were   and in   and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
these expenses decreased million  or  in  from levels and decreased million  or in  from levels 
the decrease in was due to lower production and higher reserves  partially offset by a higher depletion base 
the decrease in was due to the write down of oil and gas properties in the first quarter of which lowered our depletable base in addition to lower production  partially offset by lower reserves volumes and higher future development costs 
our dd a rate per boe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions in and decreases in per unit costs for general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  decreased million  or  from the level of such expenses in the increase in was primarily due to higher performance based compensation  partially offset by lower salaries and burdens 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower stock compensation and lower salaries from the workforce reduction in early  partially offset by lower capitalized amounts 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced increased to per boe in from per boe in  compared to per boe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for severance and other taxes 
these expenses increased million  or  from levels  while in these taxes decreased million  or  over levels 
the increases in were due primarily to higher revenues from higher commodity prices 
in the decreases were caused by lower commodity prices and lower production 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily driven by a shift in product and regional mix as well as reduced tax rates for tight sand gas production related to south texas olmos and eagle ford completions 
the increase in was caused by an increase in rates on louisiana natural gas  which increased approximately per mcf produced  along with a slight increase in total revenues from oil production 
interest 
our gross interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt in as compared to prior periods 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our us federal income tax returns for forward  our louisiana income tax returns from forward  our new zealand income tax returns after  and our texas franchise tax returns after remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no material unresolved items related to periods previously audited by these taxing authorities 
no other state returns are significant to our financial position and ceiling test non cash writedowns 
in the first quarter of  as a result of low oil and gas prices at march  we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low oil and natural gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
net income loss 
our net income of million was significantly improved  as compared to a net loss of million which included a million non cash write down of oil and gas properties from the first quarter of and a net loss of million principally due to the million non cash write down of oil and gas properties in december 
if the ceiling test write down of million million after tax and ceiling test write down of million million after tax were to be excluded from and results  s income from continuing operations after tax would have been million  while s income from continuing operations after tax would have been million 
known price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue in future periods 
factors such as worldwide economic conditions and credit availability  worldwide supply disruptions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  and political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices remained high during much of when compared to longer term historical prices but began falling in and continued to fall throughout  showing slight improvement in late and through north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  economic conditions and credit availability  storage levels of natural gas  the level of liquefied natural gas imports  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico may have a direct impact on our costs and operations 
extreme weather conditions in our southeast louisiana areas of activity can increase our costs  adversely affect our operations  and cause equipment or well damage  which damage may not be fully insured  and is no longer being covered by business interruption insurance 
due to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and during periods of increased levels of exploration and production in particular areas  such as we are currently experiencing in the olmos and eagle ford formations  there is increased demand for drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  oilfield services  and trained and experienced personnel 
the high demand in these areas has caused shortages and delays  which has raised costs and often delayed field development 
we extend credit  primarily in the form of uncollateralized oil and gas sales and joint interest owner s receivables  to various companies in the oil and gas industry  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
the concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in economic or other conditions within our industry and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
credit losses in and have been immaterial  we continue to monitor our purchasers of oil and gas for creditworthiness 
we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size  reputation  and nature of the companies to which we extend credit 
for  and  oil and gas sales to shell oil corporation and affiliates were  and of total oil and gas sales  respectively  chevron corporation and its affiliates accounted for of our total oil and gas sales 
from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit or parent company guaranties  if applicable  to reduce risk of loss 
the oil and gas industry is subject to the indirect consequences of regulations that could expose us to risks of increasing environmental laws and regulations and possibly increased costs of operations  delays in obtaining permits and licenses  and reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas  among others 
liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures on a cash flow basis during were million  while our accrual based capital expenditures were million  as we significantly increased our accounts payable and accrued capital cost balances related to capital expenditures in the second half of our cash flow basis amount of capital expenditures increased by million as compared to those in the period mainly due to an increase in our spending on drilling and development in our south texas core area 
these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  and million of proceeds from our public stock offering in november sources of funds net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in revenues  mainly attributable to higher oil and natural gas prices  partially offset by a combination of lower production  higher lease operating costs and higher severance taxes due to higher oil and gas sales 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations represented a decrease from the million generated during  with this decrease primarily due to a million decrease in revenues  mainly attributable to lower oil and natural gas prices in  as well as lower production  partially offset by lower lease operating costs and severance taxes due to lower oil and gas sales 
capital expenditures 
we currently plan to finance our accrual based capital expenditures with our cash flow  cash on hand and potential line of credit borrowings 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at million to million  net of potential dispositions of non strategic properties 
approximately of our capital budget is targeted for our south texas core area 
the company may also explore both joint venture arrangements for particular prospects and select property dispositions  in each case to accelerate drilling and development of its assets and diversify its risk profile 
for  we are targeting an increase in production volumes of to over levels and reserves growth of to over levels 
existing credit facility 
in september we renewed and extended our million credit facility through october  increasing our borrowing base to million from million 
we had no amounts drawn under our credit facility at year end of both and the next scheduled borrowing base review occurs in may our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and expect to remain in compliance with these provisions in future periods 
our available borrowings under our line of credit facility provide us liquidity 
in light of credit market volatility in recent years which caused many financial institutions to experience liquidity issues  we periodically review the creditworthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility 
public stock offering 
we raised million net through an underwritten public stock offering in november  issuing million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the gross proceeds from these sales were approximately million  before deducting underwriting commissions and issuance costs totaling million 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale to expand our south texas drilling program and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility which increased liquidity 
public stock offering 
we raised million net through an underwritten public stock offering in august  issuing million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the gross proceeds from these sales were approximately million  before deducting underwriting commissions and issuance costs totaling million 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility which increased liquidity 
debt issuance and debt retirements 
we issued million of senior notes due in november in december  we redeemed all million of senior notes due and recorded a charge of million related to the redemption of these notes  which is recorded in debt retirement costs on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
financial ratios working capital and debt to capitalization 
our working capital increased from a surplus of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the change primarily resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities plus an increase in accrued capital costs all of which are related to additional drilling activity in south texas during working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  can be used to measure both a company operational efficiency and short term financial health 
the company uses this measure to track our short term financial position 
our debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december   as compared to at year end  as paid in capital increased due to our november stock offering  along with an increase in retained earnings due to our net income for contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation drilling rigs and completion services gas transportation senior notes due senior notes due interest cost credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas and it extends until amounts shown by year are the net present value at december  amounts shown represent fees for the minimum delivery obligations 
any amount of transportation utilized in excess of the minimum will reduce future year obligations the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure pursuant to article a of regulation s k 
proved oil and gas reserves we have added proved reserves over the past three years primarily through our drilling activities  including mmboe added in  mmboe added in  and mmboe added in the proved reserves additions from drilling activities consisted primarily of mmboe of additions to reserves in our south texas area and mmboe of additions in the burr ferry field 
these additions were primarily proved undeveloped additions based on the results of the horizontal drilling program conducted in these areas during the year and would have been recorded as reserves additions under both the former and revised sec reserves regulations 
we obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserves additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this area 
we did not record material proved reserves revisions during as a result of the revised sec reserves regulations 
at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure  an increase in pv of approximately million from the prior year end levels 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmboe  or 
at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of mmboe  or 
our average natural gas price used in the pv calculation for was per mcf 
this average price during was a decrease from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end our average oil price used in the pv calculation for was per bbl 
this average price during was an increase from per bbl at year end  compared to in critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
future development costs are estimated property by property based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
the costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly  on a property by property basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  we evaluate current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  and available geological and geophysical information 
as these factors may change from period to period  our evaluation of these factors will change 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
the calculation of the provision for dd a requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of unproved properties 
for both reserves estimates see discussion below and the impairment of unproved properties see discussion above  these processes are subjective  and results may change over time based on current information and industry conditions 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including natural gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments at december  that would materially affect this calculation 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
see the discussion above related to reserves estimation 
in  as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices at march   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and gas properties 
in the fourth quarter of  we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and gas properties due to lower oil and natural gas prices at the end of given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that additional non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  additional non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur 
new accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued asu to amend oil and gas reserve accounting and disclosure guidance that aligns the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of topic extractive industries oil and gas with the requirements of sec release these releases are effective for financial statements issued on or after january  we have adopted this guidance for all reporting periods ending on or after december  this release changes the accounting and disclosure requirements surrounding oil and natural gas reserves and is intended to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements  to align them with current industry practices and to adapt to changes in technology 
the most significant changes include changes to prices used in reserves calculations  for use in both disclosures and accounting impairment tests 
prices will no longer be based on a single day  period end price 
rather  they will be based on either the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements 
disclosure of probable and possible reserves is allowed 
the estimation of reserves will allow the use of reliable technology that was not previously recognized by the sec 
numerous changes in reserves disclosures mandated by sec for form k 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
these new requirements did not have a material impact upon our reserves estimation or earnings in the current period 
the new rule requiring the preceding month s average price for oil and natural gas resulted in a lower average price for our reserves calculations for than if we had used the previous method utilizing the current price at period end 
these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements in future periods due to the uncertainty of oil and gas prices 
forward looking information the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts  not limited to  statements found in business and properties and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  that involve a number of risks and uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices began in the last half of  and such pricing volatility has continued through with some improvement during the last half of and into our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our credit facility 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
price floors between october and december we entered into additional natural gas price floors 
these price floors cover natural gas production for january to april of  mmbtu with strike prices ranging between and per mmbtu 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had no borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
income tax carryforwards 
as of december   the company has net tax carryforward assets of million for federal net operating losses  for federal alternative minimum tax credits and million  net of a million valuation allowance  for state tax net operating loss carryforwards which in management s judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of the company s us income tax returns in october the company s new zealand subsidiaries have local income tax loss carryovers which are available if any future income is generated by these entities 
as of december  the estimated us dollar value of these loss carryover assets is million 
in management s judgment it is less than more likely than not that the remaining carryover assets will be utilized 
accordingly  these carryover assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  was million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectfully 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  which were issued in november  was million  or of face value and million  or of face value  respectively 
the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  and  while the carrying value of our senior notes due was million and million at december  and  respectively 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit  parent company guaranties if applicable  and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
