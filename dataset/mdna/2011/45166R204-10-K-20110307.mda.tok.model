item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview idenix pharmaceuticals  inc  which we reference together with our wholly owned subsidiaries as idenix  we  us or our  is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
currently  our primary research and development focus is on the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
our hcv discovery program is focused on multiple classes of drugs  which include nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors  protease inhibitors  non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors and nsa inhibitors 
our strategic goal is to develop all oral combinations of direct acting antiviral  or daa  drug candidates that should eliminate the need for interferon and or ribavirin as the current treatment for hcv 
our objective is to develop low dose  once or twice daily agents with broad genotypic activity that have low potential for drug drug interaction  high tolerability and are designed for use in multiple combination regimens 
we will seek to build a combination development strategy  both internally and with partners  to advance the future of hcv treatments 
we believe that nucleosides nucleotides will have a significant role in a combination daa strategy for the treatment of hcv and therefore we are currently concentrating a substantial amount of our discovery efforts on this class of drugs 
we believe we have strong nucleoside nucleotide scientific expertise within our organization and should be able to leverage our intellectual patent portfolio to discover multiple follow ons and novel nucleoside nucleotide drug candidates 
in addition to our strategy of developing drugs for the treatment of hcv  we have also developed products and drug candidates for the treatment of hepatitis b virus  or hbv  human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and acquired immune deficiency syndrome  or aids 
we successfully developed and received worldwide marketing approval for telbivudine tyzeka sebivo  a drug for the treatment of hbv that we licensed to novartis pharma ag  or novartis 
in  we began receiving royalties from novartis based on a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
we also discovered and developed  through proof of concept clinical testing idx  a drug candidate from the class of compounds known as non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  or nnrtis  for the treatment of hiv aids 
we licensed our nnrti compounds  including idx  now known as gsk  or  to glaxosmithkline in february this agreement was assigned to viiv healthcare company  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  which we refer to collectively as gsk 
in february  gsk informed us that the us food and drug administration  or fda  placed on clinical hold 
gsk has full responsibility for the development of  including any regulatory interactions 
in september  the fda placed two of our hcv drug candidates  idx and idx  on clinical hold 
the hold was imposed due to three serious adverse events of elevated liver function tests that were detected during post drug exposure safety visits following a day drug drug interaction study of a combination of idx and idx in healthy volunteers 
we believe the hepatotoxicity observed in this drug drug interaction study was caused by idx and therefore discontinued the clinical development of this drug candidate 
in february  the full clinical hold on idx was removed 
the program was placed on partial clinical hold  which allows us to initiate a phase iib week clinical trial of idx in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with safety evaluations of the patients that will be shared with the fda at certain intervals in the trial 
we anticipate initiating this clinical trial in the second half of 
table of contents the following table summarizes key information regarding our pipeline of hcv drug candidates as well as tyzeka sebivo and idx product drug indication candidates programs description hcv nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors idx following a successfully completed proof of concept clinical trial in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients  we initiated a day dose ranging phase iia clinical trial evaluating idx in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients 
this clinical trial was completed in the third quarter of and demonstrated that idx is safe  well tolerated and has potent hcv antiviral activity 
we anticipate initiating a phase iib week clinical trial in the second half of currently  our discovery efforts are concentrated on this class of drugs to develop multiple follow ons and novel nucleoside nucleotide drug candidates 
protease inhibitors idx in the first quarter of  we completed a double blind  placebo controlled phase i clinical study evaluating single and multiple ascending doses of idx in healthy volunteers 
based on the favorable safety and pharmacokinetic data from the phase i clinical study  we initiated a three day proof of concept clinical trial in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients  which was completed in the third quarter of this three day clinical trial demonstrated that idx had potent hcv antiviral activity 
the idx program was discontinued following the three serious adverse events of liver injury in the day phase i drug drug interaction study of idx and idx  discussed above 
we have follow on drug candidates in the protease inhibitor class that are currently in preclinical development 
we anticipate selecting a clinical candidate with broad genotypic activity in combination daa study idx and idx in the third quarter of  we conducted a day phase i drug drug interaction study of idx and idx in healthy volunteers 
in september  the fda placed these drug candidates on clinical hold due to three serious adverse events of elevated liver function tests that were detected during post drug exposure safety visits following this drug drug interaction study 
we believe the hepatotoxicity observed in this drug drug interaction study was caused by idx and therefore discontinued the clinical development of idx in february  the full clinical hold on idx was removed  which is described in more detail above 
non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor idx in the first quarter of  we submitted a clinical trial application  or cta  for a free acid form of idx in the fourth quarter of  we completed a phase i clinical study evaluating single and multiple doses of idx in healthy volunteers 
based on the favorable safety and pharmacokinetic data from the phase i clinical study  we initiated a three day proof of concept clinical trial in treatment na ve genotype infected patients in the fourth quarter of after three days of dosing with mg  mg and mg of idx administered twice a day  mean hcv viral load reductions were  and log 

iu ml  respectively 
nsa inhibitors during  we selected two lead candidates from our nsa discovery program 
we anticipate selecting a clinical candidate with broad genotypic activity and submitting an investigational new drug  or ind  or a cta in  assuming positive results from ind enabling preclinical studies 
hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside novartis has worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo 
we receive royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor idx or in february  we granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize idx  now known as this drug candidate has progressed through long term chronic toxicology studies and drug drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers 
in the fourth quarter of  gsk initiated a phase iib clinical study of in hiv infected patients 
in february  gsk informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold 
gsk has full responsibility for the development of  including any regulatory interactions 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such drug candidates 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional third party research and development expenses that range from million to million for each drug candidate prior to commercial launch 
our current estimates of additional third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our drug candidates on a project by project basis 

table of contents set forth below were the third party research and development expenses incurred in connection with our significant preclinical studies and clinical trials disease years ended december  indication product drug candidate in thousands hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors    hcv protease inhibitors    hcv non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor    hcv combination daa study hcv preclinical discovery program and other  hbv telbivudine tyzeka sebivo and other hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor as noted in the table above  our current research and development is focused on the treatment of hcv 
in  we had three drug candidates in clinical trials ranging from phase i to phase iia as well as a combination daa study with two of our drug candidates 
these clinical trials resulted in a million increase of hcv related third party expenses as compared to novartis has the option to license our development stage drug candidates after demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical trial so long as novartis maintains at least ownership of our common stock pursuant to our development  license and commercialization agreement with novartis  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement 
if novartis licenses any of our drug candidates  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
in october  novartis waived its option to license idx as a result  we retain the worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  commercialize and license idx we are currently seeking a partner who will assist in the future development and commercialization of this drug candidate 
pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with gsk in february  which we refer to as the gsk license agreement  described more fully below  gsk is solely responsible for the worldwide development  manufacture and commercialization of our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
subject to certain conditions  gsk is also responsible for the prosecution of our patents licensed to gsk under the gsk license agreement 
we do not expect to incur any additional development costs related to our nnrti program  including idx we have incurred significant losses each year since our inception in may and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo and our ability and intent to manage expenditures will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for at least the next months from december  on october   jean pierre sommadossi  phd  resigned from his positions as chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
in connection with dr 
sommadossi s resignation  he will receive severance payments of approximately million  an option grant of approximately million shares and acceleration of all unvested options 
additionally  on october   the board of directors appointed ronald c 
renaud  jr  to serve as president and chief executive officer 
novartis collaboration in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
in may  novartis also purchased approximately of our common stock 
since this date  novartis has had the ability to exercise control over our strategic direction  research and development activities and other materials business decisions 
we derived the majority of our total revenues from novartis in  and through the recognition of license fees  milestone payments  research and development expense reimbursements and royalty payments 
under the collaboration  novartis paid us million of non refundable payments that have been recorded as deferred revenue 
these deferred payments are being recognized over the development period of the licensed drug candidates  which represents the period of our continuing obligations 
additionally  we also receive royalty payments from novartis based on net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
we will continue to recognize revenue related to novartis associated with the non refundable payments as well as the royalty payments 
we also anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis  which may include license fees  development expense funding for our drug candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales  by us or novartis  of our licensed drug candidates 

table of contents glaxosmithkline collaboration in february  we entered into the gsk license agreement 
in october  glaxosmithkline assigned the gsk license agreement to viiv healthcare company  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline 
the gsk license agreement granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
in february  we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with gsk  which we refer to as the gsk stock purchase agreement 
under this agreement  gsk purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or a per share price of 
these agreements became effective in march in march  we received a million payment from gsk  which consisted of a million license fee payment under the gsk license agreement and million under the gsk stock purchase agreement 
in  we received a million milestone payment for the achievement of a preclinical operational milestone and a million milestone payment for the initiation of a phase iib clinical study related to the development of we could also potentially receive up to million in additional milestone payments as well as double digit tiered royalties on worldwide product sales 
in february  gsk informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold 
gsk has full responsibility for the development of  including any regulatory interactions 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party license fee revenue royalty revenue reimbursement of research and development costs other revenue collaboration revenue government grants total revenues collaboration revenue related party consisted of revenue associated with our collaboration with novartis for the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
during the years ended december   and  collaboration revenue related party was comprised of the following license and other fees received from novartis for the license of hbv and hcv drug candidates  net of reductions for novartis stock subscription rights  which is being recognized over the development period of our licensed drug candidates  royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis  and reimbursement by novartis for expenses we incurred in connection with the development and registration of our licensed products and drug candidates  net of certain qualifying costs incurred by novartis 
collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the million decrease in license fee revenue was primarily due to million related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights and million due to adjusting the expected development period of our licensed drug candidates  which represents the period over which we recognize license fee revenue 

table of contents collaboration revenue recognized under the gsk license agreement was million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to the recognition of additional revenue related to the million and million milestone payments received from gsk in a cumulative catch up of million was recognized related to the million milestone payment in the second quarter of and million related to the million milestone payment in the fourth quarter of cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily a result of higher royalty payments due by us to a third party related to the million and million milestone payments received from gsk in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to million of additional expenses in for a phase iia clinical trial of idx  which was initiated in the fourth quarter of  the phase i and proof of concept clinical studies of idx and a combination phase i clinical study of idx and idx  which were initiated in these costs were offset by million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of the restructurings in the united states and europe 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be higher than the amount incurred in mainly related to our plans to initiate a phase iib clinical trial for idx in we plan to seek a partner that will assist in the further development and commercialization of idx  which would reduce future costs associated with idx we will continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  expand our research pipeline and engage in future development activities as we continue to advance our drug candidates and explore collaborations with other entities that we believe will create shareholder value 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to million of severance expense and share based compensation expense related to dr 
sommadossi s resignation in october these costs were offset by million lower consulting fees  salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring in the united states 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be lower than expenses incurred in mainly due to the absence of the severance expense related to dr 
sommadossi s resignation 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in as compared to million in during the first quarter of  we initiated a plan to restructure our operations at our research facility in montpellier  france to reduce its workforce by approximately positions in connection with our ongoing cost saving initiatives 
in the first quarter of  we recorded charges of million for employee severance costs related to the restructuring of our montpellier facility together with charges related to an earlier reduction of our united states workforce by positions in january of this amount  million of the severance costs were paid and the remaining balance of million continued to be accrued as of december  in june  we closed our lab facility in cagliari  italy and eliminated employee positions as a result of continuing cost saving initiatives

in  we also recognized million of collaboration revenue under the gsk license agreement 
cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily a result of higher royalty payments due by us to a third party based on net sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million in lower expenses related to the transfer of the development of idx to gsk pursuant to the gsk license agreement  which we entered into in february we also had million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of employee attrition in the united states and europe as well as the elimination of employee positions associated with the closing of our lab facility in cagliari  italy in june additionally  lab operating costs decreased million and preclinical expenses decreased million due to cost saving initiatives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million in lower consulting fees and million in lower salaries and personnel related costs  mainly related to reduced headcount as a result of employee attrition in the united states

in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  for an indeterminate number of shares of common stock  up to an aggregate of million  for future issuance 
any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis for so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock 
in may  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares pursuant to financing transactions under our existing shelf registration statement so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
pursuant to this shelf registration  in august and in april  we issued approximately million and approximately million shares  respectively  of our common stock pursuant to underwritten offerings and received million and million in net proceeds  respectively 
novartis did not participate in either of these offerings and its ownership was diluted from approximately prior to the august offering to approximately as of february  we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur annual operating losses over the next several years as we continue to expand our drug discovery and development efforts 
we anticipate initiating a phase iib week clinical trial of idx in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in the second half of  which will likely require committing funds in the first half of as a result  we may seek additional funding through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements and are currently seeking a partner who will assist in the future development and commercialization of idx such additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
moreover  any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock must first be approved by novartis so long as novartis continues to own at least of our voting stock  as described above 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the expected royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo and our ability and intent to manage expenditures will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least months from december  however  if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we could be required to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our drug development programs  enter into new collaborative  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements that may not be favorable to us and reduce the number of our employees 
more generally  if we are unable to obtain adequate funding  we may be required to scale back  suspend or terminate our business operations 
as a result of dr

as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in non current marketable securities 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
due to the distress in the financial markets over the past few years certain investments have become less liquid and declined in value 
to mitigate the risk presented by holding illiquid securities  beginning in  we shifted our investments to instruments that carry less exposure to market volatility and liquidity pressures 
as of december   all of our investments were in government agency and treasury money market instruments 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the receipt of payments from gsk pursuant to the gsk license agreement 
in  we received million in milestone payments as compared to million in license fee payments in the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due primarily to less expenses in related to the transfer of the development of idx to gsk and million received from gsk pursuant to the gsk license agreement 
additionally  we incurred less operating expenses in as compared to due to reduced headcount and cost saving initiatives 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in and was due primarily to lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities as compared to this was attributable to lower cash balances invested in marketable securities in and due to the use of cash to fund operations

contractual obligations and commitments set forth below is a description of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases settlement payments and other agreements long term obligations total contractual obligations included in the table above is million related to a settlement agreement we entered into in july with the university of alabama at birmingham  or uab  the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation  or uabrf  an affiliate of uab  and emory university relating to our telbivudine technology 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  all contractual disputes relating to patents covering the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv and all litigation matters relating to patents and patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of idenix  le centre national de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  and the universite montpellier ii  or the university of montpellier  and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo telbivudine for the treatment of hbv have been resolved 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid uabrf on behalf of uab and emory university a million upfront payment and will make additional payments to uabrf equal to of all royalty payments received by us from novartis based on worldwide sales of telbivudine  subject to minimum payment obligations aggregating million 
our payment obligations under the settlement agreement will expire in august the settlement agreement was effective on june  and included mutual releases of all claims and covenants not to sue among the parties 
it also included a release from a third party scientist who had claimed to have inventorship rights in certain idenix cnrs university of montpellier patents 
in connection with certain of our operating leases  we have two letters of credit with a commercial bank totaling million which expire at varying dates through december  as of december   we had million of other long term liabilities recorded 
these liabilities and certain potential payment obligations relating to our hbv and hcv product and drug candidates that are described below are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the cash payments may be made 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with uab which provides for a milestone payment of million to uab upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our former chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also provides that we will pay uab an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
currently  there are no such hcv products approved and therefore there was no related liability recorded as of december  
table of contents we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the universita degli studi di cagliari  or the university of cagliari  pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell certain hcv and hiv technologies 
we made certain payments to the university of cagliari under these arrangements based on the payments we received from gsk under the gsk license agreement 
we are also liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology from novartis  gsk or another collaborator 
in may  we and novartis entered into an amended and restated agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier pursuant to which we worked in collaboration with scientists from cnrs and the university of montpellier to discover and develop technologies relating to antiviral substances  including telbivudine 
this cooperative agreement expired in december  but we retain rights to exploit the patents derived from the collaboration 
under the cooperative agreement  we are obligated to make royalty payments for products derived from such patents 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
in december  we retained the services of clariant subsequently acquired by archimica group  a provider of manufacturing services in the specialty chemicals industry  in the form of a multiproject development and supply agreement 
under the terms of the agreement with clariant  we would  on an as needed basis  utilize the clariant process development and manufacture services in the development of certain of our drug candidates  including telbivudine 
after reviewing respective bids from each of novartis and clariant  the joint manufacturing committee of idenix and novartis decided to proceed with novartis as the primary manufacturer of telbivudine 
in late  we transferred full responsibility to novartis for the development  commercialization and manufacturing of telbivudine 
as a result  in january  we exercised our right under the agreement with clariant to terminate the relationship effective july in february  clariant asserted that they should have been able to participate in the manufacturing process for telbivudine as a non primary supplier and therefore are due an unspecified amount 
we do not agree with clariant s assertion and therefore have not recorded a liability associated with this potential contingent matter 
clariant has not initiated legal proceedings 
if legal proceedings are initiated  we intend to vigorously defend against such lawsuit 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding and evaluating of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and  for revenue arrangements entered into after june   in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
we record revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payments to us for non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalties received from our collaboration partners 

table of contents non refundable license fee payments where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue over the expected development period as we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other performance pattern is evident  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of management 
payments received from collaboration partners for research and development efforts by us are recognized as revenue over the contract term as the related costs are incurred  net of any amounts due to the collaboration partner for costs incurred during the period for shared development costs 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
milestone payments revenues from milestones related to an arrangement under which we have continuing performance obligations  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met a the milestone is non refundable  b achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  c substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and d the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended 
if any of these conditions is not met  the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification of achievement of the milestones by the collaboration partner 
collaboration revenue related party in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
this agreement has several joint committees in which we and novartis participate 
we participate in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the committees span the period from early development through commercialization of drug candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of sab no 
 which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the drug candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we have not attributed revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we have determined that our participation on the committees as such participation relates to the commercialization of drug candidates is protective 
our determination is based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believe our obligation post commercialization is inconsequential 
we recognize non refundable payments received from novartis over the performance period of our continuing obligations 
in the second quarter of  we adjusted the period over which we amortize the deferred payments to be through may based on current judgments related to the product development timeline of our licensed drug candidates 
we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  with the exception of the equity incentive plan  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder  is recorded as a reduction of the non refundable payments associated with the novartis collaboration 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the current date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts will be adjusted through the date that novartis elects to purchase the shares to maintain its percentage ownership based upon changes in the value of our common stock and in novartis percentage ownership 
as of december   the aggregate impact of novartis stock subscription rights has reduced the non refundable payments by million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue with the remaining amount of million as a reduction of license fee revenue 
for the year ended december   the impact of novartis stock subscription rights has increased additional paid in capital by million  decreased deferred revenue by million and decreased license fee revenue by million 
royalty revenue consists of revenue earned under our license agreement with novartis for sales of tyzeka sebivo  which is recognized when reported from novartis 
royalty revenue is equal to a percentage of tyzeka sebivo net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based on the specified territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 

table of contents other revenue in february  we entered into the gsk license agreement and granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
under this agreement  in march  we received a million non refundable license fee payment 
in may  we received a million milestone payment from gsk for the achievement of an operational preclinical milestone related to the development of in november  we received a million milestone payment from gsk for the initiation of a phase iib clinical study of this agreement has performance obligations  including joint committee participation and gsk s right to license other nnrti compounds that we may develop in the future  that we have assessed under the fasb guidance related to multiple element arrangements 
we concluded that this arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized as revenue using the contingency adjusted performance method 
the million payments received from gsk were recorded as deferred revenue and are being recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement  which is estimated to be years 
a cumulative catch up is recognized for the period from the execution of the license agreement in march through the period in which the milestone payments are received 
in february  gsk informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold 
gsk has full responsibility for the development of  including any regulatory interactions 
deferred revenue in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million as deferred revenue  net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
as part of the development and commercialization agreement  novartis will reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed by third parties on our behalf and the associated cost incurred for these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses in which subjective judgments may be required include services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation for employees and directors using a fair value based method that results in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we make assumptions related to the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term of the awards granted in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
the expected option term and expected volatility are determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as those of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
we review these assumptions periodically 
the amounts recognized for share based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest and should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
during  and  because substantially all of our stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated share based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this asu also eliminates the use of the residual method and instead requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
additionally  the guidance expands disclosure requirements with respect to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  although we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  we do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or the results of our operations 
this standard may impact us in the event we complete future transactions or modify existing collaborative relationships 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method 
this asu provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
under the milestone method of revenue recognition  consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety can be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
this standard provides the criteria to be met for a milestone to be considered substantive which includes that a performance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone  and b it relates to past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
this standard is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  although we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  we do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or the results of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment policy seeks to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
the distress in the financial markets over the past few years has caused certain investments to diminish liquidity and decline in value 
due to the failed auctions related to our auction rate security and the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  the market value of our securities may decline further and may prevent us from liquidating our holdings 
to mitigate this risk  beginning in  we began to shift our investments to instruments that carry less exposure to market volatility and liquidity pressures 
as of december   all of our investments were in government agency and treasury money market instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign currency transactions include agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in foreign currencies  european subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies and royalties earned based on worldwide product sales of sebivo by novartis 
as a result of these foreign currency transactions  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
