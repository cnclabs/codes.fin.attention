executive summary we believe we are a leading provider of oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our drilling products and services segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our subsea and well enhancement  drilling products and services and marine segments 
we have expanded geographically into select domestic land and international market areas 
through our subsidiary  wild well control  inc wild well  and our equity method investments  we also own oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
the financial performance of our various products and services are reported in three operating segments subsea and well enhancement  drilling products and services  and marine 
overview of our business segments the subsea and well enhancement segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
we offer a wide variety of services used to maintain  enhance and extend oil and gas production from mature wells 
in  approximately of this segment s revenue was derived from work performed for customers in the gulf of mexico market area down from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area up from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas up from in 
while our income from operations as a percentage of segment revenue tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase our profitability 
the drilling products and services segment is capital intensive with higher operating margins as a result of relatively low operating expenses 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our drilling products and services businesses 
the financial performance is primarily a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from the gulf of mexico market area down from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the domestic land market area up from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas down from in 
three rental products and their ancillary equipment accommodations  drill pipe and stabilization tools each accounted for more than of this segment s revenue in the marine segment is comprised of our rental liftboats 
operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed  and therefore  income from operations as a percentage of revenue can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
with most of our liftboats currently operating in the gulf of mexico  our activity levels can be impacted by harsh weather  especially tropical systems that occur during hurricane season 
market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 

table of contents historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information 
excludes canadian rig count 
as indicated by the table above  the major activity drivers improved in the average number of drilling rigs working in the united states  which is more weighted toward natural gas drilling than oil drilling  increased  while the international rig count  which is more weighted toward oil drilling than natural gas drilling  increased 
the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased while the average price of natural gas at henry hub increased from the following table compares our revenues generated from major geographic regions for the years ended december  and in thousands 
we attribute revenue to countries based on the location where services are performed or the destination of the sale of products 
revenue change gulf of mexico us domestic land international total higher oil prices  the increase in drilling rig counts particularly the number of horizontal drilling rigs in the domestic land market area and higher overall industry activity increased pricing and utilization for our products and services in all segments  where our domestic land revenue increased to million 
in this market area  we experienced a increase in revenue from our subsea and well enhancement segment and a increase in revenue from our drilling products and services segment 
within individual product and service lines  the largest increases in the domestic land market area were in coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  pressure control tools  rentals of accommodations and rentals and sales of stabilizers and related equipment 
our gulf of mexico revenue declined to million due primarily to the deepwater drilling moratorium and lack of new deepwater drilling permits issued following the deepwater horizon incident in april  which curtailed demand for our drilling products and services 
in addition  we generated less revenue from special projects as a result of the conclusion of field work on our large scale decommissioning project 
finally  our gulf of mexico liftboat revenue declined as a result of downtime for our two foot class liftboats  which did not return to service until october and november these liftboats typically generate dayrates of approximately  our international revenue increased to million due primarily to the acquisition of hallin marine subsea international plc hallin in january  and increases in demand for down hole drilling products in latin america and hydraulic workover and snubbing services in europe 

table of contents industry outlook we believe drivers of industry demand  commodity prices and drilling rig counts should remain favorable in most geographic market area  with the exception of the gulf of mexico 
we believe domestic land market areas with high concentrations of horizontal drilling remain underserved for products and services such as coiled tubing  premium drill pipe and ancillary products 
internationally  we will continue to build out market areas  such as brazil  that provide us the best opportunities to provide as many products and services as possible 
as a result  we anticipate that we will continue to grow revenue and earnings from international market areas  but at a slower  more measured pace than the domestic land market area 
accordingly  a significant portion of our capital expenditures in will be allocated to these areas 
our gulf of mexico operations generally focus on three areas drilling support  production enhancement and decommissioning or end of life services 
our exposure to drilling activity is primarily in the drilling products and services segment 
we anticipate that our financial performance from the gulf of mexico in this segment will continue to be curtailed due to the lack of drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico market area as a result of the aftermath of the deepwater horizon incident 
the industry continues in its efforts to interpret and comply with new government regulations to obtain new drilling permits 
the pace at which new permits are issued and rigs resume drilling will drive demand for our drilling products and services 
operations in our subsea and well enhancement and marine segments are primarily focused on production enhancement and end of life activities in the shallow water gulf of mexico 
a new regulatory initiative aimed at removing idle iron in the gulf of mexico may increase long term demand for our plug and abandonment and decommissioning services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  long term construction accounting  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the fair value of those assets is less than their respective carrying amount 
fair value is measured  in part  by the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels and operating performance 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
assets are grouped by subsidiary or division for the impairment testing  except for liftboats  which are grouped together by leg length 
these groupings represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have long lived assets  such as facilities  utilized by multiple operating divisions that do not have identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing for these long lived assets is based on the consolidated entity 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the 
table of contents predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  after a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of liftboat components primarily related to two partially constructed foot class liftboats  we determined that it was impractical to finish the construction of these two vessels 
as such  we recorded approximately million of a reduction in the value of these tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the marine segment see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item 
we will utilize the remaining components of these vessels as spares for our existing fleet 
during the second quarter of  we recorded approximately million of impairment expense in connection with our intangible assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment 
this reduction in value of intangible assets was primarily due to the decline in demand for services in the domestic land market area 
during the fourth quarter of  the domestic land market area remained depressed and our forecast of this market did not suggest a timely recovery sufficient to support our current carrying values 
as such  we recorded approximately million of impairment expense related to our tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the same segment see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance related to goodwill and other intangibles  which requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on carrying value and our estimate of fair value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our business segments using various cash flow and earnings projections discounted at a rate estimated to approximate the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
based on business conditions and market values that existed at december   we concluded that no goodwill impairment loss was required 
even though we recognized a million reduction in the value of liftboat components within the marine segment in  the estimated future cash flows used in the fair value calculation of this segment from the remainder of the fleet was more than sufficient to support the carrying value of this reporting unit 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding the customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are 
table of contents provided and collectability is reasonably assured 
we contract for marine  subsea and well enhancement and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
the products we rent within our drilling products and services segment are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
long term construction accounting for revenue and profit loss recognition 
a portion of our revenue is derived from long term contracts 
for contracts that meet the criteria under the authoritative guidance related to construction type and production type contracts  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and profitability for contracts currently in process 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
to the extent that an adjustment in the estimated total contract cost impacts estimated profit of the contract  the cumulative change to revenue and profitability is reflected in the period in which this adjustment in estimate is identified 
the accuracy of the revenue and estimated earnings we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance and contract revenue and costs 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our contract to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and related well facilities located in the gulf of mexico 
during the fourth quarter of  as the project to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and well facilities neared completion  we determined it was necessary to increase the total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  third party liability insurances  property damage  and group medical 
with our growth  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have actuarial reviews of our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  wild well  and our equity method investments  spn resources and dbh  acquire mature oil and gas properties and assume the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
each of these entities follows the successful efforts method of accounting for their investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful developmental wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
wild well s property purchase was recorded at the value exchanged at closing  combined with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs and well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of each field 
we estimate the third party market price to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 

table of contents if the liability exceeds or is less than our incurred costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use twelve month average prices  year end costs and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share 
included in the results for the year ended december  were pre tax management transition expenses of approximately million  as well as non cash pre tax charges of million for the reduction in value of assets within our marine segment 
for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and net loss was million  or loss per share 
net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the reduction in value of assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment and million for the reduction in value of our remaining equity method investment in beryl oil and gas lp bog 
also included in the results for the year ended december  were losses of million from our share of equity method investments and million of other non cash charges related to spn resources

table of contents the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 
subsea and well enhancement segment revenue for our subsea and well enhancement segment was  million for the year ended december   as compared to million for our increase in revenue and profitability is primarily due to demand increases in the domestic land and international market areas 
revenue from our domestic land market area increased approximately due to demand for coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
additionally  revenue from our international market areas increased approximately primarily due to our acquisition of hallin along with increased revenue from our well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area decreased approximately primarily based on a decline in revenue from work associated with our large scale decommissioning project 
this decrease was partially offset by increased well control work and plug and abandonment activity  as well as our acquisitions of superior completion services and the bullwinkle platform 
cost of services decreased to of segment revenue in  as compared to of segment revenue in similar to revenue  our profitability increased due to increased demand for coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
additionally  cost of services as a percentage of revenue for was impacted due to the adjustment related to our large scale decommissioning project 
during the fourth quarter of as we neared completion of this project  we determined it was necessary to increase our total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project 
as the revenue related to this long term contract is recorded on the percentage of completion method utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs  the cumulative effect of changes to estimated total contract costs was recognized in the period in which revisions were identified 
drilling products and services segment revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services increased to of segment revenue in from in the increase in revenue for this segment is primarily related to rentals of our accommodation units and specialty tubulars  specifically in our domestic land market area 
revenue in our domestic land market area increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in revenue generated from our international market areas increased approximately 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area decreased approximately due to decreased demand for specialty tubulars and stabilization equipment as a result of the lingering effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium 
the decrease in demand for specialty tubulars was partially offset by an increase in demand for accommodation rentals  which benefited from oil spill cleanup efforts 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased as rentals from high margin drill pipe  specialty tubulars and stabilization equipment fell significantly in the gulf of mexico due to the deepwater drilling moratorium 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
our cost of services percentage increased to of segment revenue for the year ended december  from in primarily due to increased liftboat inspections and maintenance costs coupled with decreased revenue 
due to the high fixed cost nature of this segment  cost of services does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue 
the fleet s average utilization increased to approximately in from in however  the fleet s average dayrate decreased to approximately  in from  in the average dayrate decreased as several of our larger liftboats were not available for work due to inspections and repairs 
both of our foot class liftboats were out of service for an extended period of time for us coast guard inspections 
additionally  our two completed foot class liftboats recently returned to service in october and november of after being out of service for repairs since november in december  we also sold one of our foot class liftboats for million and recorded a gain of approximately million 

table of contents depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense related to our subsea and well enhancement segment increased million  or  in from the same period in increases in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion related to the acquisitions of superior completion services  hallin and the bullwinkle platform  along with and capital expenditures  were offset by the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a result of the million reduction in value of assets related to our domestic land market area recorded in depreciation and amortization expense increased within our drilling products and services segment by million  or  due to and capital expenditures 
depreciation expense related to the marine segment decreased million  or 
the decrease in depreciation expense in our marine segment is attributable to the fact that our foot class liftboats were out of service for an extended period of time for us coast guard inspections and our two completed foot class liftboats returned to service in the october and november of after being out of the service for repairs since november general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in included in this increase is approximately million of management transition expenses 
additional increases in general and administrative expenses include the acquisitions of superior completion services and hallin  as well as increased bonus and compensation expense due to our improved performance  and additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 
reduction in value of assets during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reduction in the value of assets totaling million in connection with liftboat components primarily related to our two partially completed foot class liftboats 
after a detailed evaluation  we concluded in december that it was impractical to complete these vessels 
as such  we reduced our carrying value in these assets to their respective net realizable value and will utilize the remaining components as spares for our existing fleet 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an expense of approximately million in connection with intangible assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment 
this reduction in value of intangible assets was primarily due to the decline in demand for services in the domestic land market area 
during the fourth quarter of  the domestic land market area remained depressed and our forecast of this market did not suggest a timely recovery sufficient to support our current carrying values 
as such  we recorded an expense of approximately million related to our tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the same segment 
additionally in  we recorded a million expense to write off our remaining investment in bog  an equity method investment in which we owned a interest 
in april  bog defaulted under its loan agreements due primarily to the impact of production curtailments from hurricanes gustav and ike in and the decline of natural gas and oil prices 
as a result of continued negative bog operating results  lack of viable interested buyers and unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate the terms and conditions of bog s loan agreements  we wrote off the remaining carrying value of our investment in bog

additionally  our revenue from a large scale platform decommissioning project decreased approximately due to the combination of less work being performed coupled with an increase in the estimated total cost of this project 
during the fourth quarter of as we neared completion of this project  we determined it was necessary to increase our total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project 
as the revenue related to this long term contract is recorded on the percentage of completion method utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs  the cumulative effect of changes to estimated total contract costs was recognized in the period in which revisions were identified

however  during  we incurred substantial costs for maintenance to our liftboat fleet 
additionally  we benefited from a decrease in insurance expense in as a result of our favorable loss history and more competitive marine insurance markets 
in the fourth quarter of  our two foot class liftboats were removed from service following damage to one of the vessels during hurricane ida 
both vessels returned to service in the fourth quarter of additionally  we sold four liftboats from our foot class for approximately million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
oil and gas segment in march  we sold of our interest in spn resources for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain on sale of this business of approximately million 
spn resources represented substantially all of our oil and gas segment

liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to the billings and receipt of payments related to the large scale decommissioning contract in the gulf of mexico 
included in other current assets is approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to this project 
billings  and subsequent receipts  are based on the completion of milestones 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  and to fund capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   million was held in a foreign account in anticipation of the january acquisition of hallin 
we spent million of cash on capital expenditures during the year ended december  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our drilling products and services equipment inventory  approximately million was spent on our marine segment and approximately million was used to expand and maintain the asset base of our subsea and well enhancement segment 
in august  we acquired certain assets used in baker hughes gulf of mexico stimulation and sand control business currently operating as superior completion services  for approximately million of cash 
baker hughes was required to divest this business by the department of justice in connection with its acquisition of bj services company 
the acquisition of these assets  along with a manufacturing facility and related product line  provides us greater exposure to well completions and intervention projects earlier in the life cycle of the well 
in january  we acquired hallin for approximately million of cash

this exchange rate is equal to an initial exchange price of per share 
the exchange price represents a premium over the closing share price at the date of issuance 
the notes may be exchanged under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of the notes for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  prior to december   during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price of  principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the exchange rate on such trading day  if the notes have been called for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or at any time beginning on september   and ending at the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date of december  holders of the senior exchangeable notes may also require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on december   december  and december  subject to certain administrative formalities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for our international operations  other than certain operations in the united kingdom and europe  is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of certain subsidiaries in the united kingdom and europe are translated at end of period exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
when we believe prudent  we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
