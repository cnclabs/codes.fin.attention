the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
introduction we are a worldwide organization and leading designer and manufacturer of inverters for the renewable energy industry and hundreds of high quality brand name ac dc and dc dc power supplies  converters  and power management products for the servers  storage  networking  network power systems and industrial markets 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oem  distributors  engineering  procurement and construction epc firms  and service providers who value quality  reliability  technology and service 
we have established a broad and global customer base 
we are organized into two sbus  renewable energy solutions and power solutions 
the sbus were created during fiscal to focus on both the products and services we provide and the customers and end markets that we serve 
due to the structure of our internal organization and the manner in which expenses were tracked and managed and as a result of the design of our internal systems during fiscal  we are unable to recast our financial statements by operating segment for fiscal and prior 
as such  segment information  other than revenue  for the years ended january  and december   is not reported as it is impracticable to do so 
renewable energy solutions we offer inverters  management systems  accessories and services for the renewable energy market place that includes both photovoltaic solar and wind applications 
in the renewable energy market  we sell a broad product line of inverters and service offerings that provide our customers with industry leading efficiency  harvesting power  uptime  reliability  monitoring through software and ease of installation 
we sell our renewable energy products to distributors installers  epcs and oems 
we are engaged in the design and production of inverters for renewable energy products that convert photovoltaic solar or wind energy into useable ac power 
our string 
table of contents inverters are used in residential and small commercial applications  while our central inverters are designed for large commercial and utility installations for both the solar and wind markets 
these products scale in size from kw up to mw 
the recent acquisition of the assets of a software firm expanded our product offering by providing our customers with greater control and monitoring of their renewable energy assets using this software as a service saas platform 
power solutions our power conversion and power management solutions are used in computer servers  data storage  networking  telecommunications and industrial applications 
we sell our power conversion products to oems  distributors  and service providers 
we are engaged in the design and production of the following power conversion products ac dc power supplies that convert ac from a primary power source  such as a wall outlet  into a precisely controlled dc voltage 
virtually every electronic device that plugs into an ac wall outlet requires some type of ac dc power supply  and we provide a broad range of supplies that power a wide variety of oem equipment  dc power systems that are used by communications and internet service providers to power their equipment  and are used as backup power for large communications infrastructure equipment  dc dc converters that modify an existing dc voltage level to a different dc voltage level to meet the power needs of various subsystems and components within electronic equipment 
our dc dc converters include high density and low density brick converters that are generally used to control power on communications printed circuit boards and also include point of load pol converters that power devices within an intermediate bus architecture as well as in other applications  and additional products that include digital control products for motors and a variety of other application specific specialty power products 
we are focused on improving our operational and financial performance and have implemented detailed plans to improve our performance  drive long term growth and profitability  improve on time delivery  and reduce manufacturing inefficiencies 
the operating framework in which we manage our business and guide our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers targeted growth  operational efficiency and capital strategy 
our top strategic objective is to grow our market share in both the renewable energy and power conversion markets  while expanding profitability 
we plan to grow revenue through geographic expansion and introducing new product offerings 
to support our objectives  we have launched new product introductions and will continue to invest in our go to market strategy by expanding both the sales and service teams and our research and development r d resources  as well as investing in new market leading technologies 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we strengthened our r d team by hiring additional engineers in connection with the acquisition of the assets of a software firm 
this acquisition included software that provides critical insight into revenue generating renewable energy assets and provides a remote monitoring and asset management solution  increasing the value to our customers of our inverters  and adding experienced software engineers to our renewable energy sbu 
the solutions identify and address problematic assets  allowing energy producers to increase energy harvest and performance ratios  cut the costs of operations maintenance  reduce operational and financial risk  and improve return on investment 
in addition  we are investing in our supply chain and manufacturing capacity 
we have expanded our capacity in our european plants and are adding production capacity in the united states  china and canada to meet the increased demand of the renewable energy market 

table of contents as part of our initiative to increase profitability  we improved gross margin in by driving manufacturing and design efficiencies and focusing our supply chain on targeting cost reductions 
while our supply chain organization actively manages component costs  it also manages component shortages that we are currently addressing in both the renewable energy and power solutions businesses in order to mitigate any negative impacts that these shortages may have on material costs and on meeting our customers demands 
lastly  we are continuing our initiatives to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our working capital performance 
in an effort to reduce dilution  we repurchased million in face value of the senior secured convertible notes due during the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a net loss of million 
in addition  we repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock in open market transactions for approximately million during fiscal critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts may be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  restructuring costs  goodwill impairment  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  sales returns and discounts  warranty costs  uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred tax assets  stock compensation  business combinations and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and as areas most dependent on management judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment or at the time of inventory consumption for customers on vendor managed inventory vmi programs because this is the point at which revenue is earned and realizable and the earnings process is complete 
for most shipments  title to shipped goods transfers at the shipping point  so the risks and rewards of ownership transfer once the product leaves our warehouse 
for shipments in which title transfers at a later date  revenue recognition is delayed 
revenue is only recognized when collectability is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we may charge shipping and handling costs to customers  which are included in revenue 
we offer our distributors a standard agreement which includes payment terms  description of rights to return or exchange product  and price discounts 
under our standard agreement  payment is due within days of shipment of the product to the distributors 
the distributor has a right to return only if we discontinue a product that the distributor has on hand 
the distributor has a right to exchange up to of the dollar value of products purchased within the prior six month period  so long as the distributor is currently purchasing at least the equivalent dollar value in new product 
estimated product exchanges or returns are accrued for at the time of the sale based on historical information in accordance with asc revenue recognition products 
finally  we may give price discounts to a distributor at the time a purchase order is received from the distributor for product that they will sell to a specific customer 
the price discount is available for one year following issuance of the purchase order for items listed on the purchase order 
we accrue for the estimated price discount at the time revenue is recognized 

table of contents we have a joint venture in asia which  along with certain of our contract manufacturers  may purchase raw components and other goods from power one  and sell finished goods back to power one as well as to other third parties 
we record revenue on sales to the joint venture and contract manufacturers only when the components and goods are for sales to third parties 
when the joint venture or contract manufacturers purchase components that will be assembled and sold back to us  no revenue is recorded because the earnings process has not been completed 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in asc property  plant  and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  it is written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or other information available in the market  depending on the nature of the assets 
methodologies for determining fair value are inherently based on estimates that may change  such as the useful lives of assets and our cash flow forecasts associated with certain assets 
a change in these estimates may result in impairment charges  which would impact our operating results 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets using the methodology prescribed in asc intangibles goodwill and other 
asc requires that we not amortize goodwill  but instead subject it to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
these impairment tests are also dependent on management forecasts  which frequently change 
a change in our forecasts may result in impairment charges 
asc requires the company to perform a two step impairment test 
under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we are required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and we do not perform the second step 
if the results of the first step impairment test indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit does not exceed its carrying amount  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each august fiscal month 
as a result of the continued decrease in our market capitalization during the first fiscal quarter of  we tested our goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was impaired 
as our carrying value exceeded our estimated fair value as of march   we applied the approach prescribed in asc for determining the impairment amount 
as a result of the interim test  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  restructuring charges we record restructuring charges in accordance with asc exit or disposal cost obligations and asc compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  as applicable 
asc requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan 
in accordance with the guidance provided under asc  we accrue for severance expenses prior to notification for termination benefits that are contractual or required by regional labor laws or are pursuant to a substantive plan where the costs are deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
restructuring costs were related to the downsizing of operations and primarily consisted of specific charges that had been incurred or were to be incurred with no future economic benefit 
these charges included costs related to personnel severance  continuing lease obligations for vacant facilities  and certain contract termination penalties and other shutdown costs 
calculation of the restructuring 
table of contents reserves includes management judgment regarding closed facilities  which include assumptions about the length of time it will take for facilities to be subleased as well as the likely sublease income amount 
changes in these estimates may impact our operating results 
income taxes we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where the company generates a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with asc  income taxes  when  in management judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we record uncertain tax positions under the provisions of asc we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the positions 
under these provisions  we must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and will have full knowledge of all relevant information 
for each income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we then assess the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
unrecognized tax positions  if ever recognized in the financial statements  are recorded in the statement of operations as part of the income tax provision 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventory are written down quarterly based on a comparison of on hand quantities to historical and projected usages 
additionally  reserves for non cancelable open purchase orders for components we are obligated to purchase in excess of projected usage  or for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price  are recorded as other accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
calculation of inventory write downs is based on management assumptions regarding projected usage of each component  which are subject to changes in market demand 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method and also provide a reserve in the aggregate 
our estimates for calculating the aggregate reserve are based on historical information 
any changes to our assumptions or estimates may impact our operating results 
business combinations we account for our acquisitions utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total consideration paid is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  identifiable intangible assets in particular  is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to estimates of revenue growth rates  estimates of rates of return  royalty rates  and determination of appropriate discount rates 
these assumptions are generally made based on available historical information 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives

debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from financial debt instruments that we enter

however  under no circumstances do we enter into derivative or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in market interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
for example  in europe our variable long term debt bears interest on borrowings outstanding at various time intervals and is based on the euro interbank offered rate euribor 
our principal risk with respect to our variable long term debt is to changes in this market rate
