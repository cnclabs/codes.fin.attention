item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a marshall islands company that transports iron ore  coal  grain  steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels 
as of march   excluding baltic trading  our fleet consisted of nine capesize  eight panamax  supramax  six handymax and ten handysize drybulk carriers  with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt  and the average age of our fleet is currently years  as compared to the average age for the world fleet of approximately years for the drybulk shipping segments in which we compete 
most of the vessels in our fleet are on time charters to well known charterers  including lauritzen bulkers  cargill  pacbasin  stx  cosco  and hmmc 
as of march   of the vessels in our fleet  excluding baltic trading  are presently engaged unde r time charter and spot market related time charter contracts that expire assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised between april and june  and five of our vessels are currently operating in vessel pools 
see pages for a table indicating the built dates of all vessels currently in our fleet 
in addition  baltic trading s fleet currently consists of two capesize  four supramax and three handysize drybulk carriers with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt 
we intend to acquire additional modern  high quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions of vessels in a manner that is accretive to our cash flow 
we expect to fund acquisitions of additional vessels using cash reserves set aside for this purpose  additional borrowings and may consider additional debt and equity financing alternatives from time to time 
our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet 
commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels  managing the mix of various types of charters  such as time charters and voyage charters  and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters 
strategic management includes locating  purchasing  financing and selling vessels 
we currently contract with three independent technical managers  to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in house 
technical management involves the day to day management of vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
members of our new york city based management team oversee the activities of our independent tech nical managers 
from time to time in the current global economic environment  our charterers with long term time charters may request to renegotiate the terms of our charters with them 
as a general matter  we do not agree to make changes to the terms of our charters in response to such requests 
the failure of any charterer to meet its obligations under our long term time charters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
baltic trading  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  completed its ipo on march  as of december   the company s wholly owned subsidiary genco investments llc owned  shares of baltic trading s class b stock  which represents a ownership interest in baltic trading at december  and of the aggregate voting power of baltic trading s outstanding shares of voting stock 
baltic trading is consolidated with the company  as we control a majority of the voting interests in baltic trading

management fee income we earn from the management agreement net of any allocated shared expenses  such as salary  office expenses and other general and administrative fees  will be taxable to us 
upon consolidation with baltic trading  any management fee income earned will be eliminated for financial reporting purposes 
we provide technical services for drybulk vessels purchased by mep under an agency agreement between us and mep 
these services include oversight of crew management  insurance  drydocking  ship operations and financial statement preparation  but do not include chartering services 
the services are provided for a fee of per ship per day plus reimbursement of out of pocket costs and will be provided for an initial term of one year

during the beginning of  the genco cavalier  a built supramax vessel  was on charter to samsun when samsun filed for a rehabilitation application 
on february   the rehabilitation plan submitted by samsun was approved by the south korean courts 
as part of the rehabilitation process  our claim of approximately million will be settled in the following manner  or approximately million  will be paid in cash in annual installments on december th of each year from through ranging in percentages from eight to  the remaining  or approximately million  will be converted to samsun shares at a specified value per share 
during the year ended december   we have recorded millio n as other operating income which represents of cash settlement due on december  during january  the genco success  a built handymax vessel  was on charter to klc when klc filed for a rehabilitation application 
at december   we have limited exposure as a result of the bankruptcy protection filing by klc 
the vessel was redelivered to us by klc on january  we estimate that we have a claim of approximately million against klc related primarily to unpaid revenue earned prior to re delivery of the vessel 
if a rehabilitation plan is approved by the south korean courts and it is determined that we will receive a cash settlement for our outstanding claim  any amounts due from klc will be recorded once the collectibility of the receivable has been assessed and the amount has been deemed collectible

ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
we define tce rates as net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
for the years ended december  voyage revenues in thousands voyage expenses in thousands total available days total tce rate we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking  the costs of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses

our vessel operating expenses  which generally represent fixed costs  will increase as a result of the expansion of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crewing  lubes  and insurance  may also cause these expenses to increase

as such  a dividend has not been declared during and as a result of the amendment to the credit facility  we have suspended the payment of cash dividends effective for the fourth quarter of  and payment of cash dividends will remain suspended until we can meet the collateral maintenance covenant contained in the credit facility 
the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenant  which is currently waived 
the timing and amount of dividend payments will depend on our earnings  financial condition  cash requirements and availability  fleet renewal and expansion  restrictions in our loan agreements  the provisions of marshall islands law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders and other factors 
our board of directors may review and amend our dividend policy from time to time in light of our plans for future growth and other factors 
we believe that  under current law  our dividend payments from earnings and profits will constitute qualified dividend income and  as such  will generally be subject to a us federal income tax rate with respect to non corporate us shareholders that meet certain holding period and other requirements through

the credit fa cility was amended as of february  to permit the share repurchase program and provide that the dollar amount of shares repurchased is counted toward the maximum dollar amount of dividends that may be paid in any fiscal quarter 
subsequently  on january   we entered into the amendment  which amended the credit facility to require us to suspend all share repurchases until we can represent that we are in a position to again satisfy the collateral maintenance covenant

the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a similar amount of net income for each period before considering significantly higher depreciation and amortization due to the operation of a larger fleet  as well as the impact of the amortization of time charters acquired 
net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to cash used for the purchase of baltic trading s nine vessels  the delivery of vessels from bourbon and metrostar during the third quarter of and the deposits made for the acquisition of vessels during the second quarter of for the twelve months ended december   cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase of vessels in the amount of million and the deposit on vessels yet to be delivered in the amount of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million during the twelve months ended december  as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the amount of million from the initial public offering for baltic trading that was completed on march   million of proceeds from the million term loan facility related to the bourbon vessels acquired  million of proceeds from the million term loan facility related to the metrostar vessels acquired  million of proceeds from the issuance of the notes and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and million of proceeds from the baltic trading credit facility

we had entered into a number of short term forward currency contracts to protect ourselves from the risk associated with the fluctuation in the exchange rate associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares as described in note investments of our consolidated financial statements 
as forward contracts expired  we continued to enter into new forward currency contracts for the cost basis of the investment  excluding commissions 
however  hedge accounting is limited to the lower of the cost basis or the market value at time of designation 
we elected to discontinue the forward currency contracts as of october  due to the declining underlying market value of jinhui 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements  or ffas  to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
these arrangements may include future contracts  or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners  charters and traders 
generally  these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
although ffas can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into ffas  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
it is not currently our intention to enter into ff as to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels 
if we determine to enter into ffas  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market

we are obligated to pay certain commitment fees in connection with all of our credit facilities  which have been reflected within interest and borrowing fees 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
excluding baltic trading s vessels  our fleet currently consists of nine capesize drybulk carriers  eight panamax drybulk carriers  supramax drybulk carriers  six handymax drybulk carriers and ten handysize drybulk carriers 
baltic trading s fleet currently consists of two capesize drybulk carriers  four supramax drybulk carriers and three handysize drybulk carriers 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings 
we estimate our drydocking costs and scheduled off hire days for our fleet through to be year estimated drydocking cost estimated off hire days us dollars in millions the costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in china 
we estimate that each drydock will result in days of off hire 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs

inflation inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions 
in the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear  these pressures would increase our operating  voyage  general and administrative  and financing costs 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for an additional description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this k 
time charters acquired when a vessel is acquired with an existing time charter  we allocate the purchase price of the vessel and the time charter based on  among other things  vessel market valuations and the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired charters of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the charter terms and ii management s estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the charter 
the capitalized above market assets and below market liabilities charters are amortized as a reduction or increase  respectively  to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter 
during the year ended december   we acquired two supramax vessels from bourbon and two handysize vessels from metrostar had existing below market time charters at the time that we agreed to acquire these vessels 
we recorded a liability for time charters acquired related to these five vessels in the amount of million based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid and our estimate of the fair market charter rate 
in order to calculate the present value  we utilized a discount rate of 
if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in an increase in the liability balance of approximately  if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in a decrease in the liability balance of approximately performance claims revenue is based on contracted charterparties  including spot market related time charters which rates fluctuate based on changes in the spot market 
however  there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights 
in particular  disagreements may arise as to the responsibility of lost time and revenue due to us as a result 
additionally  there are certain performance parameters included in contracted charterparties which if not met  can result in customer claims 
accordingly  we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimate a provision if there is a possibility of non recoverability 
at each balance sheet date  we provide a provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables and we also will accrue for any estimated customer claims primarily a result of time charter performance issues tha t have not yet been deducted by the charterer 
we provide for reserves which offset the due from charterers balance if a disputed amount or performance claim has been deducted by the charterer 
if a disputed amount or potential performance claim has not been deducted by the charterer  we record the estimated customer claims as deferred revenue 
providing for these reserves will be offset by a decrease in revenue 
although we believe its provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made  it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate 
vessels and depreciation we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be per lightweight ton 
an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
how ever  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use 
the carrying value each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels  which could be more or less 
under us gaap  we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel excluding its charter is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired as discussed below under impairment of long lived assets 
excluding the three bourbon vessels we resold immediately upon delivery to mep at our cost  we have sold three of our vessels since our inception and realized a profit in each instance 
pursuant to our bank credit facilities  we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to evidence our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our bank credit facilities 
such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale  which may be more or less  and should not be relied upon as such 
we were in compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our million term loan facility and our million term loan facility  as well as the baltic trading credit facility  at december   and the collateral maintenance covenant under our credit facility was waived at december   as discussed above 
in the chart below  we list each of our vessels  the year it was built  the year we acquired it  and its carrying value at decem ber  we have indicated by an asterisk those vessels for which the vessel valuations for covenant compliance purposes under our bank credit facilities as of the most recent compliance testing date were lower than their carrying values at december  for the genco ocean and the genco bay  the compliance testing date was february   in accordance with the terms of the million term loan facility  for all other vessels  the compliance testing date was december   in accordance with the terms of the applicable credit facility 
the amount by which the carrying value at december  of vessels marked with an asterisk exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged  on an individual vessel basis  from million to million per vessel 
however  neither such valuation nor the carrying value in the table below reflects the value of long term time charters related to some of our vessels  which c an be significant 
vessels year built year acquired carrying value us dollars in thousands genco reliance genco vigour genco explorer genco carrier genco sugar genco pioneer genco progress genco wisdom genco success genco beauty genco knight genco leader genco marine genco prosperity genco muse genco acheron genco surprise genco augustus genco tiberius genco london genco titus genco challenger genco charger genco warrior genco predator genco hunter genco champion genco constantine genco raptor genco cavalier genco thunder genco hadrian genco commodus genco maximus genco claudius genco bay genco ocean genco aquitaine genco ardennes genco auvergne genco bourgogne genco brittany genco languedoc genco loire genco lorraine genco normandy genco picardy genco provence genco pyrenees baltic leopard baltic panther baltic cougar baltic jaguar baltic bear baltic wolf baltic wind baltic cove baltic breeze total please see paragraph preceding the table 
on december   the company took delivery of the genco claudius 
however  the vessel has been designated by lloyd s register of shipping as having been built in deferred drydocking costs our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings 
deferred drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard  cost of travel  lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise  and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with us gaap guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
costs that are not related to drydocking are expensed as incurred 
if the vessel is drydocked earlier than originally anticipated  any remaining deferred drydock costs that have not been amortized are expensed at the beginning of the next drydock 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the accounting standards codification asc subtopic  property  plant and equipment asc which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
if indicators of impairment are present  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long lived assets 
the current economic and market conditions  including the significant disruptions in the global credit markets  are having broad effects on participants in a wide variety of industries 
since mid august  the charter rates in the dry bulk charter market have declined significantly  and drybulk vessel values have also declined both as a result of a slowdown in the availability of global credit and the significant deterioration in charter rates 
when indicators of impairment are present and our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessel s carrying value  the carrying value is written down  by recording a charge to operations  to the vessel s fair market value if the fair market value is lower than the vessel s carrying value 
the company noted that tce revenues across its fleet were lower on average in compared with this was more of a function of vessels coming off charters that had been fixed in periods of higher tce rates as opposed to lower market rates 
the company s management views the lower tce rates in as part of a longer term economic cycle 
the company concluded at december  that the future income streams expected to be earned by such vessels over their remaining operating lives on an undiscounted basis would be sufficient to recover their carrying values and that  accordingly  our vessels were not impaired under us gaap 
our estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded each of our vessels carrying values by a considerable margin of carrying value 
our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately years in which to recover sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of december  management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in the markets in which it participates with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period of time that are utilized in the analyses 
in developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  we make assumptions and estimates about the vessels future performance  with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates  fleet utilization  vessels operating expenses  vessels capital expenditures and drydocking requirements  vessels residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel 
the assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on historical trends 
the projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining life of the vessel  assumed to be years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard  reduced by brokerage commissions  expected outflows for vessels maintenance and vessel operating expenses including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation  assuming fleet utilization of 
the salvage value used in the impairment test is estimated to be per light weight ton  consistent with our vessels depreciation policy discussed above 
although we believe that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
there can be no assurance as to how long charter rates and vessel values will remain at their currently low levels or whether they will improve by any significant degree 
charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability  and future assessments of vessel impairment 
investments we hold an investment in the capital stock of jinhui shipping and transportation limited jinhui 
jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the supramax segment of drybulk shipping 
this investment is designated as available for sale and is reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in shareholders equity as a component of aoci 
the company classifies the investment as a current or noncurrent asset based on the company s intent to hold the investment at each reporting date 
effective august   the company elected hedge accounting for forward currency contracts in place associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares and therefore the unrealized currency gain or loss associated with jinhui cost basis is reflected in the income statement as a component of other expense to offset the gain or los s associated with these forward currency contracts 
on october   the company elected to discontinue the purchase of forward currency contracts associated with jinhui by entering into an offsetting trade that closed the previously opened currency contract  thereby eliminating the hedge on jinhui 
the cost of securities when sold is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense 
additionally  the realized gain or loss on the forward currency contracts is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an investing activity and is reflected in the caption payments on forward currency contracts  net 
investments are reviewed quarterly to identify possible other than temporary impairment in accordance asc subtopic  investments debt and equity securities asc 
when evaluating the investments  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  the underlying net asset value of the issuer s assets and liabilities  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
should the decline in the value of any investment be deemed to be other than temporary  the investment basis would be written down to fair market value  and the write down would be recorded to earnings as a loss 
investments that are not expected to be sold within the next year are cl assified as noncurrent 
during the fourth quarter of  our investment in jinhui was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in its market value versus our cost basis 
we recorded a million impairment loss during which was reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement 
we will continue to evaluate the investment on a quarterly basis to determine the likelihood of any further significant adverse effects on the fair value and amount of any additional impairment 
in the event we determine that the jinhui investment is subject to any additional other than temporary impairment  the amount of the impairment would be reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement for the amount of the impairment 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments such as amounts due to due from charterers  accounts payable and long term debt approximate their individual carrying amounts as of december  and december  due to their short term maturity or the variable rate nature of the respective borrowings under the credit facilities 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount we would receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and creditworthiness of us for liabilities 
see note fair value of financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the fair values of long term debt  derivative instruments  notes and available for sale securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flow in relation to our borrowings 
we held ten interest rate swap agreements with dnb nor bank at december  and to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates

there were no swaps in an asset position at december  as of december  and  the company has accumulated other comprehensive deficit of million and million  respectively  related to the effectively hedged portion of the swaps 
hedge ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swaps resulted in other income expense of million and million for and  respectively 
at december   million of aoci is expected to be reclassified into income over the next months associated with interest rate derivatives 
we are subject to market risks relating to changes in libor rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding

prior to january   the margin was only 
we also paid libor plus on the outstanding debt under the million term loan facility and million term loan facility 
additionally  baltic trading paid libor plus on outstanding debt under the baltic trading credit facility up until november  when the amendment to the baltic trading credit facility decreased the applicable margin from to 
a increase in libor would result in an increase of million in interest expense for the year ended december   considering the increase would be only on the unhedged portion of the debt 
derivative financial instruments as of december   we held ten interest rate swap agreements that we entered into with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates

the interest rate differential pertaining to the interest rate swaps for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the company is currently utilizing cash flow hedge accounting for the swaps whereby the effective portion of the change in value of the swaps is reflected as a component of aoci 
the ineffective portion is recognized as other expense income  which is a component of other expense income 
if for any period of time we did not designate the swaps for hedge accounting  the change in the value of the swap agreements prior to designation would be recognized as other expense income 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of hedged interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period of interest rate exposure provided the designated liability continues to exist 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of unhedged interest rate swaps are reflected as other expense income and are listed as a component of other expense income
