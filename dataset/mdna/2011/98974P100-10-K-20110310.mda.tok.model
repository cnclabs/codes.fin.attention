overview we are a leader in providing secure  email encryption in a saas model 
our email encryption service delivers information in a secure manner  enabling the use of internet based email for the safe delivery of sensitive information  especially for the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors 
a core competency is our ability to deliver this complex service offering with a high level of availability  reliability  integrity and security 
the company is encouraged by results and our success is based on continuing to build a solid and predictable business based on our successful subscription business model 
additionally  our results indicate we are transitioning to become a part of mainstream demand for email encryption as data security and integrity issues 
table of contents continue to make headline news 
we are also benefiting from a trend toward the use of a powerful cloud based offering along with the growing need for regulatory compliance 
we achieved our first ever full year gaap net income in and we successfully wound down the e prescribing business as planned on december  all of our key performance metrics improved compared to the prior year and we reported improved financial performance driven by continued growth in our email encryption business and the successful exit from e prescribing 
the company s operating income for was million  an increase of million over prior year  driven by growth in revenue 
strategy and focus areas the company s email encryption subscription service continued to grow in by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
our subscription model initially required large up front investment to establish the service  but over time  the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription and transaction fees  and incremental costs to add new users are relatively low 
after the years required to achieve critical mass in the email encryption business with the subscription model  combined with the successful wind down of the e prescribing business  we believe we entered a new phase of financial stability in over the course of we continued to make investments to strengthen our email encryption services by completing development of and releasing a number of service upgrades 
we delivered zixgateway  an upgrade to our policy based appliance that provides support for virtualization  multiple languages and domainkeys identified mail dkim 
we also completed and released zixport  an upgrade to our portal based service which provides language localization  increased large file support and support for the iphone 
we updated our software platform for the desktop client portfolio to align with recent computing technology evolution and advancements and delivered new versions which are aligned to microsoft office in addition  we designed a set of tools to improve the automation level and efficiency of the customer provisioning process for our resellers and distributors 
this will allow our third party channels to deploy our service more quickly and at lower cost 
operationally  our success is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics new subscriptions termed new first year orders nfyo for the email encryption service  retention of subscribers to the email encryption service  total orders includes nfyo s  second and third years on multi year orders and renewals  and  our ability to increase business volume with minimal cost increases 
known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on our current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to achieve these key metrics 
our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services 
driven primarily by the growth of the email business combined with improved financial results associated with the wind down of the e prescribing business  we have improved fundamentals in our cash and achieved gaap profitability in see item a 
risk factors for more information on the risks relative to our operations and future prospects 
discontinued operations on december   zix corporation completed the previously announced see current report filed on form k a dated january  wind down of its e prescribing business and discontinued operating this line of business 
the wind down of this business entailed the fulfillment of existing contracts 
assets used by this segment  primarily business computer servers  were compatible with the remaining business  email encryption  and were therefore absorbed by our remaining business 
as a result  no gain or loss on disposal of assets was incurred 
prior to the completion of the wind down  this business line had been a reportable segment 
the following table summarizes the components of the income loss from discontinued operations presented in our statement of operations for  and 
table of contents year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses income loss before income taxes in december of  the company announced it would wind down the e prescribing business and exit the business by december  during we reduced the costs of operating this business and transferred shared resources to the remaining business while meeting the requirements of our existing contracts 
we also discontinued our recruiting efforts for new e prescribing deployments and reduced the associated recruitment and deployment expenses 
additionally  customers requesting to renew existing contracts set to expire during were renewed to terminate no later than december  these actions resulted in significantly lower costs and lower revenue in compared to and for the e prescribing business 
the income before income taxes of  resulted primarily from the continued recognition of deferred revenue during the year while reducing expenses in cost of revenues  research and development  and sg a 
unless specifically noted  the financial information contained and discussed in our md a is that of our continuing operations only 
revenue revenue increased by in compared with our growth was driven by our successful subscription model that continues to yield steady additions to the subscriber base coupled with a high rate of renewing existing customers 
operating margins for the year ended  our gross profit of million increased compared to this increase was primarily driven by increased revenue 
our operating income of million improved million over the prior year 
income from continuing operations for included a million reduction to the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reduction was recorded as a tax benefit in income from continuing operations for excluding the impact of this tax benefit was million compared to million in other financial highlights we completed our exit from the e prescribing business 
our statements of operations have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued e prescribing operation email encryption backlog was million in  compared with at the end of total orders for were million  an increase of from the total orders of million our deferred revenue at the end of was million  compared with million at the end of deferred revenue included million related to the discontinued e prescribing segment we generated cash flows from operations of million during fiscal our cash and cash equivalents were million at the end of  compared with million at the end of our shared  cloud based zixdirectory now has approximately million members including some of the most respected institutions in the country 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue  income loss from operations and net income loss  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about complex matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies included the following revenue recognition income taxes valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation costs for additional discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we develop  market  and support applications that connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner 
our services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption subscription based services  various transaction fees and related professional services 
the majority of the revenues generated are through a combination of direct sales and a network of resellers and other distribution partners 
under all product categories and distribution models  we recognize revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we are engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation  no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
our email encryption service is a subscription service 
providing this service includes delivering subscribed for software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
our email subscribers generally execute multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
subscription fees received from customers are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
we do not offer stand alone services 
further  our services primarily include manufacturer provided warranty provisions 
we recorded no warranty expense in any of the presented periods 

table of contents the discontinued e prescribing service was also a subscription service 
some of these services incorporated transaction fees per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels had been reached 
these transaction fees were recognized as revenue when the transaction occurred or when a predetermined usage level had been achieved  and when the amounts were fixed and determinable 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   we provided a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our accumulated us deferred tax assets of  this significant valuation allowance reflects our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance is valued at  and consists of  for net operation loss carryforwards and  for us state income tax credits and  for a canadian deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense 
if us taxable income increases from its current level in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company previously recorded a  tax contingency liability related to tax year  and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged except for currency translation adjustments 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the  tax liability and  in other uncertain positions in  was approximately  included in this balance are tax positions which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets after classifying intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with finite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
goodwill was  or of total assets at december   and was  or of total assets at december  our goodwill is not being amortized  but we do evaluate the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to  versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we have evaluated our goodwill and determined no impairment is required 
stock based compensation we have non qualified stock options outstanding to employees  directors  and third parties under various stock option plans 
the plans require the exercise price of options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the options  subject to termination of employment  generally expire ten years from the date of grant 
employee options generally vest pro rata and quarterly over three years 
option grants to employees  officers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in the applicable option agreements 
we currently 
table of contents use the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
for periods prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans 
our share based awards are limited to stock options

ending unrestricted cash was  on december  results of operations revenue the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our total revenues variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
revenues revenue increases were driven primarily by strong performances across our three core vertical sales markets healthcare  finance and government and other non core markets 
additionally  sales came from a wider base of distributors new first year orders derived from our value added resellers  oem and third party distribution channels for was of the total nfyo compared to in our growth model seeks to continually add new users to the subscriber base  while at the same time retaining a high percentage of existing subscribers whose subscriptions are up for renewal 
we measure additions to the subscriber base by nfyo  which is defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
nfyos are summarized in the table below year ended december  new first year order value our go to market selling strategy seeks primarily multiple year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
as a result  a high percentage of customers subscribe to the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
we expect this preference for a longer contract term by a high percentage of our customers to continue in  as we have priced our services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
our list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent during the periods shown above 
we have continued to experience some market pricing pressure resulting in additional discount percentages off our list price during this period 
there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on our new orders 

table of contents revenue outlook with our continued focus in email encryption on sectors such as healthcare  financial services  insurance  government  and expansion into other non core markets  along with the increased use of indirect oem distribution and value added reseller channels  we expect to see the business increase its new first year orders in and fuel a continued increase in our year over year revenue 
backlog and orders backlog our end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that we expect to amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog was comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid net  and approximately  of unbilled contracts 
the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
orders total order input for email encryption in was  compared with  in total orders include customer orders that management separates into three components for measurement purposes contract renewals  nfyos  and in the case of new multi year contracts  the years beyond the first year of service 
cost of revenues the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the cost of revenues 
variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
cost of revenues cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support and the amortization of company owned  customer based computer appliances 
for email encryption  a significant portion of the total cost of revenues relates to the zixdata center  which currently has excess capacity 
accordingly  cost of revenues is relatively fixed in nature and is expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue 
during  we transitioned a significant amount of shared resources from our e prescribing product line resulting from the wind down of that business 
additionally  we shifted fixed costs that were previously absorbed by e prescribing 
the cost of revenues increase in compared to resulting from this shifting of shared resource costs and allocated fixed costs was approximately  the remaining increase in cost of revenues in compared to  approximately  resulted from growth in revenue  primarily costs associated with deploying and supporting the email encryption service

research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our development staff  and other costs associated with improving our existing products and services and developing new products and services 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to resulted 
table of contents primarily from a  increase in salaries and benefits resulting from increases in average headcount and approximately  increase resulting primarily from the shift from the e prescribing business of shared resources and shift in allocated fixed costs 
during we wound down the e prescribing operation and shifted previously shared resources to the remaining business  email encryption 
additionally  we shifted fixed expenses previously absorbed by e prescribing to email encryption 
the increase in research and development expense in compared to was primarily attributable to a  increase in salary and benefit expense resulting from an increase in average headcount and salary increases  an  increase in stock based compensation expense  and an increase of  resulting primarily from directing a higher percentage of research and engineering resources to email encryption in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  travel  stock based compensation and benefits for marketing  selling and executive and administrative personnel 
also included are costs associated with advertising and promotions and fees for professional services and other general corporate activities 
the increase in compared to resulted primarily from higher marketing expenses  sales commissions and travel expenses due to growth in the business 
these increases were partially offset by lower severance and professional fees  both related to the wind down of the e prescribing business 
selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to increased  this increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefits  primarily related to severance costs of  increased professional fees of  of which approximately  related to a non recurring strategic review of the company s e prescribing business  and stock based compensation expense of  the remaining net increase   resulted from other net increases and decreases in the various selling  general and administrative expense categories 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for are expected to increase slightly compared to the levels due to continued investment in our sales and marketing resources 
interest expense interest expense for and was  and  respectively  consisting of interest related to a license subscription promissory note payable 
we incurred no interest expense in investment and other income investment and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreasing amounts in all years presented was primarily driven by lower interest rates 
income taxes our company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and in the canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including 
table of contents resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company s income tax benefit expense for  and of   and  respectively  represents refundable us research and development credits  us taxes payable related to the operations of the company s canadian subsidiary established in late  state income taxes  and reversal of a portion of the company s historical valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider available evidence  including past earnings  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company partially reserved its us net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
the portion of the company s deferred tax asset not reserved was  this unreserved portion related to  us net operating losses nols because we believe the company will generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these nols prior to their expiration 
the remaining  related to state tax credit carryforwards because such credits will be used to offset revenue based state franchise tax 
we have determined that utilization of existing net operating losses against future taxable income is not limited by section of the internal revenue code 
future ownership changes  however  may limit the company s ability to fully utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards against any future taxable income 
if we begin to generate additional us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our current estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing a greater or lesser amount of our deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance required 
adjusting our valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets will or will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement applicable to all income tax positions 
this includes the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income 
net income loss income from continuing operations in  the company s income from continuing operations was  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the amount included a tax benefit of  resulting from a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
income loss from discontinued operations in  income from discontinued operations was  compared to losses of  and  in and  respectively 
the income improvement in compared to and resulted primarily from recognizing remaining deferred revenue during the wind down when most of the costs associated with the discontinued e prescribing business had been eliminated or transferred to the remaining business  email encryption 
net income loss the company achieved its first ever annual net income of  in compared to net losses of  and  in and  respectively

we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and debt was prior to december   we operated two distinct business segments  email encryption and e prescribing 
during  we wound down the e prescribing business and exited the business on december  the remaining business  email encryption  is profitable and is expected to continue to grow 
for the year ended december   we improved on record performance in the prior year and achieved our best financial results to date 
a growth in revenue  gross margin and strong cash collections led to improved financial performance 
this improvement was primarily driven from increased revenues while holding our costs relatively flat 
we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future  and believe a significant portion of our spending is discretionary and flexible and that we have the ability to adjust overall cash spending to react  as needed  to any shortfalls in projected cash 
sources and uses of cash years ended december  net cash provided by operations net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities for and  our primary source of liquidity from operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers  accounts receivable from our customers  and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers

we did not continue this practice in and and do not expect to use this practice going forward 
related to our investing activities in  we utilized  to purchase various computing equipment primarily to satisfy customer contracts 
approximately of these capital purchases were for computer servers  which are required to deliver our services 
the cash provided from financing activities in was due to the exercise of stock options and warrants 
options and warrants of zixcorp common stock we have significant warrants and options outstanding that are currently vested
