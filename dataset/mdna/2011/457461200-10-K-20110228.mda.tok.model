in this report  all references to we  our and us refer collectively to inland real estate corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
executive summary we are a self managed  publicly traded real estate investment trust reit that owns and operates neighborhood  community  power and single tenant retail centers 
we are incorporated under maryland law 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with such development or construction 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
our development joint venture properties are not included as investment properties until they reach what we believe is a stabilized occupancy rate 
we engage in certain activities through inland venture corporation ivc and inland exchange venture corporation ievc  wholly owned trs entities 
these entities engage in activities that would otherwise not be permitted for a reit  such as managing properties owned by ventures in which we are a partner 
the trs entities are subject to federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities 
we have qualified and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended december  since we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders 
a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it distribute at least of its taxable income to stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  without the benefit of certain relief provisions  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income  property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 

table of contents income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources include  but are not limited to  amounts raised from the sale of securities  including shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan drp and our at the market atm issuance program  draws on our unsecured line of credit facility  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
during the year ended december   our leasing activity remained strong and our leasing spreads remained positive on renewed leases 
however  we experienced our second consecutive year of declining leasing spreads on new leases 
these declining leasing spreads on new leases contributed to the overall decrease in our revenues 
we will continue to attempt to renew expiring leases and re lease those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at more favorable rental rates to increase revenues and cash flow 
during the year ended december   we executed new  renewal and non comparable leases expansion square footage or spaces for which no former tenant was in place for one year or more  aggregating approximately  square feet on our consolidated portfolio 
the new leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a decrease over the average expiring rate 
the renewal leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
the non comparable leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average base rent of 
on a blended basis  the new and renewal leases executed during the year had an average rental rate of per square foot  an increase of over the average expiring rent 
during  leases will be expiring in our consolidated portfolio  which comprise approximately  square feet and account for approximately of our annualized base rent 
the weighted average expiring rate on these leases is per square foot 
occupancy at december  and for our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolio is summarized below consolidated occupancy as of december  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy unconsolidated occupancy as of december  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy total occupancy as of december  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy a leased occupancy is defined as the percentage of gross leasable area for which there is a signed lease  regardless of whether the tenant is currently obligated to pay rent under their lease agreement 
b financial occupancy is defined as the percentage of total gross leasable area for which a tenant is obligated to pay rent under the terms of its lease agreement  regardless of the actual use or occupation by that tenant of the area being leased 
we seek to acquire properties with high quality tenants and attempt to mitigate our risk of tenant defaults by maintaining a diversified tenant base 
for example  no single tenant accounted for more than approximately of annual base rent in our total portfolio as of december  economic conditions affect the real estate industry in varying degrees 
adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could result in the inability of certain tenants to fulfill their lease obligations and could also affect our ability to attract new tenants 
our investment properties are typically anchored by grocery  drug or discount stores  providing everyday goods and services to consumers  rather than those stores which sell discretional items 

table of contents we believe consumer spending habits have shifted and consumers are focused on necessities and are demanding greater value for these items 
the impact of the economic conditions has caused many consumers to spend significantly less on discretionary items 
those retailers specializing in necessity based items are the retailers we believe are improving 
due to our focus on necessity based retailers  we believe the declines in our revenues and occupancy would have been greater if we focused on other types of properties 
during this time of decline for us and our competitors  we have maintained occupancy levels higher than the averages published in our focus areas of chicago and minneapolis 
the economic downturn is still having an impact on many retailers in our portfolio and we have been negatively impacted by bankruptcy filing by both national retail chains and smaller tenant bankruptcy filings 
although showing signs of improvement  the operating environment for retailers remains challenging 
we believe there may be additional tenant failures during although retail sales have increased slightly  we believe it will take some time for sales to be restored to pre recession levels 
the timeline for filling the vacancies created by tenant failures and bankruptcies is longer because the supply of available space has increased and tenant demand has decreased 
we have been able to re lease much of the space vacated by big box tenants and are negotiating leases to fill more of these vacancies during although certain leases were signed at rental rates higher than the vacating tenant  most of the leases were signed at rates significantly below the previous rate 
the effect of signing these leases at rates lower than the previous lease rates has resulted in a loss of rental income 
the longer lengths of time that spaces have been vacant  the payment of operating expenses without tenant reimbursements and the reality of re leasing at rates lower than the previous leases have a negative impact on our financial results 
additionally  there are costs associated with leasing vacant spaces such as leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  which both have the affect of reducing our cash flow at the beginning of the new lease 
our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable and other debt obligations 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to the lease agreements  most tenants of the property are required to reimburse us for some or all of the particular tenant s pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
to measure our operating results against those of other retail real estate owners operators  we compare occupancy percentages and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results against those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in net income and ffo  growth in same store income and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and total assets 
strategies and objectives current strategies our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our success in operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  management  leasing and development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  of our properties 
during  our focus was on continuing to strengthen our balance sheet 
in november  we entered into a sales agency agreement with bmo capital markets to offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time 
during the year ended december  we sold approximately  shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately  the proceeds were used for growth opportunities  including acquisitions for our joint venture with ipcc 

table of contents we successfully addressed approximately  of debt maturities on our consolidated portfolio 
this included the extension of both our unsecured term loan  which was scheduled to mature in and our unsecured line of credit facility  which was scheduled to mature in additionally  through our convertible note tender and exchange offer  we addressed  of notes that otherwise could have been put to us in november in conjunction with the tender and exchange offer   of notes were paid off and  were exchanged for new notes with an initial put date of november approximately  of consolidated secured debt  with a weighted average interest rate of  matures during we will soon be in discussions with the lenders of our secured debt and will negotiate to refinance the secured debt maturing in if our attempts to refinance are successful  we anticipate that the average rates on the new borrowings could be approximately to basis points above the average expiring rates 
additionally   in face value of convertible notes can be put to us in november we anticipate being able to meet our obligations under the indenture governing the notes using funds from one or more possible sources available to us  including but not limited to  issuing new notes  draws on our unsecured line of credit  proceeds from financing unencumbered properties and proceeds from the sale of shares under our atm issuance program 
acquisition strategies we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers that meet our investment criteria 
we will  from time to time  acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers requiring financing or financing contingencies 
additionally  we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we have been successful in leasing additional space to some existing tenants in our current investment properties 
joint ventures we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be redeveloped and vacant land to be developed 
we structure these ventures to earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  asset management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those investment properties under management  however acquisition fees may decrease as we acquire fewer investment properties through these ventures 
additionally  we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties that are ultimately sold through an offering of tenant in common tic interests or delaware statutory trusts dst in properties to investors 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those properties under management  even after all of the tic or dst interests have been sold 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities to provide operating efficiencies 
we seek to improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities

acres sales price savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il north aurora outlots phase i north american real estate north aurora il savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il critical accounting policies general 
a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and allocation of investment properties  determining whether assets are held for sale  recognition of rental income and lease termination income  our cost capitalization and depreciation policies and consolidation equity accounting policies 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
impairment of investment properties 
we assess the carrying values of our investment properties  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these investment properties may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of the investment properties is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the investment property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
in order to review our investment properties for recoverability  we consider current market conditions  as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party appraisals  where considered necessary 
if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the investment property is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows based on management s intent as follows i for real estate properties that we intend to hold long term  including land held for development  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on the estimated future net rental income from operating the property  ii for real estate properties that we intend to sell  including land parcels  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on estimated proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates  and iii for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition or development of a real estate property  recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur as of the measurement date 
the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business 
however assumptions and estimates about future cash flows  discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective 
changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our real estate properties 

table of contents impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities 
we also review our investments in unconsolidated entities 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investments from future expected cash flows 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value  the determination of when a loss is other than temporary  and the calculation of the amount of the loss  is complex and subjective 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of its equity investments 
allocation of investment properties 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
purchase price allocations are based on our estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
in some circumstances we engage independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocation 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties 
we expense acquisition costs for investment property acquisitions to record the acquisition at its fair value 
prior to january   we capitalized all acquisition costs as part of the value of the investment property as an addition to building and improvements 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the values of the acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the life of each respective lease as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the life of the related leases for each property as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 

table of contents the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies 
we review all expenditures and capitalize any item that is deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement 
if we capitalize more items  current depreciation expense would be higher  however  total current expenses would be lower 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of each asset category 
assets held for sale 
in determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale  we consider whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  ii the asset is available for immediate sale  in its present condition  iii we have initiated a program to locate a buyer  iv we believe that the sale of the asset is probable  v we have received a significant non refundable deposit for the purchase of the property  vi we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value  and vii actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan 
if all of the above criteria are met  we classify the asset as held for sale 
on the day that these criteria are met  we suspend depreciation on the assets held for sale  including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions  as well as on the amortization of acquired in place leases and customer relationship values 
the assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period 
additionally  the operations for the periods presented are classified on the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectability of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we have reason to believe will be uncollectable  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
amounts deemed to be uncollectable are written off 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculated by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
recognition of lease termination income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
upon early lease termination  we provide for losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets 

table of contents consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has a controlling financial interest in the vie  which is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities that  when taken together  most significantly impact the vie s performance  and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the vie that would be significant to the vie 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate an entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a vie are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a vie we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations but instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment in securities 
we classify our investment in securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
investment in securities at december  and consist of perpetual preferred securities and common securities classified as available for sale securities  which are recorded at fair value and preferred securities not classified as available for sale securities and therefore  recorded at cost 
we determined that these securities should be held at cost because the fair value is not readily determinable and there is no active market for these securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
for an impaired security we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and consider whether the evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
in addition  under the debt security model  an evaluation as to the underlying credit of the issuer is made 
however  without recovery in the near term such that liquidity returns to the markets and spreads return to levels that reflect underlying credit characteristics  additional other than temporary losses may occur in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during  and 
table of contents we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions could periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverage 
however  we do not believe the risk is significant based on our review of the rating of the institutions where our cash is deposited 
in  fdic insurance coverage was increased to  per depositor at each insured bank 
this increase will be in place until december   at which time it will return to  per depositor  unless coverage is further extended income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities  including shares of our common stock sold under our drp and ongoing atm issuance program  our draws on our unsecured line of credit facility  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties  earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders and fee income received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants on our unsecured credit facilities 
we had up to  available under our  line of credit facility and an additional  available under an accordion feature 
the access to the accordion feature requires approval of the lending group 
if approved  the terms for the funds borrowed under the accordion feature would be current market terms and not the terms of the existing line of credit facility 
the lending group is not obligated to approve access to the additional funds 
if necessary  such as for new acquisitions  we believe we can generate capital by entering into financing arrangements or joint venture agreements with institutional investors 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating and interest expenses at our investment properties  for purchasing additional investment properties  joint venture commitments  to repay draws on the line of credit facility and for retiring mortgages payable 
on november   we entered into a sales agency agreement with bmo capital markets corp 
bmo to offer and sell up to million of our common stock from time to time through bmo  acting as sales agent 
offers and sales of shares of our common stock may be made in privately negotiated transactions if we and bmo have so agreed in writing or by any other method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act  including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange or to or through a market maker 
we have referred to the arrangement with bmo in this report on form k as our atm issuance program 
as of december   we issued approximately  shares of our common stock pursuant to the atm issuance program 
we received net proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of these shares and used the proceeds for growth opportunities  including acquisitions for our joint venture with ipcc 
as a means of conserving capital in recent years  we deferred making certain capital expenditures  such as roof and parking lot replacements 
additionally  as a result of the significant leasing activity we have experienced during the last half of  we anticipate significant expenditures related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we anticipate that the costs of these capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions will be more than  higher than the average expended in previous years 
we expect to fund these improvements using cash from operations and draws on our unsecured line of credit facility 
we do not expect this trend to carry forward into future years 
we expect to complete the aforementioned deferred capital projects and the work related to our new leases in although we expect to fund these types of projects in the future  we expect the amount of spending on these items will return to levels comparable to years prior to certain joint venture commitments require us to invest cash in properties under development 
in certain cases  this capital is invested for periods longer than expected 
we have delayed completion of our development projects from our original and completion dates for one to two years due to challenging conditions 
therefore  our investment of  in our development projects will be committed longer than originally anticipated 
we have guaranteed approximately  of current unconsolidated joint venture debt 
these guarantees are in effect for the entire term of each respective loan as set forth in the loan documents 
there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the funds invested in these ventures or that we will earn a return on these invested funds 

table of contents we invest in marketable securities of other entities  including reits 
these investments in available for sale securities totaled  at december   consisting of preferred and common stock investments 
at december   we had recorded a net unrealized gain of  on these investment securities 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are specifically identified and determined 
during the years ended december  and  we realized gains on sale of  and  respectively 
additionally  during the year ended december   we realized a non cash impairment loss of  related to a decline in value of certain investment securities which were determined to be other than temporary 
no such losses were required or recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
in the aggregate  our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  monthly debt service requirements and current distributions 
monthly debt service requirements are primarily interest only as only certain of our secured mortgages require monthly principal amortization 
the following table presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  based on debt outstanding at december  a thereafter total maturing debt fixed rate debt c variable rate debt b weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt variable rate debt a included in the debt maturing during are our unsecured credit facilities  totaling  we pay interest only during the term of these facilities at a variable rate equal to either basis points over libor  with a floor of basis points  or basis points over the alternate base rate  in effect at the time of the borrowing 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding draws on the line of credit facility was  and the interest rate on the term loan was 
these credit facilities require compliance with certain covenants  such as debt service ratios  minimum net worth requirements  distribution limitations and investment restrictions

when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investments from future expected cash flows 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the total impairment loss is recorded at the joint venture level

this loss is included in provision for asset impairment on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
no impairment charges related to the basis differences were required or recorded during the years ended december  and additionally  during the year ended december   we determined that  based on the fair value of the related properties  portions of our investments in certain properties were unrecoverable and that the entire investment in pdg inland tuscany village venture llc and tdc inland lakemoor llc were not recoverable 
therefore  the following impairment losses were recorded to reflect the investments at fair value and are included in provision for asset impairment for the year ended december  on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income

our development partners have historically identified opportunities  assembled and completed the entitlement process for the land  and gauged national big box retailer interest in the location before bringing the project to us for consideration 
we typically contribute financing  leasing  and property management expertise to enhance the productivity of the new developments and are typically entitled to earn a preferred return on our portion of invested capital 
within the prevailing economic environment  a number of retailers have delayed new store openings until market conditions substantially improve 
in light of this marketplace reality  we have extended delivery dates for these projects up to two years 
to provide clarity as to the current status of our development projects  we have divided them into two categories  active projects and land held for future development 
the projects considered active projects are savannah crossing in aurora  illinois  north aurora phase i in north aurora  illinois  orchard crossing in fort wayne  indiana  and southshore shopping center in boise  idaho 
construction is essentially complete at savannah crossing and orchard crossing and southshore shopping center is a redevelopment of an existing building

these include north aurora phase ii and iii in north aurora  illinois  shops at lakemoor in lakemoor  illinois  lantern commons in westfield  indiana  and tuscany village in paradise  florida 
we will deploy capital for construction or improvements to development properties only when we have signed commitments from retailers 
fair value disclosures in some instances  certain of our assets and liabilities are required to be measured or disclosed at fair value according to a fair value hierarchy pursuant to relevant accounting literature 
this hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair values  which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable 
level model derived valuations with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their classifications within the fair value hierarchy levels 
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  quantitative disclosure of the fair value for each major category of assets and liabilities is presented below fair value measurements at december  using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level description available for sale securities investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures nare inland north aurora i nare inland north aurora ii nare inland north aurora iii total assets derivative interest rate instruments liabilities variable rate debt fixed rate debt total liabilities the fair value of debt is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
we estimate the fair value of our total debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income available to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income loss available to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties gain from change in control of investment properties equity in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of noncontrolling interest funds from operations net income loss available to common stockholders per weighted average common share basic and diluted funds from operations  per weighted average common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted distributions declared distributions per common share items impacting ffo gain on extinguishment of debt provision for asset impairment impairment of investment securities provision for asset impairment included in equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures tax benefit expense related to current impairment charges  net of valuation allowance 
table of contents ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains loss on non operating property 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we believe ebitda is an important supplemental non gaap measure 
we utilize ebitda to calculate our interest expense coverage ratio  which equals ebitda divided by total interest expense 
we believe that using ebitda  which excludes the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  all of which are based on historical cost and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  facilitates comparison of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  particularly in light of the use of ebitda by a seemingly large number of reits in their reports on forms q and k 
we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required us gaap measures of our performance to improve their understanding of our operating results

table of contents impact of recent accounting principles guidance issued in june  improves the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financials statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financials position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
the guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter and needs to be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 
guidance issued in june  amends previously issued guidance related to consolidation 
these changes eliminate certain scope exceptions previously permitted  provide additional guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and require companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidated variable interest entities 
the changes also replace the previously required quantitative approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity with a requirement for an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
changes are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as there are no changes to which entities are consolidated 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
subsequent events on january   our joint venture with pggm purchased joffco square from an unaffiliated third party for approximately  the property is located in chicago  illinois and contains  square feet of leasable area 
on january   we paid a cash distribution of per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  on january   we announced that we had declared a cash distribution of per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock 
this distribution was payable on february  to the stockholders of record at the close of business on january  on february   we took control of orchard crossings  in fort wayne  indiana  a property previously held through our joint venture with pine tree 
prior to the change in control  we accounted for our investment in this property as an unconsolidated entity 
on february   we sold schaumburg golf road retail  in schaumburg  il to an unaffiliated third party for  on february   we paid a cash distribution of per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on january  on february   we announced that we had declared a cash distribution of per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock 
this distribution is payable on march  to the stockholders of record at the close of business on february  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument is designed to reduce that exposure 
gains or losses related to the derivative financial instrument would be deferred and amortized over the terms of the hedged instrument 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
during the year ended december  we entered into an interest rate swap contract  as a requirement under a new  secured mortgage 
during the years ended december  and we had no material derivative instruments  on a consolidated basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
these variable rate loans are based on libor  therefore  fluctuations in libor will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting this debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans which are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing or extension based on our view of the current interest rate environment 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
the instruments  the principal amounts of which are presented below  were entered into for non trading purposes 
a b c d thereafter total fair value e fixed rate debt g weighted average interest rate variable rate debt f weighted average interest rate a approximately  of our mortgages payable mature during we will soon be in discussions with the lenders of our secured debt and will negotiate to refinance the secured debt maturing in if our attempts to refinance are successful  we anticipate that the average rates on the new borrowings could be approximately to basis points above the average expiring rates 
finalizing these new borrowings is subject to  among other things  the lenders completing their respective due diligence and negotiating and executing definitive agreements 
there is no assurance we will be able to complete these borrowings 
b included in the debt maturing in is our convertible notes issued during  which mature in they are included in because that is the earliest date these notes can be redeemed or the note holder can require us to repurchase their note 
the total for convertible notes above reflects the total principal amount outstanding  in the amount of  the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of a fair value adjustment of  c included in the debt maturing during are our unsecured credit facilities  totaling  we pay interest only during the term of these facilities at a variable rate equal to either basis points over libor  with a floor of basis points  or basis points over the alternate base rate  in effect at the time of the borrowing 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding draws on the line of credit facility was  and the interest rate on the term loan was 
these credit facilities require compliance with certain covenants  such as debt service ratios  minimum net worth requirements  distribution limitations and investment restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
d included in the debt maturing in is our convertible notes issued during  which mature in they are included in because that is the earliest date these notes can be redeemed or the note holder can require us to repurchase their note 
the total for convertible notes above reflects the total principal amount outstanding  in the amount of  the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of a fair value adjustment of  
table of contents e the fair value of debt is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
we estimate the fair value of our debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 
f we have guaranteed a mortgage for  and we would be required to make a payment on this guarantee upon the default of any of the provisions in the loan document  unless the default is otherwise waived 
g we have guaranteed a mortgage for  and we would be required to make a payment on this guarantee upon the default of any of the provisions in the loan document  unless the default is otherwise waived 
the table above does not reflect indebtedness incurred after december  our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness  fixed rate debt that matures and needs to be refinanced and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
at december   approximately  or  of our debt has variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on debt containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately for the year ended december  equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
our exposure to changes in equity prices is a result of our investment in securities 
at december   our investment in securities  classified as available for sale  totaled  the carrying values of investments in securities subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  therefore  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from any number of factors including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
additionally  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
we do not engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our equity price risk 
other than temporary impairments on our investment in securities were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no such impairments were required or recorded for the year ended december  we believe that our investments will continue to generate dividend income and  as the stock market recovers  we have begun to recognize gains on sale
