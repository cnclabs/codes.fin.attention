item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview highlights both of the company s business segments continued to be impacted during by the states of the end markets served by the company 
in the logistics and manufacturing services segment  the end markets of the distribution businesses  particularly in north america  showed improvements while the aerospace aftermarket business reflected slight decreases in demand due to a continued trend of deferred maintenance 
at precision components  the industrial manufacturing businesses were favorably impacted by increased production in the transportation and industrial end markets while demand in the aerospace original equipment manufacturing business was lower than as a result  sales increased in both business segments and were up to  million company wide 
during  operating income was positively impacted by the higher sales volumes  lower cost structures which resulted from actions taken prior to to restructure the company s operations  and the absence of restructuring charges 
operating income increased from million in to million in management continued its focus on cash flow and working capital management in and generated million in cash flow from operations 
the company made higher investments in working capital in  primarily a result of improving business conditions and higher customer demand 
management objectives management is focused on three areas of development employees  processes and strategy which  in combination  are expected to generate long term value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products  services  markets and customers  and growth from acquisitions 
the company s strategies for profitability include lean  productivity and process initiatives  such as production realignment  and efficiency and cost saving measures as well as portfolio management 
acquisitions and strategic relationships have been a key growth driver for the company in both of its business segments 
the company has acquired a number of businesses in the past  the most recent of which was in the company continues to evaluate its portfolio management to optimize product line offerings and expand geographic reach  and provide synergistic opportunities 
the company also continues to seek business alliances which foster long term business relationships 
our business barnes group consists of two operating segments logistics and manufacturing services  and precision components 
in both of these businesses  barnes group is among the leaders in the market niches served  and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures 
the logistics and manufacturing services segment provides value added logistical support and repair services 
value added logistical support services include inventory management  technical sales  and supply chain solutions for maintenance  repair  operating  and production supplies and services 
repair services provided include the manufacturing of spare parts for the refurbishment and repair of highly engineered components and assemblies for commercial and military aviation

precision components also manufactures high precision punched and fine blanked components used in transportation and industrial applications  nitrogen gas springs and manifold systems used to precisely control stamping presses  and retention rings that position parts on a shaft or other axis 
key performance indicators management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses  as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
management also uses an internal measurement tool called ppat  or performance profit after tax 
ppat is an economic value added eva like metric that calculates operating profit after tax  less a charge for the capital employed by the business 
management utilizes ppat in economic decision making  such as capital expenditures  investments in growth initiatives  customer pricing decisions  and evaluation of acquisitions 
the goal of utilizing ppat is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation 
in addition to ppat  which is a measurement tool common in each operating unit  both segments have standard key performance indicators kpis  a number of which are focused on customer metrics customer satisfaction score  on time delivery and quality  internal effectiveness and efficiency metrics sales per employee  scrap and rework  days working capital and controllable expenses  employee related metrics total recordable incident rate and lost time incident rate  and unique kpis on organic growth 
key industry data in each segment  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at logistics and manufacturing services  the distribution business reviews data supplied by the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in canada and for the european based businesses 
management of the aftermarket aerospace operations monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet  the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service  aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines  engine shop visits  and traffic growth 
at precision components  key data for the industrial manufacturing operations include the ipi  the production of light vehicles  both in the us and globally  tooling build schedules  durable goods orders  compressor build forecasts  and global industrial capital expenditures 
the aerospace oem business regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers  as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft 
management also monitors annual appropriations for the us military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance

table of contents income taxes vs 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate from was primarily driven by the shift in the mix of income to higher taxing jurisdictions and the impact of the repatriation of a portion of current year foreign earnings to the us during  the company repatriated a dividend from a portion of current year foreign earnings to the us in the amount of million 
this dividend increased tax expense by million and increased the annual effective tax rate by percentage points 
vs 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared with in the decrease in the effective tax rate from was due primarily to the higher concentration of profits in lower taxing jurisdictions and the absence of profitability in higher tax jurisdictions 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to the consolidated effective income tax rate 
among other items which could impact the future tax rate is the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions where the company operates and the repatriation of a portion of future foreign earnings to the us in connection with an internal revenue service irs audit for the tax years through  the irs proposed adjustments to these tax years of approximately million  plus a potential penalty of of the tax assessment plus interest 
the adjustment relates to the federal taxation of foreign income of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company filed an administrative protest of these adjustments 
in the third quarter of  the company was informed that its protest was denied and a tax assessment was received from the appeals office of the irs 
in november  the company filed a petition against the irs in the us tax court contesting the tax assessment received 
the company continues to believe its tax position on the issues raised by the irs is correct and the company plans to continue to take appropriate actions to vigorously defend its position 
the company believes it will prevail on this issue 
any additional impact on the company s liability for income taxes cannot presently be determined  but the company continues to believe it is adequately provided for and the outcome will not have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  the company exited certain non core businesses within its logistics and manufacturing services segment in the united kingdom 
these exit activities included the sale of certain assets and transfer of related employees  liquidation of assets  termination of related contracts  and severing of employees 
the results of these businesses have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations 
in  the million loss included a million loss related to the exit activities 
of this amount approximately million reflected the loss on the sales  approximately million were employee related costs  including severance and other termination benefits  and approximately million related to other costs including contract termination charges 
in addition  a tax expense of approximately million included in discontinued operations related to the valuation and write off of certain deferred tax assets 
the losses are reported net of tax

the increases were directly attributable to the increase in net income 
basic weighted average shares outstanding in increased slightly primarily as a result of shares issued for employee stock plans and  shares of treasury stock used to repurchase certain of the company s convertible notes in august offset in part by the repurchase of  shares under the company s publicly announced repurchase program during diluted weighted average shares outstanding in increased as a result of the increase in basic weighted average shares outstanding and the increase in the dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares under the employee stock plans which was driven by an increase in the company s stock price 
the higher dilutive effect in was primarily the result of the company s higher stock price which impacted the potentially issuable shares under the employee stock plans and the convertible notes 
financial performance by business segment logistics and manufacturing services in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin vs 
logistics and manufacturing services recorded sales of million in  a increase from the increase was primarily a result of organic sales growth of million which resulted largely from end market improvements in the distribution businesses most significantly in north america 
sales in the aerospace aftermarket business decreased from and continued to be impacted by lower aircraft utilization and the deferred maintenance trend 
foreign currency translation had a negative impact on sales in of approximately million as the us dollar strengthened against foreign currencies  primarily in europe  as compared to 
table of contents operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services decreased to million from primarily as a result of the profit impact from lower sales from the higher margin aerospace aftermarket business  continued investments to benefit sales force productivity in the distribution businesses  and higher product and employee related costs 
operating profit was favorably impacted by the profit impact of the sales volume increase in the north american distribution businesses as the industrial and transportation end markets showed improvements from outlook organic sales levels in the distribution businesses of the logistics and manufacturing services segment are largely dependent upon the economy in the regions served  the retention of its customers and continuation of existing sales volumes to such customers  and the effectiveness and size of its sales force 
near term economic conditions remain uncertain and customers continue to manage costs and inventory levels 
management believes future sales growth may result from improvements in economic and end market conditions  pricing initiatives and investments in market penetration activities and sales force productivity initiatives 
near term sales levels in the aerospace aftermarket business are expected to continue reflecting recent trends towards improving maintenance  repair and overhaul activity 
management further believes its aerospace aftermarket business is favorably positioned based on strong customer relationships including long term maintenance and repair contracts in the overhaul and repair business  expected improvement in demand in the aftermarket spare parts business  expanded capabilities and current capacity levels 
operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services is expected to continue to be affected by the profit impact of the changes in sales volume and mix  and investments made in each of its businesses 
management is committed to actively manage pricing pressures from vendors through cost sharing initiatives with its customers and increased selling prices 
the highly profitable aftermarket rsps will continue to be impacted by the management fees payable to the customer which generally increase in the fourth or later years of each program 
these and other similar fees are deducted from sales and temper sales growth of the aftermarket rsps and operating margin 
vs 
the logistics and manufacturing services business segment reported sales of million in  a decrease from the lower sales were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales in all businesses of million 
lower organic sales in resulted primarily from softness in the distribution business primarily in north america due to weakness in the transportation related and industrial markets and  to a lesser extent  a reduced distribution sales force compared to in addition  sales declines in the aerospace aftermarket were driven by lower aircraft utilization  deferred maintenance activities and an increase in the rsp management fees 
the negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by approximately million in as the us dollar strengthened against foreign currencies  primarily in europe and canada  as compared to operating profit at logistics and manufacturing services in decreased from to million 
the decline in operating profit was driven by the profit impact of the lower sales volumes in each of its businesses due to the impact of economic conditions on the end markets served 
partially offsetting these declines was the positive impact of operational and productivity initiatives  including the lower operating costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in to address the deteriorating market conditions and geographical complexities  and to align the segment s cost structure with its declining sales 
precision components in millions change change sales operating profit nm operating margin nm not meaningful 
table of contents vs 
sales at precision components were million in  an increase of from the sales increase resulted primarily from organic sales increases of million which resulted mainly from increases in the industrial manufacturing businesses based in north america and europe and from improvements in the transportation industry  including automotive 
sales in the aerospace oem business were relatively flat in compared to the impact of foreign currency translation increased sales by approximately million in operating profit in at precision components was million compared to million in operating profit improvements in were due primarily to the profit impact of higher sales levels in  lower cost structures resulting from previous actions and lean initiatives 
however  these improvements in operating profit were partly offset by costs resulting from higher demand and new product introductions across the businesses including additional costs related to personnel  such as incentive compensation and temporary labor 
additionally  the results included approximately million in restructuring charges primarily for employee termination costs and asset write downs associated with moving the operations of two facilities 
outlook in the industrial manufacturing businesses  management is focused on generating organic sales growth by leveraging the benefits of the diversified products and industrial end markets in which its businesses have a global presence as well as gaining market share and introducing new products 
sales growth in the global markets served by these businesses is expected to remain uncertain due to economic conditions 
however  increased order activity in certain end markets  including transportation  along with investments made in these businesses during the down cycle may provide incremental benefits in the near term 
sales in the aerospace oem business are driven by its commercial engine order backlog through its participation in certain strategic engine programs 
backlog in this business was million at december   of which approximately is expected to be shipped in the next months 
in the near term  the aerospace oem business may be impacted by adjustments of customer inventory levels including insourcing trends  changes in production schedules of specific engine programs  and the general state of the aerospace market driven by the worldwide economy 
management believes that strong long term aerospace industry fundamentals remain which  together with the pursuit of new programs and increased content levels on certain platforms  are expected to drive future sales growth in this business 
operating profit is largely dependant on the sales volumes and mix within all businesses of the segment 
management continues to focus on improving profitability through organic sales growth  pricing initiatives  and productivity and process improvements such as lean 
costs associated with personnel  new product introductions and commodity price increases may negatively impact operating profit 
vs 
sales at precision components in were million  a decrease from the lower sales levels were primarily the result of weak global economic conditions and included a reduction in organic sales of million 
the industrial manufacturing businesses in north america and europe reported significant sales declines due to the global recession and its impact on the transportation industry and  in particular  the automotive sector 
additionally  sales decreased in the aerospace oem business as customers reduced inventory and lowered production levels 
the negative impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by million in as compared to spectrum plastics recorded sales of million in  thus the sale of this business in resulted in a reduction in sales of this amount in operating profit in at precision components was million  a decrease of from the decline in operating profits was driven by the impact of the lower sales volumes 
operating profit in was positively impacted by lower costs resulting from the discrete actions taken in late to address deteriorating 
table of contents market conditions including personnel reductions and plant consolidations  and initiatives focused on cost savings and cost containment 
the favorable impact of these initiatives  however  only partially offset the profit impact of the substantially lower sales levels in and approximately million of costs for actions taken throughout to address the continued deterioration in the market  including employee termination costs  asset write downs associated with consolidating certain facilities  and transfer of work costs 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
during  management continued to focus on cash flows and working capital management  and anticipates that operating activities in will continue to generate adequate cash

the funded status of the pension plans improved in primarily as a result of the increase in the fair value of the company s pension plan assets due mainly to the gains in the global equity markets 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in the projected benefit obligations of the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company recorded a million non cash after tax decrease in stockholders equity through other non owner changes to equity to record the current year adjustment for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under the accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
approximately million in contributions were made by the company to its various pension plans in which included the required minimum contributions to its qualified us pension plans

the credit markets have presented companies with significant challenges in maintaining or expanding credit facilities 
the company has assessed its credit facilities and currently expects that its bank syndicate  comprised of banks  will continue to support the million credit facility which matures in september at december   the company has million of unused and available borrowings under its million credit facility  subject to covenants in the company s debt agreements 
the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 

table of contents the company closely monitors compliance with its various debt covenants 
the company s most restrictive financial covenant the debt ratio requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to adjusted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement adjusted ebitda of not more than times at december  the actual ratio at december  was times

additionally  we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
cash flow in millions change change operating activities investing activities financing activities exchange rate effect nm increase decrease in cash nm not meaningful operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating million in cash during compared to million in compared to  the lower operating cash flows in were primarily driven by higher investments in working capital in  specifically in inventory and accounts receivable compared to the significant reductions in investments in inventory were necessitated by higher anticipated customer demand while the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from higher sales levels 
partially offsetting these reductions in operating cash flow  the company used less cash for long term retirement benefits in as compared to  which included an incremental cash contribution of million to its qualified pension plans to increase their funded status

cash used in financing activities in included a net increase in borrowings of million compared to a net decrease of million in the cash generated from operations in was used primarily for capital expenditures  dividends and common stock repurchases 
the activity reflects the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the wells fargo credit agreement and the notes primarily with borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the change in borrowings included the repurchase of million par value of convertible notes at a discounted price of million which was funded primarily with borrowings under revolving credit lines 
additionally  in the higher cash generated from operations and the cash on hand were used for capital expenditures and dividends as well as debt reduction 
total cash used to pay dividends 
table of contents decreased in by million to million due to a decrease in the cash dividends per common share from in to in under the terms of its publicly announced repurchase program  the company repurchased million shares of the company s stock at a cost of million in and million shares at a cost of million in the company may from time to time decide to repurchase additional shares under this program 
there are a maximum of million shares that may be repurchased under the existing program at december  at december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  the majority of which are held outside the us during  the company repatriated million of current year foreign earnings to the us the balances remain outside the us primarily to fund future international investments 
the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
at december   million was borrowed at an average interest rate of under the company s million borrowing facility which matures in september  the company did not have any borrowings under short term bank credit lines at december  at december   the company s total borrowings are comprised of approximately fixed rate debt and approximately variable rate debt 
the interest payments on approximately of the variable rate interest debt have been converted into payment of fixed interest plus the borrowing spread under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
debt covenants borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the company s debt agreements

the amounts reflect anticipated future benefit payments under the company s various other postretirement benefit plans based on current actuarial assumptions 
expected benefit payments do not extend beyond see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of the potential payments of these amounts cannot be determined 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 

table of contents business acquisitions and goodwill assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 
management completes their annual impairment assessment during the second quarter of each year 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the company has determined that its reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information reviewed by segment management one level below the operating segment level and which are aggregated when those components have similar economic characteristics 
management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using the income approach  which reflects management s cash flow projections  and also evaluates the fair value using a market approach 
these methodologies used in the current year are consistent with those used in the prior year 
management believes the cash flow projections utilized and or market multiples are reasonable and consistent with the expectations of market participants 
inherent in management s development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates  including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both company specific and overall economic conditions 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  management performed its annual impairment testing based on the information available as of the date of the assessment 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in and the fair values of each of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
however  the company s estimated fair value of its barnes distribution reporting unit  which is part of the logistics and manufacturing services segment and has approximately million of goodwill  decreased considerably from while the estimated fair value is substantially in excess of its carrying value  further declines may occur depending on its future cash flows that are significantly impacted by the economy in the regions served  the retention of its customers  the cost and inventory level management initiatives of its customers  continuation of existing sales volume and effectiveness and size of its sale force 
while management expects future operating improvements to result from improving end market conditions  further market penetration  sales force productivity initiatives and the expected benefits of prior restructuring actions there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met or that the fair value of the reporting unit will continue to exceed its carrying value 
if its fair value were to fall below its carrying value  a non cash impairment charge to income from operations could result 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company has paid participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to years 
the company records amortization of the related long lived intangible asset as sales dollars are being earned based on a proportional sales dollar method 
specifically  this method amortizes each intangible asset as a reduction to revenue based on the proportion of sales under a program in a given period to the estimated aggregate sales dollars over the life of that program 
this method reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are realized 
the recoverability of each intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
the company evaluates these intangible assets for impairment and updates amortization rates on an agreement by agreement basis 
the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment 
table of contents whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
annually  the company evaluates the remaining useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
management updates revenue projections  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate a triggering event requiring an impairment test of the intangible asset or require the company to accelerate amortization expense prospectively dependant on the level of the shortfall 
the company has not identified any impairment of these intangible assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reorganization of businesses the company records the cost of reorganization initiatives at the time the liability is incurred
