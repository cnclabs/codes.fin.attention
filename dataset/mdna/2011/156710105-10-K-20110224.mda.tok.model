prior to october  we reported our operations through six operating segments 
to more accurately reflect our current operations  executive reporting structure and organization  and internal reporting we modified our segment structure and reporting to reflect that we operate through four operating segments each led by a different senior executive that reports directly to our chief executive officer 
the changes made to arrive at the four segments from the six previous segments were that the former semicon associates segment is now included in the advanced ceramics operations segment and the former ceradyne canada segment is now included in the boron segment 
all of the financial data for  and have been changed to reflect four segments 
the following table includes a summary of our products by applications and locations as of december  for our four segments 
in january  we announced the acquisition of viox corporation

because of the significant increase in our sales to the energy markets and our strategy to direct more of our resources and development efforts to this sector of the economy  we are adding the energy sector as a fifth market application or sector of the economy 
previously  sales to the energy sector have been reported in the industrial category 
the tables below show the amount of sales in millions and the percentage contribution of our total sales to external customers of each market application or sector of the economy in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial energy automotive diesel commercial total year ended december  defense industrial energy automotive diesel commercial total the principal factor contributing to our growth in sales from through was increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers  which was driven primarily by military conflicts such as those in iraq and afghanistan 
this demand was driven by recognition of the performance and life saving benefits of utilizing advanced technical ceramics in lightweight body armor 
our sales declined in primarily because of a reduction in shipments of body armor 
our sales declined in primarily because of a continued reduction in shipments of body armor and also due to a decline in sales of our industrial  automotive diesel and commercial market product lines due to the severe economic recession 
in  sales of body armor continued to decline 
however  sales from energy related products grew by in when compared to most of this growth in energy sales was generated by sales of our ceramic crucibles used in the production of photovoltaic cells for solar panels 
additionally  sales of industrial and automotive diesel products rebounded sharply  particularly at our esk ceramics subsidiary 
commencing in  several strategic acquisitions  which are described below  have also contributed to our sales growth 
to illustrate the impact of body armor  energy related products and our acquisitions  the following table shows our sales from body armor  from energy related products  from our acquisitions  and from all other sources for each of the years through in millions 
sales from body armor sales from energy products gross sales from energy products less sales from energy products included in acquisitions sales from energy products due to organic growth sales from acquisitions all other sales total sales sales of ceramic body armor represented the majority  and most volatile  portion of our defense business  rising from approximately million  or of our total sales in  to a peak of approximately million  or of our total sales in  and then declining to approximately million  or of our total sales in shipments of the first generation of ceramic body armor  known as small armed protective inserts  or sapi  began before and accelerated rapidly with the onset of the war in afghanistan in and thereafter the war in iraq 
shipments of the second generation of ceramic body armor  known as enhanced small armed protective inserts  or esapi  began in the military s subsequent decision to deploy esapi body armor full fleet  that is  to replace all sapi body armor with the new esapi body armor  and the introduction in of enhanced side ballistic inserts  known as esbi  which protect the sides of the soldier s torso  resulted in continued growth in our sales of ceramic body armor  ultimately reaching our peak sales of body armor in once full fleet was achieved  our sales of body armor began a steady decline 
in october  we were awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity  or id iq  contract by the us army for the next ballistic threat generation of ceramic body armor plates  called xsapi  as well as for the current generation esapi plates 
this five year contract has a maximum value of billion and allows the us army to order either xsapi or esapi body armor from us 
through december   we have shipped million of body armor against delivery orders received by us under this id iq contract  and we expect to ship an additional million under existing orders during with less than three years remaining under this id iq contract and the wars in iraq and afghanistan winding down  we expect that the total amount of body armor that we ultimately ship under this contract will be substantially less than the maximum amount 
for and for the next several years  we expect that our sales of body armor will continue  but at more moderate levels than in the past 
we believe there will continue to be a viable replacement business for body armor inserts that is procured through the defense supply center philadelphia dscp and directly through the army 
we will also continue to bid on foreign military sales fms for the first generation of sapi body armor through our existing id iq contract with aberdeen proving grounds 
although we believe that demand for ceramic body armor will continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations  positions and strategies of the current us government  the level of international conflicts and the deployment of armed forces 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process and may be cancelled by the government at any time without penalty 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on our ability to successfully compete for and retain this business 
the following acquisitions resulted from a strategy to grow and expand our non defense business through the selective acquisition of companies and product lines closely related to our core competency in advanced technical ceramics and materials  as well as to expand our defense business with complementary product lines on an opportunistic basis 
we acquired esk ceramics in august based in kempten  germany  esk ceramics manufactures industrial technical ceramic powders and advanced technical ceramic products 
this acquisition provided us with both a broad line of non defense products  and it assured us of a supply of boron carbide powder  which serves as a starter ceramic powder in the manufacture of our lightweight ceramic body armor 
the lower demand for body armor since has negatively impacted inter segment sales of boron carbide powder by our esk ceramics subsidiary to our advanced ceramic operations division 
in june  we purchased the assets and technology related to the boral line of aluminum metal matrix composites that serve as part of a barrier system for spent fuel storage in the nuclear industry 
we moved these assets to our ceradyne canada facility in chicoutimi  quebec  canada 
this product line is now included in our boron operating segment 
minco  inc  which we acquired in july  is included in our thermo materials operating segment 
based in midway  tennessee  minco manufactures fused silica powders for a wide range of industrial applications 
the fused silica powder manufactured by minco is a key raw material that our thermo materials division uses to manufacture missile radomes nose cones and ceramic crucibles that our customers use for melting silicon in the photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing process  as well as being sold as a mold for precision investment casting 
we acquired eaglepicher boron  llc in august this subsidiary  which we renamed boron products  llc  is included in our boron operating segment and produces the boron isotope b 
this isotope is a strong neutron absorber and is used for both nuclear waste containment and nuclear power plant neutron radiation critical control 
boron products also produces complementary chemical isotopes used in the normal operation and control of nuclear power plants 
the boron isotope b is used in the semiconductor manufacturing process as an additive to semiconductor grade silicon as a doping agent and where ultra high purity boron is required 
in june  we purchased certain assets and technology related to proprietary technical ceramic bearings used for down hole oil drilling and for coal bed methane pumps and steam assisted oil extraction pumps 
this technology and product line  which we include in our advanced ceramic operations operating segment  are located in our lexington  kentucky  facility 
these bearings incorporate ceramic parts supplied by our esk ceramics subsidiary 
in august  we acquired semequip  inc  a late stage startup technology company located in billerica  massachusetts 
semequip develops and markets cluster molecules such as bh for use in the ion implantation of boron b in the manufacture of semiconductors 
semequip  which we include in our boron operating segment  owns a portfolio of approximately issued and pending us patents  and corresponding issued and pending patents in several foreign countries 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the business and assets and all technology and intellectual property related to ballistic combat and non combat helmets of diaphorm technologies  llc  based in salem  new hampshire 
based on this technology  we submitted a proposal to the us marine corps systems command in june in response to a solicitation for the procurement of enhanced combat helmets ech  which are intended to provide substantially increased levels of protection compared to combat helmets now in use 
in late july  in response to our proposal  the us marine corps system command awarded us a contract for up to a maximum of  helmets 
after an extended period of testing  we received an order for first article test helmets  which we delivered in january and february our strategy regarding this acquisition is to combine our successful track record in body armor programs with the proprietary helmet forming technologies acquired from diaphorm to create a world class manufacturer of enhanced combat helmets 
the us government is continuing to attempt to qualify other ech manufacturers 
we acquired viox corporation on january  located in seattle  washington  viox develops  manufactures and markets specialty glass compositions for a wide range of electronic  industrial and health care markets 
viox will be included in our advanced ceramic operations operating segment 
viox has developed a specialty glass formulation for polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic solar applications 
viox customers add electrically conducting powdered metals such as silver or aluminum to the viox powdered specialty glass 
many of the ultimate solar users of viox glass are also customers for ceradyne s high purity ceramic solar crucibles 
our order backlog was million as of december  and million as of december  orders for ceramic armor encompassing body  vehicle and other miscellaneous armor represented approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  and million  or of the total backlog as of december  of the total ceramic armor  orders for ceramic body armor amounted to approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  and million  or of the total backlog as of december  we expect that substantially all of our order backlog as of december  will be shipped during our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied in recent years  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or of net sales in  and million  or of net sales in we currently have sales offices in germany  china  england and canada as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our sales to customers located outside the united states  were denominated in us dollars during net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenues from the sale of products  which we recognize when an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order and collection is reasonably assured 
we may reduce revenue with reserves for sales returns 
allowances for sales returns  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  are based upon historical sales returns 
we did not include a sales return provision at december   and because our historical experience with sales returns leads us to conclude that no allowance for sales returns is necessary 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses associated with production efforts  which we also include in cost of product sales 
the cost of electricity comprises a significant portion of our cost of product sales 
our high electricity utilization is a direct result of the use of high temperature furnaces to hot press ceramic body armor inserts and to sinter silicon nitride sin for industrial products 
several years ago  we recognized the need to mitigate the cost of electricity and in we embarked on a plan to move production from california to lexington  kentucky 
to date  we have moved all of our sin furnaces to kentucky and have established three new hot press lines in kentucky 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed our hot press manufacturing operation in costa mesa  california as a result of reduced demand for ceramic body armor and the high cost of doing business in the state  especially the high cost of electricity  which is integral to our manufacturing operations 
the electricity cost in kentucky is more stable than california because of the presence of coal fired power plants 
the price of electricity in kentucky has been stable for the past three years and is projected by our supplier to continue to be stable over the next few years 
we have a policy of locating new production facilities that require high levels of electricity in regions of the world that have either available hydroelectric or coal fired power plants 
the cost of electricity for our manufacturing operations in the united states and europe was approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  and approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in management utilizes utility industry specialists and consultants to help manage and implement strategies to minimize annual energy price increases at our advanced ceramic operations california facilities 
for other locations in the united states and germany  management s strategy is to enter into long term contracts to obtain fixed price increases in order to increase its ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and ensure a stable cost structure 
fluctuations in the cost of electricity affect our ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and consequently our profitability 
if the cost of electricity were to increase substantially  our gross profit margins may decline 
with regard to significant costs for raw materials that impact our gross margins  we rely on two critical materials to make ceramic body armor boron carbide powder  which is the principal raw material used in the production of ceramic armor plates  and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene textile material  which we laminate to the surface of the ceramic armor plates 
we obtain substantially all of our boron carbide powder from our subsidiary  esk ceramics  which has been a supplier of boron carbide powder to us for over years 
boron carbide is made from borax and boric acid through a complicated furnace process 
historically  these raw material products have not experienced significant price and supply instability and consequently we have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of boron carbide material from esk ceramics 
we have further identified a second source of boron carbide from a supplier that utilizes crude boron carbide from china and does the finishing in the united states 
the crude boron carbide from china is inexpensive and offers a method to mitigate any internal cost increases at esk ceramics through the use of lower cost china material as part of the esk ceramics raw material mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements for future products  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
change in accounting for convertible debt in may  the fasb staff issued new accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial settlement which specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the company adopted this new guidance as of january   and the adoption impacted the historical accounting for our senior subordinated convertible notes due december  the notes 
the implementation of this new accounting guidance for convertible debt resulted in the following retrospective changes in long term debt  debt issuance costs included in other noncurrent assets  deferred tax liability  additional paid in capital and retained earnings in thousands net increase decrease long term debt debt issuance costs deferred tax liability additional paid in capital retained earnings allocation of long term debt proceeds and issuance costs to equity component on issuance date cumulative retrospective impact from amortization of discount on liability component and debt issuance costs cumulative retrospective impact at january  retrospective impact from amortization of discount on liability component and debt issuance costs during the year cumulative retrospective impact at december  the adoption of the new accounting guidance also resulted in increased interest expense of approximately million and decreased net income by million in the retrospective impact to earnings per share was a decrease of in as of december  and  the long term debt and the equity component recorded in additional paid in capital  net of income tax benefit  determined in accordance with the new accounting guidance for convertible debt  comprised the following in thousands december  december  long term debt principal amount unamortized discount net carrying amount equity component  net of income tax benefit the discount on the liability component of long term debt is being amortized using the effective interest method based on an annual effective rate of  which represented the market interest rate for similar debt without a conversion option on the issuance date  through december  which coincides with the first date that holders of the notes can exercise their put option  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing at page f of this report 
the amount of interest expense recognized relating to both the contractual interest coupon and the amortization of the discount on the liability component was million in  million in and million in results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of net sales

overall  net sales for the year ended december  of our defense related products were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year as shipments of body armor were sharply lower due to reduced demand from the us military 
sales for the year ended december  of energy products amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year as sales of ceramic crucibles to the solar industry continued to grow 
sales for the year ended december  of industrial products amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales to the automotive diesel market represented of sales for the year ended december  and of sales for the year ended december  the recent events in the automotive industry have not had a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity 
we have not experienced any modifications to payment terms due to issues involving customer liquidity in this industry segment 
our net sales of commercial products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
our advanced ceramic operations segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the primary reason for lower net sales was that shipments of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in shipments was a reduction in demand for xsapi and esapi body armor from us by the us army and our unsuccessful bid during the year ended december  for additional xsapi body armor 
net sales of xsapi body armor for the twelve months ending december  were million 
offsetting the decline in body armor were sales of combat vehicle armor amounting to million  an increase of million  or  from million and an increase in sales of automotive diesel products to million  an increase of million  or  from million due primarily to the increase in production of heavy duty diesel trucks 
in addition  sales of industrial wear products increased by million in  due to the slight rebound in general economic conditions 
our esk ceramics segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales on a constant currency basis  sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million from the prior year 
we computed sales on a constant currency basis by calculating sales in actual euros and applying a monthly average foreign exchange rate of the euro to the us dollar during  which was then compared to actual sales in u 
s dollars 
sales of industrial products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increases in sales for industrial and automotive diesel products were the result of our achieving increase in unit prices of several product lines and a slight rebound in general economic conditions during sales of defense products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
included in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were inter segment sales of million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million of shipments to our advanced ceramic operations segment 
the balance of the decrease was due to a reduction in sales of boron carbide powder to third parties in the defense industry for the year ended december   because their sales of ceramic body armor declined 
our thermo materials segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the primary reasons for this increase were sales of ceramic crucibles to the solar industry totaling million  an increase of million  or  from million of sales in the prior year 
average unit selling prices of ceramic crucibles were constant during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  selling prices declined slightly in the first quarter of year due to increased price competition 
also contributing to the increase were sales to the precision investment casting and refractory industries of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year  due to a slight rebound in the industrial sector of the economy 
sales to the defense industry for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year due to an increase in shipments of ceramic missile radomes 
our boron segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the primary reasons for this increase in net sales were sales to the nuclear industry that totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year and sales to the semiconductor industry of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
gross profit our total gross profit for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  were caused primarily by an improved sales mix  especially by increased sales of ceramic crucibles  an increase in gross profit at our esk segment due to increased operating leverage and the pass through of price increases on certain industrial product lines at our aco and esk segments 
also contributing to the increase in gross profits were higher sales and production volumes of most of our industrial product lines caused by increased demand brought on by the recent slight economic rebound 
our advanced ceramics operation segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in were lower volumes of production of body armor and industrial products resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses  higher scrap rates incurred in the production of body armor especially in xsapi  and poorer sales mix caused by increased shipments of xsapi body armor which have lower gross margins than our other body armor products 
our esk ceramics segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in were the result of price increases to customers for certain product lines  a favorable sales mix  a decrease in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses caused by higher production volumes  and higher sales of all product lines due to increased demand for our products as a result of the recent slight economic rebound 
gross profit in was adversely impacted by the million of charge for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in connection with the closing of the facility in bazet  france 
additional information regarding this plant closure is provided below under the caption restructuring plant closure and severance 
our thermo materials segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage gross profit increased in due to higher production rates of our crucibles allowing more absorption of manufacturing costs per unit produced 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was increased sales of industrial and refractory products due to the recent economic expansion resulting in a decrease of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses compared to the prior year 
our boron segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the increase in gross profits in was the result of higher sales to the semiconductor and nuclear industries  and a favorable sales mix 
of the million increase in gross profit  million was from additional gross profit from sales of products to the nuclear and semiconductor industries and improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
this increase was partially offset by an increase of million in negative gross profit from semequip  inc to a negative million gross profit in the year ending december   from a negative million in the prior year 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions operating expenses increase decrease in operating expenses percentage change in operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses increase decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses percentage change in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  percentage of net sales the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to a reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in transaction expenses in connection with our acquisition of viox corporation that was closed in january research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions research and development expenses increase decrease in research and development expenses percentage change in research and development expenses research and development as a percentage of net sales the primary reasons for the decrease in research and development expenses were the reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses 
acquisition related charges 
our acquisition related charges for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions acquisition related charges increase decrease in acquisition related charges percentage change in acquisition related charges not meaningful not meaningful acquisition related charges as a percentage of net sales we incurred an acquisition related charge of million for the year ended december  associated with the adjustment of economic assumptions regarding our purchase of the assets of diaphorm  llc in during the fourth quarter of  we revised the estimated future sales and earnings of diaphorm  which caused an increase to the estimated acquisition liability and a charge to pre tax earnings for the year ended december  restructuring plant closure and severance 
our restructuring plant closure and severance expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions restructuring plant closure and severance increase decrease in restructuring plant closure and severance percentage change in restructuring plant closure and severance not meaningful restructuring plant closure and severance as a percentage of net sales we recorded pre tax restructuring and severance charges of million for the year ended december  in connection with the closing of our hot pressing lines at our facility in costa mesa  california 
we made this decision to close this facility as a cost cutting measure to reduce our capacity due to the reduction in body armor demand from peak levels of the past several years 
we recorded pre tax restructuring and severance changes of million for the year ended december  in connection with the closing of our facility in bazet  france 
these decisions were consistent with our ongoing objective to lower the costs of our manufacturing operations 
goodwill impairment 
our goodwill impairment expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions goodwill impairment increase decrease in goodwill impairment percentage change in goodwill impairment not meaningful not meaningful goodwill impairment as a percentage of net sales we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of for the goodwill associated with our ceradyne canada operating segment  which is now included in our boron operating segment 
for additional information regarding this impairment charge and our annual test of goodwill for impairment  refer to the discussion of goodwill impairment contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing at page f of this report 
other income expense 
our other income expense for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions other income expense increase decrease in other income expense percentage change in other income expense other income expense as a percentage of net sales we incurred losses from auction rate securities of million in in and million in we also had a gain on the early extinguishment of debt in and we had none in interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million because we bought back million of the total million principal of our convertible bond in interest income increased by million in because we slightly increased the maturity of our investments 
income taxes 
our benefit provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions benefit provision for income taxes increase decrease in benefit provision for income taxes percentage change in benefit provision for income taxes not meaningful not meaningful benefit provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales the tax benefit in resulted from a net benefit of million resulting from the settlement of a refund claim with the state of california and a  reversal of the liability for uncertain tax positions 
the tax benefit in resulted from a reversal of liability for uncertain tax positions as well as the tax benefits from the expenses and losses due to the closure of our bazet  france manufacturing facility 
we also had a significant part of our pre tax income originating from our operations in china where we were granted a full tax holiday for and a reduced statutory tax rate of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our total net sales for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the main causes of the decrease in sales were a reduction in body armor shipments and a reduction in sales at our esk ceramics subsidiary due to the recent economic contraction 
overall  net sales for the year ended december  of our defense related products were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year and our sales of industrial products amounted to million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year and our net sales of commercial products were million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the contraction of the global economy was a major reason for the decline in our sales volume and resulting gross profit in our industrial  automotive diesel and commercial business lines 
also  contributing to the decline was a decrease in per unit sales prices of crucibles due to increased price competition 
our advanced ceramic operations segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the primary reason for the decrease in sales during the year ended was that shipments of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in shipments was a reduction in demand for esapi body armor sets from us by the us army because they achieved their targeted goal of  total sets of esapi received from all suppliers since this targeted goal of shipments was met at the end of september we received our first production order for the newest ballistic threat generation of body armor  xsapi  plates on march  for million under the id iq contract discussed above under overview  and commenced shipments during april net sales of xsapi body armor for the year ended december  were million 
other decreases in sales were from reductions in sales of combat vehicle armor of million 
also contributing to the decrease in sales was a million decline in shipments of automotive diesel products due primarily to the reduction in production of heavy duty diesel trucks which was a result of the severe economic contraction during in addition  sales of industrial wear products declined by million in  also due to the severe economic contraction 
sales to the automotive diesel market represented of sales for the year ended december  and of sales for the year ended december  the recent events in the automotive industry have not had a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity 
we have not experienced any modifications to payment terms due to issues involving customer liquidity in this industry segment 
our esk ceramics segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales on a constant currency basis  sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
we computed sales on a constant currency basis by calculating sales in actual euros and applying a monthly average foreign exchange rate of the euro to the us dollar during  which was then compared to actual sales in u 
s dollars 
sales of industrial products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decreases in sales for industrial and automotive diesel products were primarily the result of the severe economic contraction during sales of defense products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
included in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were inter segment sales of million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million of shipments to our advanced ceramic operations division 
the balance of the decrease was due to a reduction in sales of boron carbide powder to third parties in the defense industry for the year ended december   because their sales of ceramic body armor declined 
our thermo materials segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions  net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the primary reasons for the decrease in sales in were a reduction of million in the sales of precision investment casting products and a million reduction in refractory product sales  both due to the severe economic recession 
revenue from crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
this decrease was caused by lower per unit sales prices due to increased price competition while units sold increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
sales to the defense industry during the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million when compared to the prior year 
our boron segment had net sales for the year ended december  and as follows dollars in millions net sales increase decrease in net sales percentage change in net sales the increase in sales in resulted from additional shipments to the nuclear industry of million and was offset by a decline in sales to the semiconductor industry of  additionally  financial results included a full year of semequip s operations compared to less than five months of results in as semequip was acquired in august gross profit our total gross profit for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was caused primarily by substantially lower sales of body armor  and reduced operating leverage resulting in less absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses in the production of body armor 
our body armor product line was responsible for million of the total decrease in gross profit in compared to also contributing to the decline in gross profits were lower sales and production volumes of most of our industrial product lines caused by reduced demand brought on by the recent sharp economic contraction  resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses 
however  we did realize increases in gross profit of million from a growth in sales to the nuclear industry  million from expanding sales of products to the semiconductor industry  both by our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  and million from improvement in sales of ceramic radomes to the defense industry by our thermo materials division 
our advanced ceramics operation segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in were lower volumes of production of body armor and industrial products resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses  higher scrap rates incurred in the production of body armor  and poorer sales mix caused by shipments of lower gross margin sapi and xsapi body armor products compared to the prior year 
our esk ceramics segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales in were the result of an unfavorable sales mix due to lower sales of ceramic powder for armor applications  an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses caused by lower production volumes  and lower sales of all product lines due to reduced demand for our products as a result of the recent economic contraction 
gross profit was also adversely impacted by the million of charges for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in connection with the closing of the facility in bazet  france 
additional information regarding this plant closure is provided below under the caption restructuring plant closure and severance 
our thermo materials segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the primary reason gross profit decreased in was due to lower unit sales prices of crucibles due to increased price competition  while costs did not decline proportionately 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit was lower sales of industrial and refractory products due to the recent world wide economic contraction resulting in an increase of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead expenses compared to the prior year 
our boron segment had total gross profit for the years ended december  and as follows dollars in millions gross profit increase decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage the increase in gross margin was the result of additional sales of products to the nuclear industry and improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions operating expenses increase decrease in operating expenses percentage change in operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses increase decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses percentage change in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  percentage of net sales the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due to a reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses  and reduced bonuses due to lower pre tax income in as compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in selling expenses  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions research and development expenses increase decrease in research development expenses percentage change in research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales the primary reasons for the decrease in research and development expenses were the reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in research and development expenses 
acquisition related charge 
our acquisition related charges for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions acquisition related charges increase decrease in acquisition related charges percentage change in acquisition related charges not meaningful not meaningful acquisition related charges as a percentage of net sales we incurred an acquisition related compensation charge of million for the year ended december  associated with a pre closing commitment by semequip  inc for incentive compensation for several of its employees and advisors 
this million charge included million of cash paid by ceradyne at the closing of this acquisition  and the balance represents the discounted present value of the portion of the estimated contingent consideration payable as incentive compensation to these employees and advisors over years 
during the third quarter of  we revised the estimated future sales and earnings of semequip  which caused a million reduction in the estimated acquisition liability and a credit to pre tax earnings for the year ended december  restructuring plant closure and severance 
our restructuring plant closure and severance expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions restructuring plant closure and severance increase decrease in restructuring plant closure and severance percentage change in restructuring plant closure and severance not meaningful restructuring plant closure and severance  percentage of net sales included in restructuring plant closure and severance charges in are million due to the closing of our manufacturing facility in bazet  france owned by our esk ceramics france subsidiary and million of severance charges consisting of million in the united states and million in germany during the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we made a strategic decision to close this manufacturing plant 
during the year ended december   we recognized pre tax charges of million for the closure of the bazet facility which included severance and related costs  and contract termination costs of million  and legal and other closure costs of million 
we also incurred million for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets that is reported in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  the severance charge was recognized as a postemployment benefit as the company s obligation related to employees rights to receive compensation for future absences was attributable to employees services already rendered  the obligation relates to rights that legally vest  payment of the compensation is probable  and the amount could be reasonably estimated based on local statutory requirements 
we made this decision as a cost cutting measure to eliminate losses that were incurred at this facility due to the recent severe economic contraction 
this decision is consistent with our ongoing objective to lower the costs of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  esk ceramics france reduced its workforce by approximately employees  primarily composed of manufacturing  production and additional support staff at the plant 
affected employees were eligible for a severance package that includes severance pay  continuation of benefits and outplacement services 
the plant was completely closed by the end of calendar year 
goodwill impairment 
our goodwill impairment expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions goodwill impairment increase decrease in goodwill impairment percentage change in goodwill impairment not meaningful goodwill impairment as a percentage of net sales we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of for the goodwill associated with our ceradyne canada operating segment  which is now included in our boron operating segment 
we determined that the demand for our boral product line  which was a large part of the revenue of the ceradyne canada operating and reporting unit  continued to decline and that this condition required a goodwill impairment test before the annual test for this reporting unit 
to complete the test for impairment  we utilized discounted cash flow methodology  which requires the forecasting of cash flows and requires the selection of discount rates 
we used available information to make these fair value estimates  including discount rates  commensurate with the risks relevant to our business 
based on the goodwill impairment test performed on the ceradyne canada reporting unit  we recorded a million impairment charge  which was recognized in the second quarter of for additional information regarding this impairment charge  refer to the discussion of goodwill impairment contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statement commencing at page f of this report 
during the second quarter of  we also conducted a test on the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to determine whether there was impairment on our long lived assets in our ceradyne canada reporting unit 
based on the analysis of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows for this reporting unit  we determined that there was no impairment of the long lived assets for the ceradyne canada reporting unit 
the valuation methodologies and the underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance  terminal growth rate and the selection of an appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the long term projections used in the valuation were developed as a part of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
the discount rate used in the valuation was selected based upon an analysis of comparable companies and included adjustments made to account for our specific attributes such as size and industry 
the test for long lived asset impairment resulted in no impairment of those assets at december  additionally  the test for goodwill impairment resulted in no impairment of goodwill at december  at the time of the completion of our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   we believed that the cash flow projections we used in determining fair value already appropriately reflected our revised forecast of our financial performance for while the reduction in sales volume to the us government and the recent severe economic downturn has impacted all of our reporting units  we believe that the fundamentals of our businesses remain solid and the long term outlook for our industry remains strong 
our valuation models assume the restoration of long term market stability after a near term period of no growth 
all reporting units had fair values which exceeded carrying values by at least as of december  additionally  a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
other income expense 
our other income expense for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions other income expense increase decrease in other income expense percentage change in other income expense other income expense as a percentage of net sales the increase in other income expense was primarily caused by a reduction of million in interest income on our cash balances and short term marketable securities because of a substantial decline in interest rates in this was offset by a reduction of million of losses on auction rate securities compared to the losses incurred in and a gain on an early extinguishment of debt of million 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year because we bought back million of the total million principal of our convertible bond 
income taxes 
our benefit provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in millions benefit provision for income taxes increase decrease in benefit provision for income taxes percentage change in benefit provision for income taxes not meaningful benefit provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the tax benefit in resulted from a reversal of liability for uncertain tax positions as well as the tax benefits from the expenses and losses due to the closure of our bazet  france manufacturing facility 
we also had part of our pre tax income originating from our operations in china where we did not pay income tax 
income taxes also decreased because pre tax income was lower in compared to liquidity and capital resources we generally have met our operating and capital requirements with cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the two years ended december  and in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments accounts receivable  net inventories  net working capital annual operating cash flow during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million for the year ended december  the million of cash flow from operations during is primarily comprised of net income totaling million  with million of non cash charges included therein  offset by a reduction in net operating assets and liabilities of million  mostly due to an increase in prepaid taxes as we have applied for tax refunds by amending previous years income tax returns 
we invested million to expand manufacturing capacity in selected product lines  of which million was spent for the expansion of our facilities in china 
we also used million to buy back  shares of our stock 
in an effort to increase yield  as of december  we had invested a net additional million in marketable securities as compared to the end of as a result  our net cash at december  declined by million as compared to a million decrease during the year ended december  investing activities consumed million of cash during the year ended december  we invested million for the purchase of marketable securities as we extended the maturities of our investments in an attempt to increase our return 
we also spent million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
included in this amount are million for improvements in the production of ceramic crucibles at our china and atlanta facilities and million for the ongoing implementation of our sap software system 
these expenditures for investing activities were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
financing activities during the year ended december  consumed million 
during the year ended december   we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
to date  we have purchased and retired a cumulative total of  at an aggregate cost of million 
we are authorized to repurchase and retire an additional million for a total of million 
the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december  was due to our investment in our german subsidiary  esk ceramics  and in our two chinese subsidiaries  ceradyne tianjin technical ceramics  ltd 
and ceradyne tianjin advanced materials co  ltd 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million for the year ended december  the million of cash flow from operations during is primarily comprised of net income totaling million  with million of non cash charges included therein  and a reduction in net operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired  of million  mostly due to lower revenues during the year 
we invested million to expand manufacturing capacity in selected product lines and million to acquire the assets and business of diaphorm technologies llc  as explained more fully elsewhere 
we also used million to buy back our stock and million to acquire a portion of our outstanding convertible debt  as described more fully below 
in an effort to increase yield  as of december  we had invested a net additional million in marketable securities as compared to the end of as a result  our net cash at december  declined by million as compared to a million increase during the year ended december  investing activities consumed million of cash during the year ended december  this included million for the acquisition of substantially all of the business and assets and all technology and intellectual property related to ballistic combat and non combat helmets of diaphorm technologies  llc  based in salem  new hampshire 
we invested million for the purchase of marketable securities as we extended the maturities of our investments in an attempt to increase our return 
we also spent million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
included in this amount is million for improvements in the production of ceramic crucibles at our china and atlanta facilities and million for the ongoing implementation of our sap software system 
these expenditures for investing activities were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
financing activities during the year ended december  consumed million 
during the year ended december   we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
we also purchased and retired an aggregate of million principal amount of our convertible debt for million reducing the outstanding balance of the notes to million 
of the million expenditure for the retirement of the debt  million is reflected in financing activities and the balance of million was attributable to payments of accreted interest on the debt discount and is reflected in cash flows from operating activities 
we have million remaining of the original million authorization by our board of directors to repurchase and retire part of the outstanding notes 
the carrying amount of the notes purchased was million and the estimated fair value of the notes exclusive of the conversion feature was million 
the difference between the carrying amount of million and the estimated fair value of million was recognized as a gain of million upon early extinguishment of debt  which was partially offset by write off of associated unamortized debt issuance costs of  resulting in a net gain of million 
the difference between the estimated fair value of million and the purchase price of million was million and was charged to additional paid in capital 
in may  the fasb staff issued new accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement which specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december  was due to our investment in our german subsidiary  esk ceramics  and in our chinese subsidiary  ceradyne tianjin technical ceramics  ltd 
during december  we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due december  as referenced above  we purchased and retired an aggregate of million principal amount of our convertible debt for million reducing the outstanding balance of the notes to million 
interest on the notes is payable on december and june of each year  commencing on june  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount of the notes which represents a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes contain put options  which may require us to repurchase in cash all or a portion of the notes on december   december   december   december   and december  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to but excluding the repurchase date 
for further information regarding the notes  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing at page f of this report 
in december  we established an unsecured million line of credit which expires on march  we expect to renew the line of credit at that time for multiple years 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts on the line of credit 
however  the available line of credit at december  has been reduced by outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million 
the interest rate on the credit line was as of december  which was based on the libor rate for a period of one month  plus a margin of percent 
pursuant to the bank line of credit  we are subject to certain covenants  which include  among other things  the maintenance of specified minimum amounts of net income and liquidity 
at december   we were not in compliance with the covenant that required minimum annual net income of million 
we received a waiver of this covenant during february we were in compliance with all covenants at december  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  compared to million at december  our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from our esk ceramics subsidiary does not result in additional tax costs 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash available from the sale of short term investments  cash available from borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our anticipated capital requirements for primarily relate to normal replacements of equipment and the completion of the initial expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china that will have a total cost of approximately million  of which we expect to spend approximately million we are also reviewing plans for a second expansion of our china facilities that may cost approximately million to million 
to finance the initial expansion in china  we used cash generated from our china operations during  approximately million of our existing cash balances held in our bank accounts in china  and the balance was funded from our existing cash balances in the united states 
for the second phase of the expansion  we plan to use cash generated from our china operations during we also may utilize cash  and  to the extent necessary  borrowings from time to time to acquire other businesses  technologies or product lines that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage  technical capabilities or production capacity  or offer growth opportunities 
we have no present agreements for any material acquisitions 
our material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years debt  principal amount capital lease obligations non cancelable leases pension benefits information technology systems cash commitments for interest expense utility contract total contractual obligations as of december  we have million of uncertain tax positions 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding settlement of these uncertain tax positions  and as a result  they have been excluded from the table 
off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet arrangement is the conversion feature of our convertible senior subordinated notes discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this report 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any temporary or other than temporary impairment of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses the assistance of outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order  title has been transferred and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we may reduce revenue with reserves for sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  are based upon historical sales returns 
we did not include a sales return provision at december  and because our historical experience with sales returns leads us to conclude that no allowance for sales returns is necessary 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due based on contractual terms 
a write off will occur if the settlement of the account receivable is less than the carrying amount or we ultimately determine the balance will not be collected 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the financial statements included in this report beginning on page f inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not being amortized  but instead is subject to an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill as of the fiscal year end in the fourth quarter of each year 
goodwill is allocated to four reporting units  which represent the company s operating segments 
the company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 
the company s reporting units are advanced ceramic operations  thermo materials  esk ceramics  and boron 
the company compares the fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value 
fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows and market multiples for each business unit with significant goodwill 
we compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the use of discounted cash flows requires that we make various economic  market and business assumptions in developing our internal forecasts  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital that reflect our best estimates when performing the annual impairment test 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
however  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change in the future which may then cause us to later conclude that an impairment exists  or with hindsight  it may appear that we could have understated the extent of impairment based on new information that was unknown at the prior testing date 
we may incur a goodwill impairment charge in the future  if for example  the market price of our stock materially declines  if the financial results of our operations deteriorate or other circumstances require an impairment charge 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the economic consumption method 
pension 
the company provides pension benefits to its employees of its subsidiaries of esk ceramics and ceradyne boron products 
for the pension plans of both subsidiaries  we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
these key assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plans 
this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
a hypothetical basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on assets would change pension expense by  the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due 
a hypothetical basis point change in the discount rate would change the pension obligation by approximately million 
the impact on pension expense from a hypothetical basis point change in the discount rate would not be material 
in addition the expense and liabilities of the plan were determined using other assumptions for future experience  such as mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated  which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense 
recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements which could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than two years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
our long term investments at december   included million of auction rate securities  net of a pre tax temporary impairment charge of million against accumulated other comprehensive income and a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge of million against earnings 
the company s investments in auction rate securities represent interests in insurance securitizations collateralized by pools of residential and commercial mortgages  asset backed securities and other structured credits relating to the credit risk of various bond guarantors that mature at various dates from june through july these auction rate securities were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process which is scheduled every days  that resets the applicable interest rate  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
interest rates are capped at a floating rate of one month libor plus additional spread ranging from to depending on prevailing rating 
during the second half of the year  through and through december   the auctions for these securities failed 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  auctions for our investment in these securities are inactive 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid through the normal auction process and may be liquidated if a buyer is found outside the auction process 
although the auctions have failed and are currently inactive  the company continues to receive underlying cash flows in the form of interest income from the investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   the fair value of the company s investments in auction rate securities was below cost by approximately million 
the fair value of the auction rate securities has been below cost for more than two years 
with respect to our investments in auction rate securities  we categorized the investments into three main categories for analytical purposes which comprised insurance wrapped securities  put right securities and credit derivative product company securities 
the insurance wrapped category comprised auction rate securities where the payments are guaranteed by an insurance company  such as a monoline financial guaranty insurance company 
the put right category comprised an auction rate security that was created to provide capital to the issuer in the event that the issuer exercised the put right 
the credit derivative product company category comprised auction rate securities where the issuer is a financial services company that offers credit risk protection of structured financial assets in the form of credit derivatives 
the auction rate securities issued by these financial services companies were created as a way to provide collateral for the issuers to use for entering into credit default swaps 
during  we sold all of our investments in the credit derivative product company category 
as part of our evaluation as to whether the decline in fair value of the auction rate securities was other than temporary  where it was probable that the company would not collect all contractual cash flows and the remaining balance was not recoverable  we considered factors which included  but were not limited to  general market conditions  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the securities  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
subsequent increases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income  subsequent decreases in fair value  if not an other than temporary impairment  are included in other comprehensive income 
also  due to the illiquid market for the auction rate securities and limited availability of public information on these securities  we engaged a third party investment banking firm to assist us in performing the valuation of the securities 
our valuation analysis used a trinomial discount model where the compilations of future cash flows were priced by summing the present values of the future principal and interest payments 
we then forecasted probabilities of default  auction failure  and a successful auction at par or repurchase at par for each period  as well as forecasted recovery rates in default for each of the securities 
finally  we discounted the weighted average cash flow for each period back to present value at the determined discount rate for each of the securities 
based on the information included in prospectuses and other data compiled for each of the auction rate securities for the years ended december  and  we determined that the decline in fair values of the put right securities and credit derivative product company securities categories were other than temporary 
this determination considered the terms of guarantees associated with the securities  the quality of the underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant available market information compiled with the assistance of the third party investment banking firm 
quantitative data reviewed and analyzed by us also indicated that the cumulative probability of default at some point in the future was more than for the insurance wrapped company securities at the high end of the value range as of december  we believed it was probable that we would collect all contractual cash flows and the carrying value of the securities in the insurance wrapped category as of december  was determined to be recoverable based on the valuation of the securities which considered the terms of certain guarantees  quality of underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant market information 
for the quarter ended june   we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb staff on the effective date of april  in accordance with the new guidance  when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss 
based on our evaluation of the auction rate securities as of december   we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the put right securities before recovery of our amortized cost  accordingly  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges for the decline in fair value during the year ended december  in addition to the above  during the year ended december   we also recognized an other than temporary impairment charge for the credit risk associated with the insurance wrapped securities 
in determining whether a credit loss existed  we used our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security 
we then discounted the expected cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and amortized cost represented the impairment charge for credit risk 
we believe that the carrying value of the securities in the insurance wrapped category  after the adjustment for credit risk  as of december  was determined to be recoverable based on the valuation of the securities which considered the terms of certain guarantees  quality of underlying collateral  external ratings and other relevant market information 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is days  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are not exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt as it is fixed rate debt 
consequently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
