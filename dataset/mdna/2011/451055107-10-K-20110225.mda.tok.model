net income 
the company s net income was million in  compared to net income of million in  as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal capital requirements have been to fund acquisitions  working capital needs  and to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
we have historically relied on internally generated funds to finance our operations and our primary source of capital needs for acquisition has been the issuance of debt and equity securities 
at december  and  our cash totaled million and million  respectively  including short term restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
in march  we completed our acquisition of of mg icon  a limited liability company and owner of the material girl brands  for million  million of which was cash paid to the sellers at closing

further and related to this transaction  we loaned million to beagle scout llc herein referred to as beagle  a company owned by certain schulz family trusts  the proceeds of which were used to pay beagle s portion of the purchase price 
our term loan facility requires us to repay the principal amount of the term loan outstanding in an amount equal to of the excess cash flow of the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for the most recently completed fiscal year  unless we meet certain criteria specified by a financial covenant defined in the term loan facility 
on march   we paid to barclays  for the benefit of the lenders  million  representing of the excess cash flow from the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for as of december   the entire balance due under the term loan facility of approximately million is included in long term debt  less current maturities on the consolidated balance sheet  as the ratio of consolidated total debt as defined by the term loan to consolidated ebitda as defined by the term loan was below to as of december   which eliminated the obligation to pay of the excess cash flow from the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for we believe that cash from future operations as well as currently available cash will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue financing future brand acquisitions through a combination of cash from operations  bank financing and the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of certain prior financings consummated by us 
as of december   we held marketable securities consisting of auction rate securities  herein referred to as ars 
beginning in the third quarter of  million of our ars had failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
in december  the insurer of the ars exercised its put option to replace the underlying securities of the auction rate securities with its preferred securities 
further  although these ars had paid dividends according to their stated terms  the company had received notice from the insurer that the payment of cash dividends will cease after july  and only temporarily reinstated for the week period from december  through january   to be resumed if the board of directors of the insurer declares such cash dividends to be payable at a later date 
no further dividends were received 
in january  we commenced a lawsuit against the broker dealer of these ars alleging  among other things  fraud  and seeking full recovery of the million face value of the ars  as well as legal costs and punitive damages 
in november  the insurer filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
these funds will not be available to us unless we realize recovery through the bankruptcy process  settlement or legal judgment 
prior to the cessation of regular cash dividend payments at week intervals  we estimated the fair value of our ars with a discounted cash flow model where we used the expected rate of cash dividends to be received 
as regular cash dividend payments have ceased  we changed our methodology for estimating the fair value of the ars 
beginning june   we estimated the fair value of our ars using the present value of the weighted average of several scenarios of recovery based on our assessment of the probability of each scenario 
we considered a variety of factors in our analysis including credit rating of the issuer and insurer  comparable market data if available  current macroeconomic market conditions  quality of the underlying securities  and the probabilities of several levels of recovery and reinstatement of cash dividend payments 
as the result of our evaluations and primarily due to the bankruptcy of the insurer of the ars  which reduced the market value of its preferred securities to zero  million of our ars have been written down to zero as a cumulative realized pre tax loss of million to reflect a permanent decrease in fair value 
we believe our cash flow from future operations and our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  regardless of the possibility and timeliness of the recovery of these funds 
changes in working capital at december  and december  the working capital ratio current assets to current liabilities was to and to  respectively 
this increase was driven by a decrease in current portion of long term debt primarily related to our term loan facility details discussed below as well as the factors set forth below operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million  from million in to million in this increase in net cash provided by operating activities of million is primarily due to an increase in net income of approximately million from million in to million in for the reasons discussed above

further  we recorded a million gain on sale of trademarks in for the iconix europe transaction and the joe boxer canada transaction  for which there were no comparable gains in these amounts were partially offset by the aggregate net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of business acquisitions  used in operating activities of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in increased approximately million  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to our purchase of peanuts worldwide for million  as well as million paid in connection with our acquisition of a interest in mg icon 
further  in  we paid million in connection with our acquisition of a controlling stake in iph unltd  the owner of the ecko and zoo york brands

further  in we paid million in connection with our acquisition of a interest in hardy way  the owner of the ed hardy brand 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million  from million of net cash provided by financing activities in to net cash used in financing activities of million in the main driver of this net increase of cash used in financing activities of million was the receipt of million cash in related to our public offering of our common stock in june  with no comparable transaction  and an increase of million in principal payments on our long term debt during as compared to specifically  our payment in march of of the excess cash flow from the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for was million  as compared to our payment in march of of the excess cash flow from the subsidiaries subject to the term loan facility for was million

other 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements for operations and debt servicing for the foreseeable future  primarily with cash flow from operations 
in addition  as part of our business growth strategy  we intend  in addition to growing through the organic development of our brands and expanding internationally  to grow through acquisitions of additional brands 
we anticipate that we would fund any such acquisitions through a combination of cash  the issuance of equity and or debt securities 
the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations  including interest for the periods indicated that existed as of december  s omitted thereafter total convertible notes term loan facility asset backed notes ecko note operating leases earn out payments on acquisitions employment contracts interest total contractual cash obligations other factors we continue to seek to expand and diversify the types of licensed products being produced under our various brands  as well as diversify the distribution channels within which licensed products are sold  in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer  consumer or market sector 
the success of our company  however  will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain brand awareness and contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the us economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  and other factors noted in risk factors  could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where we primarily compete  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
if there were an adverse change in the rate of inflation by less than  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial

this guidance amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities  herein referred to as a vie  by requiring an on going qualitative assessment of which entity has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of a vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
this guidance is effective for us beginning in january  and the results of its adoption has not had a material impact our results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic regarding revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic regarding scope clarification on accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary 
this guidance clarifies that the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions of asc topic applies to a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business  a subsidiary that is a business that is transferred to an equity method investee or a joint venture or an exchange of a group of assets that constitutes a business for a noncontrolling interest in an entity 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of the period in which an entity adopts guidance under asc topic regarding non controlling interests  and if it has been previously adopted  the first interim or annual period ending on or after december   applied retrospectively to the first period that the entity adopted this guidance  and its requirements has not had a material impact our results of operations or financial position

the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure of activity within level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years  and its requirements are reflected herein 
critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for collectability of accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectability considering historical  current and anticipated trends of our licensees related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of its licensees and their retail customers 
due to our licensing model  we do not have any inventory risk and have reduced our operating risks  and can reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums and sales projections provided by our retail licensees 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
in connection with our licensing model  we have entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee sales 
in june  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon our adoption of this guidance  on february   we ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under this guidance  we had goodwill tested for impairment during the years  and  and no write downs from impairments were necessary 
our tests for impairment utilize discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair values of the individual assets 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are as follow i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trade mark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these tests factor in economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
for the years   and there was no impairment present for these long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted guidance under asc topic compensation stock compensation  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
under this guidance  using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  prior to the adoption of this guidance  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  the compensation cost for stock options had been measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we account for income taxes in accordance with guidance under asc topic income taxes 
under this guidance  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of this guidance  including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of our business 
based upon management assessment of all available evidence  including our completed transition into a licensing business  estimates of future profitability based on projected royalty revenues from our licensees  and the overall prospects of our business  management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized 
we adopted guidance under asc topic  beginning january   as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
the implementation of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the total unrecognized tax benefit was million at the date of adoption 
at december   the total unrecognized tax benefit was million 
however  this is not recognized for accounting purposes because the related deferred tax asset has been fully reserved in prior years 
we are continuing our practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there was no accrual for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended december  we file federal and state tax returns and we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal years prior to marketable securities  which are accounted for as available for sale  are stated at fair value in accordance with guidance under asc topic debt and equity securities  and consisted of auction rate securities 
temporary changes in fair market value are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss  whereas other than temporary markdowns have been realized through our statement of operations 
on january   we adopted guidance under asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurement 
while this guidance does not require any new fair value measurements in its application to other accounting pronouncements  it does emphasize that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
due to the bankruptcy of the insurer of the auction rate securities  which reduced the market value of its preferred securities to zero  we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities to be zero 
we believe this decrease in fair value is permanent due to the aforementioned bankruptcy 
the effect of the failure to auction since the third quarter of fiscal and the aforementioned bankruptcy has resulted in pre tax loss of million which is reflected in consolidated income statement as a loss on marketable securities 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by requiring the majority of our licenses to be denominated in us dollars 
our note receivable due from the purchasers of the canadian trademark for joe boxer is denominated in canadian dollars 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate from canadian dollars to us dollars of less than  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
certain other licenses are denominated in japanese yen 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate from japanese yen to us dollars of  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   we had approximately million in variable interest debt under our term loan facility 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we have purchased derivative financial instruments such as interest rate hedges to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
we invested in certain auction rate securities  herein referred to as ars 
beginning in the third quarter of and through the current quarter  our balance of ars failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders  and the insurer of the ars exercised its put option to replace the underlying securities of the ars with its preferred securities 
further  although the ars had paid cash dividends according to their stated terms  the payment of cash dividends ceased after july  and were only temporarily reinstated for the four week period from december  to january  the dividends would be resumed only if the board of directors of the insurer declared such cash dividends to be payable at a later date 
no further dividends were received 
in january  we commenced a lawsuit against the broker dealer of these ars alleging  among other things  fraud  and seeking full recovery of the million face value of the ars  as well as legal costs and punitive damages 
in november  the insurer filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
these funds will not be available to us unless we realize recovery through the bankruptcy process  settlement or legal judgment of the action brought against the broker dealer 
due to the bankruptcy of the insurer of the ars  which reduced the market value of its preferred securities to zero  we estimated the fair value of our ars to be zero 
we believe this cumulative decrease in fair value is permanent due to the aforementioned bankruptcy 
the cumulative effect of the failure to auction since the third quarter of fiscal has resulted in pre tax loss of million which is reflected in the consolidated income statement as a loss on marketable securities 
as described elsewhere in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in connection with the initial sale of our convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedges with affiliates of merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated and lehman brothers inc at such time  the hedging transactions were expected  but were not guaranteed  to eliminate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes 
concurrently  we entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
on september  and october   respectively  lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman holdings  and its subsidiary  lehman brothers otc derivatives inc  or lehman otc  filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york  herein referred to as the bankruptcy court 
on september   we filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court relating to the lehman otc convertible note hedges 
we had purchased of the convertible note hedges from lehman otc  or the lehman note hedges  and we had sold of the warrants to lehman otc 
lehman otc s obligations under the lehman note hedges are guaranteed by lehman holdings 
if the lehman note hedges are rejected or terminated in connection with the lehman otc bankruptcy  we would have a claim against lehman otc and lehman holdings  as guarantor  for the damages and or close out values resulting from any such rejection or termination 
while we intend to pursue any claim for damages and or close out values resulting from the rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges  at this point in the lehman bankruptcy cases it is not possible to determine with accuracy the ultimate recovery  if any  that we may realize on potential claims against lehman otc or lehman holdings  as guarantor  resulting from any rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges 
we also do not know whether lehman otc will assume or reject the lehman note hedges  and therefore cannot predict whether lehman otc intends to perform its obligations under the lehman note hedges 
as a result  if lehman otc does not perform such obligations and the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price as adjusted of the convertible notes  the effective conversion price of the convertible notes which is higher than the actual conversion price due to these hedges would be reduced and our existing stockholders may experience dilution at the time or times the convertible notes are converted 
the extent of any such dilution would depend  among other things  on the then prevailing market price of our common stock and the number of shares of common stock then outstanding  but we believe the impact will not be material and will not affect our income statement presentation 
we are not otherwise exposed to counterparty risk related to the lehman bankruptcies 
we currently believe  although there can be no assurance  that the bankruptcy filings and their potential impact on these entities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will continue to monitor the bankruptcy filings of lehman holdings and lehman otc 
moreover  in connection with the warrant transactions with the counterparties  to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants  the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock
