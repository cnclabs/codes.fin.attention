our business strategy is to capitalize on our ability to innovate and generate rapid revenue growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
our revenue growth strategy combined with anticipated improvements to our gross profit margins and increased leverage on our research and development  sales and marketing and distribution investments and general and administrative expenses is expected to enhance our operating margins and improve our profitability in the future 
in  we completed the acquisition of veeco metrology inc  a scanning probe microscopy and optical industrial metrology business  or the nano surfaces business  and certain assets and liabilities in varian inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry instruments business  laboratory gas chromatography instruments business  and gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry instruments business  or the chemical analysis business 
these businesses complement our existing atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry products and expand our offerings to industrial and applied markets 
these acquisitions also provide opportunities to supply our customers with equipment packages that have a broader range of applications and value 
in  we completed our acquisition of bruker biospin 
both bruker corporation and bruker biospin were majority owned by six affiliated shareholders prior to the acquisition 
as a result  the acquisition of bruker biospin was considered a combination of companies under common control and was accounted for at historical carrying values 
with the addition of bruker biospin  we enhanced our scientific instruments business and thus furthered our position as a leading supplier of life science and materials research systems 
the technologies of bruker biospin are particularly complementary to our accurate mass electrospray time of flight mass spectrometers and our single crystal diffraction x ray spectrometers 
the addition of bruker biospin created revenue synergies  improved our sales and service infrastructure and enhanced our distribution of scientific instruments in the americas  europe and asia

financial overview for the year ended december   our revenue increased by million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the comparable period in included in this change in revenue is a reduction of approximately million from the impact of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and other foreign currencies and an increase of approximately million attributable to our recent acquisitions 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange and our recent acquisitions  revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue  on an adjusted basis  is attributable to both the scientific instruments segment  which increased by million  or  and the energy supercon technologies segment  which increased by million  or 
revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in sales of all our core technologies  particularly in magnetic resonance  x ray and mass spectrometry 
revenue in the energy supercon technologies segment increased due to higher demand for low temperature superconducting wire 
the mix of products sold in the scientific instruments segment during reflects increased demand from academic  government and industrial customers 
we attribute the increase in sales of magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry products and spending by academic and government customers to our new product introductions over the last twelve to eighteen months and to stimulus packages implemented by governments of various countries  including the us  germany  japan and china 
the improvement in revenues from our industrial customers reflects an ongoing economic improvement in these end markets 
in general  the spending patterns of our industrial customers were negatively impacted by the global recession through the first half of in the second half of  as the global economy started to improve  we began to see indicators of improvement in the industrial markets 
we experienced an increase in demand from our industrial customers in and we remain optimistic that the industrial markets we serve will continue to improve 
additionally  while many 
table of contents european governments have announced their intentions to reduce overall spending  a number of our key european markets  including germany  france and the uk  have announced that research spending will remain stable  or grow in some cases 
based on the recent announcements from these governments and recent announcements from the european union  we believe that funding for the majority of our products and markets will remain stable  or grow  in most of our key european markets 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million  resulting in an operating margin of  compared to income from operations of million  resulting in an operating margin of  for the comparable period in included in income from operations are various charges to cost of revenue  amortization of intangible assets and other charges related primarily to our recent acquisitions 
excluding the effect of these charges  operating margins increased to in compared to in the increase in operating margin  on an adjusted basis  is primarily the result of the higher revenue described above and a corresponding improvement in our gross profit margins 
our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was  compared with for the comparable period in however  excluding the effect of our recent acquisitions  gross profit margins increased to in compared to in the increase in revenue also allowed us to leverage our selling  general and administrative costs and our research and development costs  which decreased to of revenue for the year ended december  compared with of revenue for the comparable period in higher gross profit margins in the year ended december  resulted primarily from higher revenues and changes in product mix  specifically an increase in revenues from high end instrumentation  including our newly introduced products which were designed to carry higher gross margins than our previous generations of products 
the increase in revenue also allowed us to better utilize our production facilities and leverage our fixed production costs 
the weakening of the euro  which favorably impacts our gross profit margins as a majority of our production is performed in europe  also contributed to the improvement in gross profit margin 
we incurred approximately million of interest expense during the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in of the total interest expense incurred during the year ended december   approximately million related to a credit facility that we entered into during the first quarter of in october we borrowed million under the revolving portion of the credit agreement to finance the acquisition and the working capital requirements of the nano surfaces business 
subsequent to the acquisition of the nano surfaces business we borrowed an additional million for general working capital requirements 
we are currently evaluating long term financing options to replace million borrowed under the revolving loan 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to in our tax rate can vary from year to year as the amount and mix of income and taxes outside of the us changes 
our tax rate also varies as a result of discrete items that are of a non recurring nature 
in  we increased our reserves for certain ongoing tax audits by million 
in  we repatriated cash from certain foreign locations into the us in order to reduce our outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
this repatriation  and certain other transactions that were taxable in the united states  resulted in approximately million of tax expense 
our net income attributable to the shareholders of bruker corporation for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the comparable period in 
table of contents critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets  warranty costs and derivative financial instruments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally are transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured  such as when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the relative fair value of the elements  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is typically determined by referencing the prices charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in an arrangement  but no such evidence for the delivered items  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
changes in our ability to establish the fair value for each element in multiple element arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we also have contracts for which we apply the percentage of completion model of revenue recognition 
application of the percentage of completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract 
changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
the determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the deductions  carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax 
table of contents jurisdiction  and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary 
in addition  we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits  tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain international subsidiaries 
we record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non saleable or non refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers 
we consider our demonstration units to be available for sale 
we reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value  taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months  expected demand  technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in additional charges to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill is impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method 
estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgments by management about the future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we also review finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets when indications of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale based on historical warranty rates and our assumptions of future warranty claims 
the warranty accrual is included as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
although our products undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 

table of contents derivative financial instruments 
all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense

our cost of revenue in includes charges of million representing the difference between the fair value and historical costs of inventories acquired with the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses 
excluding these charges our gross profit margin for was 
there were no similar charges in our cost of revenue for higher gross profit margins  on an adjusted basis  resulted from changes in product mix  specifically an increase in revenues from high end instrumentation  including our newly introduced products which were designed to carry higher gross margins than our previous generations of products  and the weakening of the euro  which favorably impacts our gross profit margins because a majority of our production is performed in europe 
the increase in revenue also allowed us to better utilize our production facilities and leverage our fixed production costs 
we also reduced production costs through various cost saving initiatives and strict cost control in our manufacturing facilities 

table of contents selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the comparable period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to increases in headcount from our acquisitions of the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses and increases in headcount to support planned revenue growth in our existing businesses

while product mix and initiatives designed to increase gross profits drove the increase in gross profit margins  the installation of the gigahertz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer in the fourth quarter of also contributed approximately to the year over year improvement in gross profit margin 
because of the high degree of risk associated with the gigahertz project  the majority of costs incurred in connection with this project were charged to research and development expense as incurred  rather than capitalized as inventory 
as a result  the sale carried gross profit margins that were significantly higher than those of our other nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the comparable period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to increases in headcount in support of planned revenue growth and as a result of certain acquisitions 
increases in sales and marketing expenses were offset  in part  by various cost saving initiatives 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the weakening of the euro  also offset cost increases because the majority of our selling and marketing employees are located in europe 
research and development our research and development expense for the year ended december  decreased to million  or of product and service revenue  from million  or of product and service revenue  for the comparable period in the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the weakening of the euro  as a majority of our research and development is performed in europe 
cost saving initiatives in certain areas of our research and development organization also contributed to the decrease 
however  we also continued to make incremental investments in research and development that we believe will generate future growth

other charges  net other charges  net of million recorded in consist of million of charges recorded in the scientific instruments segment and million of charges recorded in the energy supercon technologies segment 
the charge recorded in the scientific instruments segment consists entirely of restructuring charges and relates to additional amounts recorded in connection with a restructuring program that began in the fourth quarter of  under which approximately employees located in the netherlands left the company 
the charges recorded in the energy supercon technologies segment consist of million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the research instruments business from varian medical systems  inc and million of impairment charges associated with fixed assets used in the production of certain superconducting wire offset  in part  by a bargain purchase gain of million recorded in connection with the acquisition of the research instruments business 
other charges  net of million recorded in related entirely to the scientific instruments segment 
the charges consist of million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the bruker biospin and million of restructuring charges 
transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of bruker biospin were expensed because the acquisition represented a combination of companies under common control due to a majority of ownership of both bruker corporation and bruker biospin by the same individuals 
the restructuring charges incurred related primarily to an involuntary severance program affecting employees in the netherlands 
the actions taken in the netherlands reduced the number of employees in sales and marketing and research and development and consolidated and focused the selling and development efforts of our single crystal x ray diffraction products

during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  were realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of million and net interest expense of million 
the losses on foreign currency transactions in resulted from the re measurement of certain foreign currency denominated assets  principally cash  inter company receivables and a short term inter company loan into the functional currency of the affected entities 
we implemented various programs to reduce our exposure from re measurement of foreign currencies 
these programs contributed to the decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions

discrete items impacting the provision for income taxes in included tax benefits of million and related primarily to reversing certain valuation allowances and reaching the more likely than not threshold for recognizing certain tax receivables 
the tax benefits described were offset by million of income taxes incurred in connection with the liquidation of a tax ineffective entity within the scientific instruments segment 
in addition  acquisition related costs did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they were incurred primarily in the us and our foreign currency exchange losses did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they occurred in foreign locations with relatively low statutory tax rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we currently anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months  but this depends on our profitability and our ability to manage working capital requirements 
our future cash requirements will also be affected by acquisitions that we may make in the future 
historically  we have financed our growth through cash flow generation and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock 
in the future  there are no assurances that additional financing alternatives will be available to us if required  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us

the outstanding principal under the term loan is payable in quarterly installments through december borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at either i the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or ii adjusted libor  plus margins ranging from to and a facility fee ranging from to 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the term facility of the credit agreement was approximately 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the pledge to the banks of of the capital stock of each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of certain of our wholly owned direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial ratios related to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage  as 
table of contents defined in the credit agreement 
specifically  our leverage ratio cannot exceed and our interest coverage ratio cannot be less than in addition to the financial ratios  the credit agreement restricts  among other things  our ability to do the following make certain payments  incur additional debt  incur certain liens  make certain investments  including derivative agreements  merge  consolidate  sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 
as of december   the latest measurement date  we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement as our leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was other revolving loans are with various financial institutions located primarily in germany  switzerland and france

 software revenue recognition 
in addition  hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the software revenue guidance 
fasb asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the eitf reached consensus on fasb asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic no 
 revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  principally germany and other countries in the european union  switzerland and japan  which exposes our operations to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
in the years ended december  and our revenue by geography was as follows dollars in millions revenue percentage of revenue revenue percentage of revenue united states europe asia pacific rest of world total revenue changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenue by approximately in each of the years ended december  and assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is the local currency  are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded net gains from currency translation adjustments of million and million  respectively 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
our foreign exchange losses  net were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
from time to time  we have entered into foreign currency contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in exchange rates have on our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
under these arrangements  we agree to purchase a fixed amount of a foreign currency in exchange for a fixed amount of us dollars or other currencies on specified dates typically with maturities of less than twelve months 
these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  the instrument is recorded at fair value with the corresponding gains and losses recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents at december  and  we had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had the following notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts in millions buy notional amount in buy currency sell maturity notional amount in us dollars fair value of assets fair value of liabilities december  euro australian dollars january euro swiss francs january euro us dollars january to december euro us dollars january to may swiss francs us dollars january swiss francs euro january us dollars euro january us dollars euro january based on the contractual maturities of these contracts and exchange rates as of december   we anticipate that these contracts will result in net cash flows of million in and million in at december   assuming all other variables are constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would increase by approximately million and if the us dollar strengthened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would decrease by approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and in the future may utilize foreign currency contracts more frequently as part of a transactional hedging program 
impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in short term investments that are subject to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal because of our policy of investing in short term financial instruments issued by highly rated financial institutions 
our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective we have entered into an interest rate swap 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in interest expense because we have determined that the interest rate swap is an effective hedge of the variability of cash flows of the interest payments 
under our interest rate swap arrangement we pay a fixed interest rate of approximately and receive a variable interest rate based on three month libor through december  the initial notional amount of this interest swap was million and amortizes in proportion to the term debt component of our credit agreement 
at december  and december   the outstanding notional amount of this swap was million and million  respectively 
based on interest rates as of december   the fair value of the swap was million and we anticipate that the interest rate swap will result in net cash flows of million in and million in impact of commodity prices we are exposed to certain commodity risks associated with prices for various raw materials 
the prices of copper and certain other raw materials  particularly niobium  used to manufacture superconductors have increased significantly over the last decade 
copper and niobium tin are the main 
table of contents components of low temperature superconductors and continued commodity price increases for copper and niobium as well as other raw materials may negatively affect our profitability 
periodically  we enter into commodity forward purchase contracts to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in the price of copper have on our sales of these commodities 
at december  and december   we had fixed price commodity contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate our commodity risks and may utilize commodity forward purchase contracts more frequently in the future 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
