overview we are a fortune corporation and a leading business process services company  servicing resellers  retailers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in multiple regions around the world 
our primary business process services are distribution and business process outsourcing  or bpo 
we operate in two segments distribution services and global business services  or gbs 
our distribution services segment distributes it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  consumer electronics  or ce  and complementary products 
we also provide contract assembly services within our distribution segment 
our gbs segment offers a range of bpo services to our customers that include customer management  renewal management  back office processing and information technology outsourcing  or ito  on a global platform 
to further enhance our bpo solutions  we provide value added support services such as demand generation  pre sales support  product marketing  print and fulfillment  back office outsourcing and post sales technical support 
we combine our core strengths in distribution with our bpo services to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market  cost minimization  real time linkages in the supply chain and aftermarket product support 
we distribute more than  technology products as measured by skus from more than it  ce and oem suppliers to more than  resellers  system integrators  and retailers throughout the united states  canada and mexico 
our gbs segment provides outsourced services to customers in multiple  geographic locations and in multiple languages 
as of november   we had over  full time and temporary employees in both segments worldwide 
from a geographic perspective  approximately of our total revenue was from north america for each of the fiscal years ended november   and we purchase it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  ce and complementary products from our primary suppliers such as hewlett packard company  or hp  acer  panasonic  
table of contents lenovo and seagate and sell them to our reseller and retail customers 
we perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products 
our reseller customers include vars  corporate resellers  government resellers  system integrators  direct marketers  and national and regional retailers 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  ce  contract assembly services and bpo 
for products  we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
we review and adjust these provisions periodically 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we provide our bpo services in our gbs segment to customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
our agreements are usually short term in nature  subject to early termination by our customers or us for any reason  typically with to days notice 
revenue is recognized as services are performed and if collection is reasonably assured 
in fiscal year  one customer accounted for of our total revenue 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal years or approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products and services 
the market for it products and services is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our overall business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
in our distribution segment  we are highly dependent on the end market demand for it and ce products and services 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it and ce products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it and ce products  overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it and ce industries and increased price based competition 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of product distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory  and royalties due to oem vendors 
in addition  cost of revenue includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead for our contract assembly and gbs services 
margins the distribution and contract assembly services industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated annually due to changes in the mix of products and services we offer  customers we sell to  incentives and rebates received from our oem suppliers  competition  seasonality and replacement of less profitable business with investments in higher margin  more 
table of contents profitable lines and lower costs associated with increased efficiencies 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin from continuing operations has also fluctuated annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution  contract assembly and bpo revenue  and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
in addition  beginning in the first fiscal quarter of  we recognized revenue on certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts  where we are not a primary obligor  on a net basis  which favorably impacted our gross and operating margins 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we seek to augment our services offering expansion with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our global bpo capabilities 
we also divest businesses that we deem no longer strategic to our ongoing operations 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new reseller and retail customers  oem suppliers  and product lines  have extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly in targeted markets  and have diversified and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and include acquired entities within our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition

million 
economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
the gbs industry is also extremely competitive 
the customers performance measures are based on competitive pricing terms and quality of services 
accordingly  we could be subject to pricing pressure and may experience a decline in our average selling prices for our services 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it and ce products industries 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
in addition  with the addition of new age electronics in and jack of all games in  which have higher concentrations of ce sales  we expect our fourth quarter seasonal spike may be larger 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on uninvested amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
the participant may designate one or more investments as the measure of investment return on the participant s account 
the equity securities are either classified as trading securities or cost securities 
generally  the gains losses on the deferred compensation securities are recorded in other income expense  net and an equal amount is charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
for the deferred compensation investments  we recorded a gain of million  a gain of million and a loss of million  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to 
table of contents be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue as hardware and software products are shipped and as services are performed  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we recognize revenue on certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts  where we are not a primary obligor  on a net basis beginning in the first fiscal quarter of approximately of revenue was recorded on a net basis for the fiscal year ended november  our mexico operation primarily focuses on projects with the mexican government and other local agencies that are long term in nature 
under the agreements  the payments are due on a monthly basis and are contingent upon performing certain services and meeting certain conditions 
we recognize product revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we provide our bpo services to our customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
these agreements are usually short term in nature and subject to early termination by the customers or us for any reason  typically with to days notice 
typically the contracts are time based or transactions based 
revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract if the service has already been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for outstanding balances 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the accounts receivable  credit evaluations of customers financial condition and existence of credit insurance 
we also evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and value and adequacy of collateral received from customers 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  oem suppliers may seek to change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have 
table of contents excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis during our fourth quarter  regardless if there is evidence or suspicion of impairment 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause impairment  include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
no impairment loss was recorded for the periods presented 
in accordance with asc  intangible goodwill and other  a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
for the purpose of goodwill analysis  we have two reporting units  as defined by asc  intangible goodwill and other 
our distribution services business segment is comprised of one distribution services reporting unit and the gbs business segment is comprised of one contact center reporting unit 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge for the fiscal years ended  or determining the fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or a long lived asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
in the fiscal year ended november   we recorded an impairment of million on our long lived assets 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes  as well as 
table of contents estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes in excess of amounts that are ultimately considered more likely than not realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates

table of contents in our distribution business  we sell in excess of  technology products as measured by active skus from more than it  ce and oem suppliers to more than  resellers 
the prices of our products are highly dependent on the volumes purchased within a product category 
the products we sell from one period to the next are often not comparable because of rapid changes in product models and features 
the revenue generated in our gbs segment relates to bpo services such as demand generation  pre sales support  product marketing  print and fulfillment  back office support  ito  renewal management and post sales technical support 
the inter segment eliminations relate to the inter segment back office support services provided by our gbs segment to our distribution segment 
gbs revenue to third parties is net of inter segment eliminations 
the gbs programs and customer service requirements change frequently from one period to the next and are often not comparable 
our revenue in the distribution segment increased year over year because of the improvement in overall market conditions in both the us and canada following the economic recession in fiscal year which had impacted our channel sales volumes 
our sales also benefitted from our acquisition of jack of all games  inc  new vendors and sales initiatives 
by product line  in comparison to fiscal year  our networking product sales increased  system component sales increased  systems sales increased and peripheral sales increased 
our revenue from software sales benefitted from the sales of gaming products but decreased by as compared to the prior year period because of the presentation of revenue generated from certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts on a net basis beginning in fiscal first quarter of see note revenue recognition 
revenue also benefitted from the foreign exchange translation of our canadian operations as compared to the prior year 
in fiscal year  revenue in the gbs segment increased as compared to the prior year because of revenue from new customers and increased call volumes in our bpo service contact centers 
our decrease in distribution revenue for the fiscal year ended november  from the fiscal year ended november  was primarily attributable to the slow economic environment which had caused a to decline in overall channel volumes 
revenue was also adversely impacted by the foreign exchange translation of our canadian distribution operations 
these declines were offset by market share gains and the full year impact of the new age electronics acquisition 
our increase in gbs revenue for the fiscal year ended november  from the fiscal year ended november  was mainly due to increased business  higher call volumes in our contact centers and additional revenue generated from our smaller acquisitions 
gross profit fiscal years ended november  percent change to to in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  average selling prices  the variety of products and services we sell  the customers to whom we sell  our sources of revenue by segments  rebate and discount programs from our suppliers  freight costs  reserves for inventory losses  acquisitions and divestitures of business units  fluctuations in revenue  and our mix of business including our gbs services 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year increased by basis points over fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year was approximately basis points higher as a result of accounting for certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts on a net basis in fiscal year our gross profit was impacted by the sale of inventory and customer contracts to mitac international  our acquisitions and changes in our mix of business 

table of contents our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by basis points in fiscal year over primarily due to net changes in our product mix  expansion of our gbs services  greater success in maximizing our variable incentives and pricing policies  and continued focus on costs and freight management 
no specific customers  or changes in pricing strategy  individually or in the aggregate  contributed significantly to the change in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal years ended november  percent change to to in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue approximately two thirds of our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs such as salaries  commissions  bonuses  share based compensation  deferred compensation expense or income  and temporary personnel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs of our facilities  utility expense  professional fees  depreciation expense on our capital equipment  bad debt expense  amortization expense on our intangible assets  and marketing expenses  offset in part by reimbursements from oem suppliers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year from fiscal year  due to higher headcount and increase in personnel costs of million and higher operating overhead costs of million 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in bad debt expense  a million decrease in intangible amortization costs and a million decrease in deferred compensation expenses 
the increase in our personnel costs and operating overhead is due to the growth of our business  investments in strategic initiatives and our recent acquisitions  including of jack of all games  inc our selling  general and administrative expenses were also adversely impacted by the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year from fiscal year  both on a dollar basis as well as percentage of revenue due to an increase in our deferred compensation cost accrual of million  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses  mainly due to the acquisitions  and leasehold improvements of million 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction of million for personnel and professional expenses and a reduction of million in overhead  travel and communication costs as a result of cost control efforts

our effective tax rate in both the fiscal years and was 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year benefitted from the release of certain tax reserves resulting from the conclusion of the internal revenue service  or irs  tax audits and the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
this was offset by the loss of tax holidays in a foreign location and the changes in the mix of income in the different tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal year as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the effective tax rate in fiscal year was slightly lower than in fiscal year  primarily due to higher profit contributions from lower tax jurisdictions as well as certain favorable permanent differences and an impact on deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows our business is working capital intensive 
our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we rely heavily on debt  accounts receivable flooring programs  our securitization program and our revolver program for our working capital needs 
we have financed our growth and cash needs to date primarily through working capital financing facilities  convertible debt  bank credit lines and cash generated from operations 
the primary uses of cash have been to fund working capital  for acquisitions and for the generation of increased sales

the impact as of november  was a million reduction in cash and a corresponding increase in short term investments

the covenants also limit our ability to pay cash upon conversion  redemption or repurchase of the notes  as defined below  subject to certain liquidity tests 
as of november   we were in compliance with all material covenants for the above arrangements 
convertible debt in may  we issued million of aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement 
the notes have a cash coupon interest rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  in addition  we will pay contingent interest in respect of any six month period from may to november or from november to may  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the trading price of the notes for each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the notes

in addition  holders may also convert their notes at their option at any time beginning on november   and ending at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the notes  without regard to the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  we will pay or deliver  as the case may be  cash  shares of the common stock or a combination thereof at our election 
the initial conversion rate for the notes will be shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest  including any additional interest and any contingent interest

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment with other senior unsecured debt and rank senior to subordinated notes  if any 
the notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the notes are also structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
the net proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes and to reduce outstanding balances under the us arrangement and the revolver 
the notes are governed by an indenture  dated as of may   between us and us bank national association  as trustee  which contains customary events of default 
the notes as hybrid instruments are accounted as convertible debt and are recorded at carrying value 
the right of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change and the contingent interest feature would require separate measurement from the notes  however  the amount is insignificant 
the additional shares issuable following certain corporate transactions do not require bifurcation and separate measurement from the notes 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted new standards effective december   that changed the accounting for the notes 
under the previous standards the notes were recognized entirely as a liability at historical value 
in accordance with the provisions of the new standards  we retrospectively recognized both a liability and an equity component of the notes in a manner that reflects our non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 
the value assigned to the debt component which is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar note without the conversion feature was determined to be million 
the difference between the note cash proceeds and this estimated fair value was estimated to be million and was retroactively recorded as a debt discount and will be amortized to interest expense and finance charges  net over the five year period to the first put date  utilizing the effective interest method 
the corresponding offset was recorded to additional paid in capital and was adjusted for deferred taxes of million 
underlying debt issuance costs of million associated with the notes were allocated between the liability and equity components of the debt in accordance with the provisions of the new standard 
as of november   the remaining amortization period is approximately months assuming the redemption of the debentures at the first purchase date of may  based on a cash coupon interest rate of  we recorded contractual interest expense of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
based on an effective rate of  we recorded non cash interest expense of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
as of both november  and  the carrying value of the equity component of the notes  net of allocated issuance costs  was million 
as of november   the if converted value of the notes did not exceed the principal balance 
related party transactions we have a business relationship with mitac international corporation  or mitac international  a publicly traded company in taiwan that began in when it became our primary investor through its affiliates 
as of november   mitac international and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
in addition  matthew miau  the chairman emeritus of our board of directors  is the chairman of mitac international and a director or officer of mitac international s affiliates 
as a result  
table of contents mitac international generally has significant influence over us and over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for consideration  including any of our mergers or acquisitions 
among other things  this could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control over us with the loss of any premium that stockholders otherwise might receive in connection with such a transaction 
until july   we worked with mitac international on oem outsourcing and jointly marketed mitac international s design and electronic manufacturing services and our contract assembly capabilities 
this relationship enabled us to build relationships with mitac international s customers

in fiscal year  oracle corporation acquired sun microsystems and all of our contract assembly services to oracle corporation were covered by this master supply agreement 
our business relationship with mitac international had been informal and was not governed by long term commitments or arrangements with respect to pricing terms  revenue or capacity commitments 
during the period of time that we worked with mitac international  we negotiated manufacturing  pricing and other material terms on a case by case basis with mitac international and our contract assembly customers for a given project 
while mitac international is a related party and a controlling stockholder  we believe that the significant terms under these agreements  including pricing  would not materially differ from the terms we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties  and we have adopted a policy requiring that material transactions with mitac international or its related parties be approved by our audit committee  which is composed solely of independent directors 
in addition  matthew miau s compensation is approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee  which is also composed solely of independent directors 
as mitac international s ownership interest in us decreases as a result of sales of our stock and additional dilution  its interest in the success of the business and operations may decrease as well
