item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mesa laboratories  inc manufactures and distributes electronic measurement systems and disposable products for various niche applications  including renal treatment  food processing  medical sterilization  pharmaceutical processing and other industrial applications 
our company follows a philosophy of manufacturing a high quality product and providing a high level of on going service for those products 
in order to optimize the performance of our company 
table of contents and to build the value of the company for its shareholders  we continually follow the trend of various key financial indicators 
a sample of some of the most important of these indicators is presented in the following table 
key financial indicators cash and investments trade receivables gross days sales outstanding inventory net inventory turns working capital current ratio total amortization and depreciations earnings before amortization  depreciation and income tax average return on stockholder investment assets invested capital net sales gross profit gross margin operating income operating margin net profit net profit margin earnings per diluted share capital expenditures net head count sales per employee average return on stockholder investment is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year total stockholder s equity 
average return on invested capital invested capital total assets current liabilities cash and short term investments is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year invested capital 
while we continually try to optimize the overall performance and trends  the table above does highlight various exceptions 
the indicators above show mixed results in the most recent fiscal year due to the impact of large increases in intangible assets as well as other assets through various acquisitions 
a decrease in net profit margin combined with increasing balance sheet levels during fiscal caused the average return on assets and invested capital calculations to decrease in the current fiscal year 
our company saw a decrease in net profit margin in fiscal due to a decrease in gross profit margins resulting from the expansion of the biological indicator segment which typically has a lower 
table of contents gross margin and lower gross margins for the torqo product lines as a result of high outside manufacturing costs for the first nine months of fiscal results of operations net sales net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal  and net sales for fiscal increased two percent from fiscal in dollars  net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in  and net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in our revenues come from two main sources which include product revenues and parts and service revenues 
parts and service revenues are derived from on going repair and recalibration or certification of our products 
the certification or recalibration of product is usually a key component of the customer s own quality system and many of our customers operate in regulated industries  such as food processing or medical and pharmaceutical processing 
for this reason  these revenues tend to be fairly stable and grow slowly over time 
also  it is important to note that the biological indicator products are disposables and thus do not contribute to the company s parts and service revenue 
during fiscal years  and our company had parts and service revenue of   and  as a percentage of total revenue  parts and service revenues were in  in and in the performance of new product sales is dependent on several factors  including general economic conditions in the united states and abroad  capital spending trends  competition and the introduction of new products 
new products released to the market over the past five fiscal years include the xl dialysate meter for kidney dialysis which was introduced late in fiscal  and the datatrace rf system which was introduced in early fiscal all biological indicator sales as well as the torqo line of products also contribute to product sales 
for fiscal years  and  product sales for our company were   and  due to the addition of sgm biotech earlier this fiscal year  the company is in the process of changing its reporting to better reflect its two distinct business segments  biological indicator products and instrumentation products 
the instrumentation products are based at the company s lakewood  co facility and produce quality control instruments for various overlapping industries  while biological indicator products are manufactured at our bozeman  mt and omaha  ne facilities and produce various disposables used to verify sterility 
this segmentation provides a clearer picture of how changes in our product mix impact net sales and profitability  especially at the gross profit level 
for the current fiscal year  biological indicator products have increased to  or percent from  in the prior year period  and instrumentation products have increased to  or percent from  in the prior year period 
for the current year the increase in biological indicator products is chiefly due to the addition of the sgm biotech products in late april of this year  the addition of the products purchased from apex laboratories  inc in december  and strong organic growth of ten percent for the current year for our existing biological indicator business 
during the current fiscal year  the increase in instrumentation products and services was eleven percent  and was due primarily to the addition of the torqo product line in december sales of existing instrumentation products remained flat versus fiscal with an increase of less than one percent 
the total increase in revenues during fiscal was due chiefly to the additions of torqo and sgm products which were acquired in december and april  respectively  and apex products in december for fiscal  torqo products contributed  and sgm biotech products contributed  to the total increase in sales for the year 
apex products contributed another  to fiscal results 
our other products contributed an additional  or a three percent increase to revenues for the year 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales in fiscal increased percentage points from fiscal to percent  and in fiscal increased percentage points from fiscal to percent from percent 
most of our products enjoy gross margins in excess of percent 
due to the fact that the dialysis products have sales concentrated with several companies that maintain large chains of treatment centers  the products that are sold to the renal market tend to be slightly more price sensitive than the data logging products 
also  due to the more competitive nature of the market for biological indicators  those products produce gross margins lower than the instrumentation products 
therefore  shifts in product mix toward higher sales of instrumentation products will tend to produce lower cost of sales expense and higher gross margins while shifts toward higher sales of biological indicator products will normally produce the opposite effect on cost of sales expense and gross margins 
during fiscal  our company saw small increases in cost of sales as a percent of sales 
this was due to the acquisition of sgm biotech  inc the acquisition of the torqo products also has had a negative effect on margins due to the use of vibrac  llc to manufacture these products for the first three quarters of fiscal manufacturing of the torqo products was consolidated at our lakewood  co facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we will expect to see cost of sales decline to less than percent as a percent of sales 
the acquisition of apex had a small positive effect on gross margins in fiscal the addition of apex and the move of torqo manufacturing should have a high positive impact on gross margins in fiscal selling  general and administrative to the greatest extent possible  we work at containing and minimizing general and administrative costs 
total administrative costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  which represents a  increase from fiscal to fiscal and a  increase from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  we saw a  increase in amortization expenses due to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the current year and in late fiscal salary and benefit increases resulting from acquisitions and an increase in company headcount from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal also contributed significantly to the overall increase in general and administrative costs in fiscal as we progress into fiscal  we expect to see most of these costs stabilize in total dollars spent and as a percent of net revenues  except amortization costs  which will increase due to the addition of apex late in fiscal the annual rates of amortization going into fiscal are  for the raven acquisition   for the torqo acquisition   for the sgm biotech acquisition  and  for the apex acquisition 
our selling and marketing costs tend to be far more variable in relation to sales  although there are various exceptions 
some of these exceptions include the introduction of new products and the mix of international sales to domestic sales 
for a product line experiencing introduction of a new product  costs will tend to be higher as a percent of sales due to higher advertising development and sales training programs 
our company s international sales are usually discounted and recorded at the net discounted price  so that a change in mix between international and domestic sales may influence selling and marketing costs 
one other major influence on selling and marketing costs is the mix of domestic dialysis product sales to all other domestic sales 
domestic dialysis product sales are made by direct telemarketing representatives  which gives us a lower cost structure  when compared to the field salesman and independent representative sales channels utilized by our other products 
through fiscal and fiscal the company continued to focus additional resources on its selling and marketing efforts 
in dollars  selling and marketing costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling cost were percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal during both fiscal and  selling and marketing costs as a percent of sales declined 
fiscal selling and marketing costs as a percent of sales declined due to a smaller level of increases in these costs versus the large increase in sales 
fiscal selling and marketing costs declined as a percent of sales due to cost savings initiatives implemented during the year 

table of contents research and development company sponsored research and development cost was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal most of the increase in fiscal was related to the biological indicator business activity and consulting costs for future instrumentation products product improvements 
we are currently executing a strategy of increasing the flow of internally developed products 
late in the first quarter of fiscal  the datatrace micropack rf product was introduced  and on going research to introduce this technology into the environmental monitoring segment of the market has proceeded during fiscal and biological indicator research has been increased significantly in fiscal with the addition of the sgm biotech operations 
work in the biological indicator business is to focus on products for new sterilization processes and on shorter sterility verification cycles 
net income net income increased to  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal from  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal  and fiscal decreased from  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal during fiscal profitability was impacted chiefly by a large increase in revenues through acquisitions offset somewhat by increases in cost of sales as a percent of sales  amortization expenses related to acquisitions  and interest expense related to the debt used for acquisitions 
for the fiscal year  mesa experienced a small net income decrease of four tenths of one percent  which was impacted chiefly by an increase in the cost of sales and a decrease in interest income offset by a decrease in sales and marketing costs and income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  in addition  we had other current assets totaling  and total current assets of  current liabilities of our company were  which resulted in a current ratio of for comparison purposes at march   we had cash and short term investments of  other current assets of  total current assets of  current liabilities of  and a current ratio of the acquisitions of sgm biotech  inc and the assets of apex laboratories  inc required the use of much of the company s cash reserves as well as the necessity of borrowing funds to complete these transactions 
this led to a decrease in fiscal in current assets and a significant increase in current liabilities which resulted in the sharp drop in the current ratio 
our company has made capital acquisitions during the fiscal year of  of this amount  approximately  was utilized to purchase the sgm biotech facility 
on april    the company completed the purchase of sgm biotech  inc located in bozeman  mt 
under the terms of this acquisition the company acquired all of the stock of sgm biotech for  a cash payment of  was made at closing with an additional  placed into a joint escrow account 
the  placed in escrow was paid to the sellers in  increments at three months  six months and one year following closing 
the purchase price was subject to a final working capital adjustment as defined in the stock purchase agreement  and the company paid an additional  in october after the completion of the acquisition  the company repaid  of loans owed to the shareholders of sgm biotech 
the company incurred approximately  in third party acquisition costs related to this transaction during the current fiscal year

the company incurred approximately  in third party acquisition costs related to this transaction during the current fiscal year 

table of contents we have instituted a program to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
under the plan  the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
shares purchased will be canceled and repurchases will be made with existing cash reserves 
we do not maintain a set policy for our buyback program 
most of our stock buybacks have occurred during periods when the price to earnings multiple has been near historical low points  or during times when selling activity in the stock is out of balance with buying demand 
due to the company s lower cash position and higher debt  the company has greatly restricted stock buy backs during fiscal and expects to continue this policy in fiscal during fiscal  the company paid regular quarterly dividends of 
per share of common stock during the first two quarters of the year and increased the quarterly dividend rate to 
per share of common stock during the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
total dividends paid during fiscal were 
per share of common stock 
for fiscal year  dividends totaled 
per common share of stock 
our company invests its surplus capital in various interest bearing instruments  including money market funds and short term treasuries 
all investments are fixed dollar investments with variable rates in order to minimize the risk of principal loss 
to finance acquisitions  the company entered into a credit facility consisting of a month reducing line of credit for  and maturing at april   which has a remaining principal balance of  at march   and a revolving line of credit for  of which  was utilized as of march  both of these lines are subject to a variable rate of interest and a rate floor  both of which are currently 
in december the bank agreed to suspend the regular payment of  which was due january  until maturity at april  this action allowed the company to complete the acquisition of apex laboratories  inc without further alteration of the credit facility 
the company does not guarantee the debt of any other entity 
the company has maintained a long history of surplus cash flow from operations 
this surplus cash flow has been used in the past to fund acquisitions and stock buybacks and is currently being partially utilized to fund our on going dividend and will be used to retire debt 
if interesting candidates come to our attention  we may choose to pursue new acquisitions 
contractual obligations at march  we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders for routine purchases of supplies and inventory  which would be payable in less than one year 
to help finance the acquisition of sgm biotech  inc  the company entered into two separate credit facilities which require remaining principal payments of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as part of the apex laboratories product line acquisition executed december   the company is obligated to make two holdback payments of  plus percent per annum interest to apex laboratories in june and december of forward looking statements all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this annual report regarding our company s financial position and operating and strategic initiatives and addressing industry developments are forward looking statements

you are advised to review the item a 
risk factors of this report for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of mesa laboratories  inc 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  research and development costs  valuation of inventory  valuation of long lived assets and stock based compensation 
these policies  and the company s procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition we sell our products directly through our sales force and through distributors and manufacturer s representatives 
revenue from direct sales of our product is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
revenue from ongoing product service and repair is fully recognized upon completion and shipment of serviced product 
accounts receivable at the time the accounts are originated  the company considers a reserve for doubtful accounts based on the creditworthiness of the customer 
the provision for uncollectible amounts is continually reviewed and adjusted to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover future losses 
the allowance is management s best estimate of uncollectible amounts and is determined based on historical performance that is tracked by the company on an ongoing basis 
the losses ultimately incurred could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance 
research development costs research and development activities consist primarily of new product development and continuing engineering on existing products 
costs related to research and development efforts on existing or potential products are expensed as incurred 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method fifo to determine cost 
the company s policy is to periodically evaluate the market value of the inventory and the stage of product life cycle  and record a reserve for any inventory considered slow moving or obsolete 
as of march  and  the company had recorded a reserve of  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the realizable value of long lived assets for potential impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated fair value is less than its carrying value 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
as of march   we evaluated our long lived assets for potential impairment 
based on our evaluation  no impairment charge was recognized 

table of contents stock based compensation the company records equity compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the company recognizes the expense on a straight line basis over the service period net of an estimated forfeiture rate  resulting in a compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any viable alternative would not produce a materially different result
