the license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi module  multiple user solution incorporating the full range of our products 
customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support maintenance agreement 
to meet those customers needs  we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting  custom programming  on site installation  system to system interfacing and extensive training 
we provide these services  frequently referred to as systems integration services  for an additional fee  normally under a separate contract based upon time and materials utilized

we also engage in third party software alliance programs with other software vendors

under one such program  dmi was designated a microsoft gold certified partner to provide integrated supply chain products for microsoft s dynamics gp and nav solutions 
licenses like many business application software firms  our software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products 
in consideration of the payment of license fees  we typically grant non exclusive  nontransferable  perpetual licenses  which are primarily business unit and user specific and geographically restricted 
our standard license agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software 
in these agreements  we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation

index to financial statements competition our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain  as well as the enterprise application market as a whole 
our existing competitors include large erp application software vendors such as sap  oracle and infor  each of which offers sophisticated erp solutions that currently  or may in the future  incorporate supply chain management modules  advanced planning and scheduling  warehouse management  transportation or collaboration software  vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market  including  but not limited to  vendors such as jda software and red prairie  other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of  supply chain management software  and internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments 
in addition  our logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors  including erp vendors that from time to time jointly market logility s products as a complement to their own systems 
to the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to logility s products  their significant installed customer base  long standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a competitive advantage over logility s products 
we also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative commerce and supply chain management software and introduce new products and technologies 
in addition  current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality  domain expertise  integration technologies  product suite integration  breadth of products and related services such as customer support  training and implementation services 
other factors important to customers and prospects include customer service and satisfaction ability to provide relevant customer references compliance with industry specific requirements and standards flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements ability to generate business benefits rapid payback and measurable return on investment vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation initial license price  cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence  longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices  payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations 
we may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive  integrated solutions  our list of referenceable customers  the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers  our substantial investment in product development  our deep domain expertise  the ease of use of our software products  our customer support and implementation services  our ability to deploy quickly  and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers 
proprietary rights and licenses our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally  copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by us against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have re licensed  and expect in the future to re license  certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products 
there can be no assurance that these third party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination of any such licenses or product offerings  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
further  any such delay  if it becomes extended  could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations

risk factors a variety of factors may affect our future results and the market price of our stock 
we have included certain forward looking statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k 
we may also make oral and written forward looking statements from time to time  in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and otherwise 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that we believe may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our company 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this form k 
we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may affect our business  and therefore the risks and uncertainties discussed below may not be the only ones you should consider 
the risks and uncertainties discussed below are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally 
furthermore  as we continue to operate our business  we may encounter risks of which we are not aware at this time 
these additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future  the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time 
risk factors related to our business our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased  in part as a result of the deterioration in the business climate within the united states and other geographic regions in which we operate 
we expect this intensity of competition to increase in the future 
our current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
any significant consolidation among erp or supply chain software companies could adversely affect our competitive position 
increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share 
each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other supply chain software vendors  including sap  oracle corporation  jda software group  sap ag  infor  inc  manhattan associates  lawson software inc and others 
some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients 
the erp software market has experienced significant consolidation 
this consolidation has included numerous mergers and acquisitions  including takeovers such as the oracle acquisitions of peoplesoft  retek  profitlogic  inc  commerce  siebel systems  inc and global logistics technologies  inc  sap ag s acquisitions of triversity  inc and khimetics 
inc  and jda software s acquisition of manugistics group and i technologies 
it is difficult to estimate what long term effect these acquisitions will have on our competitive environment 
we have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements encountered competitive situations where we suspect that large competitors  in order to encourage customers to purchase licenses of non retail specific applications and gain retail market share  have also offered to license at no charge certain retail software applications that compete with our solutions 
if competitors such as oracle and sap ag and other large private companies are willing to license their retail and or other applications at no charge  this may result in a more difficult competitive environment for our products 
in addition  we could face competition from large  multi industry technology companies that have historically not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully for customers against our current or future competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
also  some prospective buyers are reluctant to purchase applications that could have a short lifespan  as an acquisition could result in the application s life being abruptly cut short 
in addition  increased competition and consolidation in these markets is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and changes in market share  any one of which could adversely affect us 
if customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors  they may elect to purchase competing products from a larger vendor than us since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products 
furthermore  some of these larger vendors  such as oracle  may be capable of bundling their software with their database applications  which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications 
when we compete with these larger vendors for new customers  we believe that these larger businesses often attempt to use their size as a competitive advantage against us 
many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms 
furthermore  potential customers may consider outsourcing options  including application service providers  data center outsourcing and service bureaus  as alternatives to licensing our software products 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we also face competition from the corporate information technology departments of current or potential customers capable of internally developing solutions and we compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors  including internet on demand software vendors  single industry software vendors  merging enterprise resource optimization software vendors  human resource management software vendors  financial management software vendors  merchandising software vendors  services automation software vendors  and outsourced services providers 
as a result  the market for enterprise software applications has been and continues to be intensely competitive 
some competitors are increasingly aggressive with their pricing  payment terms and or issuance of contractual warranties  implementation terms or guarantees 
third party service companies may offer competing maintenance and implementation services to our customers and thereby reduce our opportunities to provide those services 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could negatively affect our operating results and market share 

table of contents 
index to financial statements disruptions in the financial and credit markets  continuing slow economic recovery  and other external influences in the us and global markets may reduce demand for our software and related services  which may negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software  professional services and maintenance 
regional and global changes in the economy and financial markets  such as the severe global economic downturn in followed by a slow and relatively weak recovery  have resulted in companies reducing their spending for technology projects generally and delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products and related services 
adverse conditions in credit markets  lagging consumer confidence and spending  the fluctuating cost of fuel and commodities and their effects on the us and global economies and markets are examples of negative factors that have delayed or canceled certain potential customer purchases 
furthermore  the uncertainty posed by the long term effects of conflicts in the middle east  terrorist activities  related uncertainties and risks  and other geopolitical issues may also adversely affect the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers 
weakness in european economies may adversely affect demand for our products and services  both directly and by adversely affecting business conditions that our customers face  as many of our us customers rely heavily on european sales 
there can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets or to weakened economies will sufficiently restore confidence  stabilize markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit 
we are a technology company selling technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services  in many cases exceeding  reductions in the capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions 
these economic and political conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our products and services or to renew existing post contract support agreements  or their ability to pay for our products and services after purchase 
future declines in demand for our products or services or a broadening or protracted extension of these conditions would have a significant negative impact on our revenues and operating results 
we are dependent upon key personnel  and need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas 
our future operating results depend significantly upon the continued service of a relatively small number of key senior management and technical personnel  including our chief executive officer  james c 
edenfield  and the chief executive officer of our logility subsidiary  j 
michael edenfield 
none of our key personnel are bound by long term employment agreements 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of james c 
edenfield or j 
michael edenfield  or one or more other key executives  could have an adverse effect on us 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  retain and motivate other highly qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  including sales and marketing representatives  qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development  and personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and provide other services 
the market for such individuals is competitive 
for example  it has been particularly difficult to attract and retain product development personnel experienced in object oriented development technologies 
given the critical roles of our sales  product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel would adversely affect us 
a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterizes the software industry 
it may be particularly difficult to retain or compete for skilled personnel against larger  better known software companies 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses 
we will continue to adjust the size and composition of our workforce to match the different product and geographic demand cycles 
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the failure to attract  train  retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and sales efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service 
in particular  the loss of sales personnel could lead to lost sales opportunities because it can take several months to hire and train replacement sales personnel 
if our competitors increase their use of non compete agreements  the pool of available sales and technical personnel may further narrow in certain areas  even if the non compete agreements ultimately prove to be unenforceable 
we may grant large numbers of stock options to attract and retain personnel  which could be highly dilutive to our shareholders 
the volatility or lack of positive performance of our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees 
the loss of key management and technical personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
we periodically have restructured our sales force  which can be disruptive 
we continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force 
in recent years  we have restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to factors such as product changes  geographical coverage and other internal considerations 
change in the structures of the sales force and sales force management can result in temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity that may affect revenues in one or more quarters 
future restructuring of our sales force could occur  and if so  we may again experience the adverse transition issues associated with such restructuring 
our growth is dependent upon the successful further development of our direct and indirect sales channels 
we believe that our future growth also will depend on developing and maintaining successful strategic relationships with systems integrators and other technology companies 
our strategy is to continue to increase the proportion of customers served through these indirect channels 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these indirect channels 
this investment could adversely affect our operating results if these efforts do not generate license and service revenue necessary to offset this investment 
also  our inability to partner with other technology companies and qualified systems integrators could adversely affect our results of operations 
because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels  increased indirect sales could reduce our average selling prices and result in lower gross margins 
in addition  sales of our products through indirect channels will reduce our consulting service revenues  as the third party systems integrators generally provide these services 
as indirect sales increase  our direct contact with our customer base will decrease  and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales  evaluating customer satisfaction and recognizing emerging customer requirements 
in addition  these systems integrators and third party software providers may develop  acquire or market products competitive with our products 
our strategy of marketing our products directly to customers and indirectly through systems integrators and other technology companies may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and  to the extent that different systems integrators target the same customers  systems integrators may also come into conflict with each other 
any channel conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on our relationships with systems integrators or harm our ability to attract new systems integrators 
we may be required to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into an agreement  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
we may have to delay recognizing license revenue for a significant period of time based on a variety of factors  including whether the license agreement relates to then unavailable software products  whether transactions include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or other undeliverable elements  whether the customer demands services that include significant modifications  customizations or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance  
table of contents 
index to financial statements whether the transaction involves acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition or if there are identified product related issues  such as known defects  and whether the transaction involves payment terms or fees that depend upon contingencies 
these factors and other specific accounting requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for software revenue recognition require that we have very precise terms in our license agreements to allow us to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
although we have a standard form of license agreement that we believe meets the criteria under gaap for current revenue recognition on delivered elements  we negotiate and revise these terms and conditions in many transactions 
therefore  it is possible that from time to time we may license our software or provide services with terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 
we are dependent upon the retail industry for a significant portion of our revenues 
historically  we have derived a significant percentage of our revenues from the license of software products and the sale of collaborative applications that address vertical market opportunities with manufacturers and wholesalers that supply retail customers 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns in our customers industries 
we believe the retail industry remains cautious in its level of investment in information technology during the current difficult economic cycle 
we remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions  consolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain markets  especially if such weak economic conditions or fear of additional terrorist attacks and wars persist for an extended period of time 
weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively affect our revenues  including potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs  elongation of our selling cycles  and reduction in the demand for our products 
as a result  it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close 
in addition  weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services 
any of these factors could adversely affect our business  our quarterly or annual operating results and our financial condition 
we have observed that the retail industry may be consolidating  and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographic regions that could negatively affect the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation has in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues and reduce the demand for our products  and may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may derive a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter from a limited number of large  non recurring license sales 
we expect to continue to experience from time to time large  individual license sales  which may cause significant variations in quarterly license fees 
we also believe that purchasing our products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of a customer s capital resources 
therefore  a downturn in any customer s business could result in order cancellations that could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and quarterly results 
moreover  continued uncertainty about general economic conditions could precipitate significant reductions in corporate spending for information technology  which could result in delays or cancellations of orders for our products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict quarterly revenue levels and operating results 
because license and implementation fees for our software products are substantial and the decision to purchase our products typically involves members of our customers senior management  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy 
accordingly  the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict  and the delay of an order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from individual software products and toward more costly integrated suites of software and services  our sales cycle may lengthen  which could increase the likelihood of delays and cause the effect of a delay to become more pronounced 
delays in sales could cause significant shortfalls in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
also  it is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenues from sales of our products because our existing and prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our products before licensing them 
the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from nine months to more than one year 
during the evaluation period  prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons  including reduced demand for enterprise software solutions  introduction of products by our competitors  lower prices offered by our competitors  changes in budgets and purchasing priorities  and reduced need to upgrade existing systems 
our existing and prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefits of our products 
this may also lead to delays in receiving customers orders 
we derive a significant portion of our services revenues from a small number of customers 
if these customers were to discontinue the usage of our services or delay their implementation our total revenues would be adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our services revenues  and total revenues  from a small number of customers using our services for product enhancement and other optional services 
if these customers were to discontinue or delay the usage of these services  or obtain these services from a competitor  our services revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected 
customers may delay or terminate implementation of our services due to budgetary constraints related to economic uncertainty  dissatisfaction with product quality  the difficulty of prioritizing numerous information technology projects  changes in business strategy  personnel or priorities  or for other reasons 
such customers may be less likely to invest in additional software in the future and to continue to pay for software maintenance 
since our business relies to a large extent upon sales to existing customers and since maintenance and services revenues are key elements of our revenue base  any reduction in these sales or these maintenance and services payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
services revenues carry lower gross margins than license revenues and an overall increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues could have an adverse impact on our business 
because our service revenues have lower gross margins than do our license revenues  an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by service revenues or a change in the mix between services that are provided by our employees versus services provided by third party consultants could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if our customers elect not to renew maintenance contracts after the initial maintenance period and the loss of those customers is not offset by new maintenance customers  our maintenance revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected 
upon the purchase of a software license  our customers typically enter into a maintenance contract with a term from approximately one to three years 
if  after this initial maintenance period  customers elect not to renew their maintenance contracts and we do not offset the loss of those customers with new maintenance customers as a result of new license fees  our maintenance revenues and total revenues would be adversely affected 
we may not be successful in convincing customers to migrate to current or future releases of our products  which may lead to reduced services and maintenance revenues and less future business from existing customers 
our customers may not be willing to incur the costs or invest the resources necessary to complete upgrades to current or future releases of our products 
this may lead to our loss of services and maintenance revenues and future business from customers that continue to operate prior versions of our products or choose to no longer use our products 
we may change our pricing practices  which could adversely affect operating margins or customer ordering patterns 
the intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce our prices 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other products or services  we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
for these and other reasons  in the future we may choose to make changes to our pricing practices 
for example  we may offer additional discounts to customers  increase or decrease the use of pricing that involves periodic fees based on the number of users of a product  or change maintenance pricing 
pricing changes could reduce margins or inhibit our ability to sell our products 
if accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change or companies we acquire have applied such standards differently than we do or have not applied them at all  our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices or we may incur the expense and risks associated with an audit or restatement of the acquired company s financial statements 
there are several accounting standards and interpretations covering revenue recognition for the software industry 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance 
we believe that we currently comply with these standards 
the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of these pronouncements with the objective of providing additional guidance on their application and with respect to potential interpretations 
these discussions and the issuance of new interpretations could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  which could change the timing of recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices which could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect our reported revenues and results of operations 
in addition  companies we acquire may have historically interpreted software revenue recognition rules differently than we do or may not have been subject to us gaap as a result of reporting under local gaap in a foreign country 
if we discover that companies we have acquired have interpreted and applied software revenue recognition rules differently than prescribed by us gaap  we could be required to devote significant management resources  and incur the expense associated with an audit  restatement or other examination of the acquired companies financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we depend on third party technology which  if it should become unavailable or if it contains defects  could result in increased costs or delays in the production and improvement of our products 
we license critical third party software products that we incorporate into our own software products 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms  invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software  or even remain in business 
further  due to the limited number of vendors of certain types of third party software  it may be difficult for us to replace such third party software if a vendor terminates our license of the software or our ability to license the software to customers 
if our relations with any of these third party software providers are impaired  and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software  our business could be harmed 
in addition  if the cost of licensing any of these third party software products significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
the use of open source software in our products may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property 
some of our products use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses 
open source software is typically freely accessible  usable and modifiable 
certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user s software 
in addition  certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost 
this can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms 
while we monitor the use of all open source software in our products  processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product or solution  such use could inadvertently occur 
additionally  if a third party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products and solutions  we could  under certain circumstances  be required to disclose the source code to our products and solutions 
this could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
our future growth depends upon our ability to develop and sustain relationships with complementary vendors to market and implement our software products  and failure to develop and sustain these relationships could have a material adverse affect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may be unable to retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products 
as a software company  we have been required to migrate our products and services from mainframe to customer server to web based environments 
in addition  we have been required to adapt our products to emerging standards for operating systems  databases and other technologies 
we will be unable to compete effectively if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities to correspond to these emerging environments and standards  develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs  or anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
a substantial portion of our research and development resources is devoted to product upgrades that address regulatory and support requirements 
only the remainder of our limited research and development resources is available for new products 
new products require significant development investment 
that investment is further constrained because of the added costs of developing new products that work with multiple operating systems or databases 
we face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products 
if we do not attract sufficient customer interest in those products  we will not realize a return on our investment and our operating results will be adversely affected 
our core products face competition from new or modified technologies that may render our existing technology less competitive or obsolete  reducing the demand for our products 
as a result  we must continually redesign our products to incorporate these new technologies and to adapt our software products to operate on  and comply with evolving industry standards for  hardware and software platforms 
maintaining and upgrading our products to operate on multiple hardware and database platforms reduces our resources for developing new products 
because of the increased costs of developing and supporting software products across multiple platforms  we may need to reduce the number of those platforms 
in addition  conflicting new technologies present us with difficult choices of which new technologies to adopt 
if we fail to anticipate the most popular platforms  fail to respond adequately to technological developments  or experience significant delays in product development or introduction  our business and operating results will be negatively impacted 
in addition  to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of such technologies may require us to make significant capital investments 
we may not be able to obtain capital for these purposes and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable products 
the loss of revenue and increased costs to us from such changing technologies would adversely affect our business and operating results 
if our products are not able to deliver quick  demonstrable value to our customers  our business could be seriously harmed 
enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide faster returns on their technology investments 
we must continue to improve our speed of implementation and the pace at which our products deliver value or our competitors may gain important strategic advantages over us 
if we cannot successfully respond to these market demands  or if our competitors respond more successfully than we do  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments  our license and services revenue could be adversely affected 
the markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements continuously evaluate new technologies and implement advanced technology into our products 
however  if in our product development efforts we fail to accurately address  in a timely manner  evolving industry standards  new technology advancements or important third party interfaces or product architectures  sales of our products and services will suffer 
market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
we can license our software products for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures 
there may be future or existing relational database platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace and that may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design 
in addition  the effort and expense of developing  testing  and maintaining software product lines will increase as more hardware platforms and operating systems achieve market acceptance within our target markets 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design 
if we do not achieve market acceptance of new user interfaces that we support  or adapt to popular new user interfaces that we do not support  our sales and revenue may be adversely affected 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect revenues and results of operations 
we currently do not compete in the software on demand or application service provider markets 
some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through hosted on demand services or application service providers who distribute enterprise software through a hosted subscription service 
we do not currently have our own on demand hosting program for our products and have had limited success with channel partners who serve as application service providers for customers 
if these alternative distribution models gain popularity  we may not be able to compete effectively in this environment 
our software products and product development are complex  which makes it increasingly difficult to innovate  extend our product offerings  and avoid costs related to correction of program errors 
the market for our software products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
for instance  existing products can become obsolete and unmarketable when vendors introduce products utilizing new technologies or new industry standards emerge 
as a result  it is difficult for us to estimate the life cycles of our software products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to the market in a timely and cost effective manner  or that products  capabilities or technologies developed by our competitors will not render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance and expand our core applications  continue to sell our products  continue to successfully integrate third party products  enter new markets and achieve market acceptance  and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  including developments related to the internet  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
despite testing by us  our software programs  like all software programs generally  may contain a number of undetected errors or bugs when we first introduce them or as we release new versions 
we do not discover some errors until we have installed the product and our customers have used it 
errors may result in the delay or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements loss of revenues  diversion of software engineering resources  material non monetary concessions  negative media attention  or increased service or warranty costs as a result of performance or warranty claims that could lead to customer dissatisfaction  resulting in litigation  damage to our reputation  and impaired demand for our products 
correcting bugs may result in increased costs and reduced acceptance of our software products in the marketplace 
further  such errors could subject us to claims from our customers for significant damages  and we cannot assure you that courts would enforce the provisions in our customer agreements that limit our liability for damages 
the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining software product lines will increase with the increasing number of possible combinations of vendor hardware platforms  operating systems and updated versions  application software products and updated versions  and database management system platforms and updated versions 
developing consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our development resources and software product release schedules 
if the open source community expands into enterprise application and supply chain software  our license fee revenues may decline 
the open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use  distribution and modification  often free of charge 
open source software  such as the linux operating system  has been gaining in popularity among business users 
if developers contribute enterprise and supply chain application software to the open source community  and that software has competitive features and scale to support business users in our markets  we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete successfully 
implementation of our products can be complex  time consuming and expensive  customers may be unable to implement our products successfully  and we may become subject to warranty or product liability claims  which could be costly to resolve and result in negative publicity 
our products must integrate with the many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers 
this can be complex  time consuming and expensive  and may cause delays in the deployment of our products 
our customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
although we test each of our new products and product enhancement releases and evaluate and test the products we obtain through acquisitions before introducing them to the market  there may still be significant errors in existing or future releases of our software products  with the possible result that we may be required to expend significant resources in order to correct such errors or otherwise satisfy customer demands 
in addition  defects in our products or difficulty integrating our products with our customers systems could result in delayed or lost revenues  warranty or other claims against us by customers or third parties  adverse customer reactions and negative publicity about us or our products and services or reduced acceptance of our products and services in the marketplace  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to maintain our margins and service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from implementation services 
if we fail to scope our implementation projects correctly  our services margins may suffer 
we bill for implementation services predominately on an hourly or daily basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts  and we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements generally recognize revenue from those services as we perform the work 
if we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services  without corresponding cost reductions  or if the percentage of fixed price contracts increases and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts  our operating performance may suffer 
the rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors  including the following perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services  complexity of services performed  competition  pricing policies of our competitors and of systems integrators  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry  and economic  political and market conditions 
an increase in sales of software products that require customization would result in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract for those products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
historically  we generally have been able to recognize software license revenue upon delivery of our solutions and contract execution 
customers and prospects could ask for unique capabilities in addition to our core capabilities to give them a competitive edge in the market place 
these instances could cause us to recognize more of our software license revenue on a contract accounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution 
the period between the initial contract and the completion of the implementation of our products can be lengthy and is subject to a number of factors over many of which we have little or no control that may cause significant delays 
these factors include the size and complexity of the overall project 
as a result  a shift toward a higher proportion of software license contracts requiring contract accounting would have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we sometimes experience delays in product releases  which can adversely affect our business 
historically  we have issued significant new releases of our software products periodically  with minor interim releases issued more frequently 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our software  major new product enhancements and new products often require long development and testing periods before they are released 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in the scheduled release dates of new or enhanced products  and we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve future scheduled release dates 
the delay of product releases or enhancements  or the failure of such products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance  could materially affect our business and reputation 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years 
developing and localizing software is expensive  and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle 
our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years  if at all 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our past and future acquisitions may not be successful and we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we have in the past acquired and invested  and may continue to acquire or invest  in complementary companies  products and technologies  and enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
acquisitions  joint ventures  strategic alliances  and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the risk that the acquired company or assets may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the company or assets were worth  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and retaining and motivating personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate  dilution of existing equity holders caused by capital stock issuance to the shareholders of acquired companies or stock option grants to retain employees of the acquired companies  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies  potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers  potential assumption of liabilities of our acquisition targets  significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful  and issues with product quality  product architecture  legal contingencies  product development issues  or other significant issues that may not be detected through our due diligence process 
accounting rules require the use of the purchase method of accounting in all new business acquisitions 
many acquisition candidates have significant intangible assets  and an acquisition of these businesses would likely result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations may require large write offs of any in process research and development costs related to companies being acquired  as well as ongoing amortization costs for other intangible assets valued in combinations of companies 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized to income  but are subject to at least annual impairment reviews 
if the acquisitions do not perform as planned  future write offs and charges to income arising from such impairment reviews could be significant 
in addition  these acquisitions could involve acquisition related charges  such as one time acquired research and development charges 
such write offs and ongoing amortization charges may have a significant negative impact on operating margins and net earnings in the quarter of the combination and for several subsequent years 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such transactions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be affected by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale 
during weak economic conditions there is an increased risk that some of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in some of these instances be large  due to extended payment terms for software license fees and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  as the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business may require additional capital 
we may require additional capital to finance our growth or to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
our capital requirements may be influenced by many factors  including the demand for our products  the timing and extent of our investment in new technology  the timing and extent of our acquisition of other companies  the level and timing of revenue  the expenses of sales and marketing and new product development  the success and related expense of increasing our brand awareness  the cost of facilities to accommodate a growing workforce  the extent to which competitors are successful in developing new products and increasing their market shares  and the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights 
to the extent that our resources are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
however  additional funding  if needed  may not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
our inability to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our company by our current shareholders would be diluted 
business disruptions could affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to risks associated with unexpected activities outside of the united states 
the global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in locations within the united states 
as we grow our international operations  we may need to recruit and hire new consulting  product development  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which we have or will establish offices 
entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels  as well as the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software 
international introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
in addition  the opening of a new office typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
if we are less successful in a new market than we expect  we may not be able to realize an adequate return on our initial investment and our operating results could suffer 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel or that we can expand or contract our international operations in a timely  cost effective manner 
if we have to downsize certain international operations  particularly in europe  the costs to do so are typically much higher than downsizing costs in the united states 
the following factors  among others  could have an adverse impact on our business and earnings failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including  without limitation  software localization requirements  failure to properly comply with us laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations in europe  asia and north america  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties and other trade barriers  as well as health and safety requirements  difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing  longer collection cycles  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  particularly throughout europe  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences  anti american sentiment due to conflicts in the middle east and other american policies that may be unpopular in certain countries  increasing political instability  adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries  difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate  potential labor strikes  lockouts  work slowdowns and work stoppages at us and international ports  and restrictions on downsizing operations in europe and expenses and delays associated with any such activities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements changes in the value of the us dollar  as compared to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating results 
to date  our international revenues have been denominated primarily in us dollars 
however  the majority of our international expenses  including the wages of some of our employees  have been denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
we have implemented limited hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable  cash balances and intercompany accounts  but we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenues and expenses and other commitments 
for the foregoing reasons  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and likely will continue to cause  variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance 
our products are often critical to the operations of our customers businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
if our products fail to function as required  we may be subject to claims for substantial damages 
courts may not enforce provisions in our contracts that would limit our liability or otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
although we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover claims against us 
in addition  our insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
if claims exceeding the available insurance coverage are successfully asserted against us  or our insurer imposes premium increases  large deductibles or co insurance requirements on us  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities  including those relating to the unexpected failure of our products 
in the current market  insurance coverage for all types of risk is becoming more restrictive  and when insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger 
in light of these circumstances  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels or  if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have limited protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights and may potentially infringe third party intellectual property rights 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation to be proprietary  and rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in our license agreements with consultants  vendors  partners and customers and other measures to protect this information 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
we believe that the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factors such as knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements  customer education  and timeliness and quality of support services 
our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be licensed do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  consultants  and vendors 
these agreements control access to and distribution of our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products  obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  or develop similar technology through reverse engineering or other means 
preventing or detecting unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our license agreements will be enforceable 
in addition  we may resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of others proprietary rights  or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity in the future 
such litigation could result in significant costs or the diversion of resources 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
although we do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert or prosecute infringement or invalidity claims against us 
these assertions could distract management  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  and result in costly and time consuming litigation  including damage awards 
such assertions or the defense of such claims may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
in addition  such assertions could result in injunctions against us 
injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if third parties assert such claims against us  we may seek to obtain a license to use such intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if a patent claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  we may be prevented from distributing our software or required to incur significant expense and delay in developing non infringing software 
we may experience liability claims arising out of the licensing of our software and provision of services 
our agreements normally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims and generally exclude consequential and other forms of extraordinary damages 
however  these provisions could be rendered ineffective  invalid or unenforceable by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal  state  local or foreign laws or ordinances 
for example  we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance or the provision of services 
if a claim against us were to be successful  we may be required to incur significant expense and pay substantial damages  including consequential or punitive damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
even if we prevail in contesting such a claim  the accompanying publicity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
we also rely on certain technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software 
although these third parties generally indemnify us against claims that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others  such indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property 
often such third party indemnifiers are not well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event that their technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others 
as a result  we may face substantial exposure if technology we license from a third party infringes on another party s proprietary rights 
defending such infringement claims  regardless of their validity  could result in significant cost and diversion of resources 
adverse litigation results could affect our business 
we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims involving customer  shareholder  consumer  competition and other issues on a global basis 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive and disruptive to our operations  and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
an adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements concerns that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of consumers could inhibit sales of our products 
one of the features of our software applications is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of customers for use by businesses 
typically  these products capture profile information when customers and employees visit an internet web site and volunteer information in response to survey questions concerning their backgrounds  interests and preferences 
our products augment these profiles over time by collecting usage data 
although we have designed our products to operate with applications that protect user privacy  privacy concerns may nevertheless cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability 
if we cannot adequately address customers privacy concerns  these concerns could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we face risks associated with the security of our products 
maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for our customers 
attempts by experienced computer programmers  or hackers  to penetrate client network security or the security of web sites to misappropriate confidential information have become an industry wide phenomenon that affects computers and networks across all platforms 
we have included security features in certain of our internet browser enabled products that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data 
in addition  some of our software applications use encryption technology to provide the security necessary to effect the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information 
despite these security features  our products may be vulnerable to break ins and similar problems caused by internet users  which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of our customers 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or the internet in general could lead some customers to seek to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitors products which are not internet based applications 
customers may also increase their spending to protect their computer networks from attack  which could delay adoption of new technologies 
any of these actions by customers and the cost of addressing such security problems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
although our license agreements with our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure as a result of the situations listed above  such provisions may not be effective 
existing or future federal  state  or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions could affect their enforceability 
to date  we have not experienced any such product liability claims  but there can be no assurance that this will not occur in the future 
because our products are used in essential business applications  a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
additionally  defending such a suit  regardless of its merits  could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management 
growth in our operations could increase demands on our managerial and operational resources 
if the scope of our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers increase dramatically  this may increase demands on our management and operations 
our officers and other key employees will need to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
further  we may be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
we may not be able to manage future expansion successfully  and our inability to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies 
table of contents 
index to financial statements whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq  have issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent public accounting firm s audit of our internal control over financial reporting have required  and continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
moreover  because these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
over time  we have made significant changes in  and may consider making additional changes to  our internal controls  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure of our controls  policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
if in the future we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of the then current fiscal year or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could lead to a negative stock market reaction 
risks related to our stock price we could experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results that could adversely affect our stock price 
we have difficulty predicting our actual quarterly operating results  which have varied widely in the past and which we expect to continue to vary in the future 
we expect they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
we base our expense levels  operating costs and hiring plans on projections of future revenues  and it is difficult for us to rapidly adjust when actual results do not match our projections 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
license revenues in any quarter depend substantially on the combined contracting activity of the american software group of companies and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
our contracting activity is difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons  including the following we complete a significant portion of our license agreements within the last few weeks of each quarter  our sales cycle for products and services  including multiple levels of authorization required by some customers  is relatively long and variable because of the complex and mission critical nature of our products  the demand for our products and services can vary significantly  the size of our license transactions can vary significantly  the possibility of adverse global political conditions and economic downturns  both domestic and international  characterized by decreased product demand  price erosion  technological shifts  work slowdowns and layoffs  may substantially reduce customer demand and contracting activity  
table of contents 
index to financial statements customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system evaluation and implementation due to changes in their strategic priorities  project objectives  budgetary constraints  internal purchasing processes or company management  customer evaluations and purchasing processes vary from company to company  and a customer s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time consuming  even after selection of a vendor  and the number  timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and by our competitors may affect purchase decisions 
variances or slowdowns in our licensing activity in prior quarters may affect current and future consulting  training and maintenance revenues  since these revenues typically follow license fee revenues 
our ability to maintain or increase services revenues primarily depends on our ability to increase the number and size of our licensing agreements 
in addition  we base our budgeted operating costs and hiring plans primarily on our projections of future revenues 
because most of our expense levels are relatively fixed  including employee compensation and rent in the near term  if our actual revenues fall below projections in any particular quarter  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue increases 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
as a result  predictions of our future performance should not be based solely on our historical quarterly revenue and operating results 
our stock price is volatile and there is a risk of litigation 
the trading price of our common stock has been in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following general market conditions  revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations  published or otherwise  of the investment community  customer order deferrals resulting from the anticipation of new products  economic uncertainty  disappointing operating results by the customer  management changes  corporate reorganizations or otherwise  reduced investor confidence in equity markets  due in part to corporate collapses in recent years  speculation in the press or analyst community  wide fluctuations in stock prices  particularly with respect to the stock prices for other technology companies  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new products or the acquisition of significant customers by us or our competitors  developments with respect to our copyrights or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  changes in interest rates  changes in investors beliefs as to the appropriate price earnings ratios for us and our competitors  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other software companies  changes in management  sales of common stock by our controlling shareholders  directors and executive officers

fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
although no such lawsuits are currently pending against us and we are not aware that any such lawsuit is threatened to be filed in the future  there is no assurance that we will not be sued based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial cost and divert management s attention and resources 
in addition  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities 
our dividend policy is subject to change 
since the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of per share 
we currently expect to declare and pay cash dividends at this level on a quarterly basis in the future 
however  our dividend policy may be affected by  among other things  our views on business conditions  our financial position  earnings  earnings outlook  capital spending plans and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant at that time 
our dividend policy may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts

such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that other shareholders might find favorable  which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia law may inhibit a takeover of our company 
our basic corporate documents and georgia law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

our board of directors does not have a majority of independent directors  and our compensation committee is not required to consist entirely of independent directors
