in addition  highbury paid quarterly dividends of per share of common stock and special dividends of and per share of common stock on october  and april   respectively 
over the term of its investment  peerless received aggregate dividends of million on its highbury common stock investment 
on august   our board of directors approved a tender offer to acquire up to  shares of its common stock at a cash price of per share  or a total price of million 
the tender offer was commenced on october  and expired on november  giving effect to shares properly tendered pursuant to a notice of guaranteed delivery  a total of  shares were properly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer at a total purchase price of  we completed the purchase of all properly tendered shares on november  as of january   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash balance consists of amounts received in the kmc transaction  gains realized from our investment in highbury and revenues generated by our operations  less the approximately million associated with the tender offer discussed above and expenses 
in december  the company opened an office in stamford  connecticut  which became the company s headquarters on february  the company continues to maintain an office in el segundo  california 
services provided following the kmc transaction  our primary business is licensing software based imaging and networking systems for the digital document product marketplace 
licensing revenues were and of total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year we elected to discontinue engineering services and maintenance services 
engineering services and maintenance revenues were and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
our historical business has consisted of i products with peerless developed intellectual property  ii products based upon our agreement with novell to sublicense and support nest office sdk and iii products based upon an agreement with adobe systems corporation adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into products for oems 
our agreement with adobe expired on march  subsequent to march   we are no longer able to license new devices with respect to our adobe line of business 
we will continue to collect licensing fees from our customers for the commercial life of all of their adobe related products existing as of march  under our current sublicense agreements 
however  all maintenance revenue generated from our products ended on july  we continue to be party to a license agreement with novell 
we expect to continue to collect licensing fees for the useful life of the novell related technology 
customers we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from direct sales to digital document product oems 
we have a license agreement with novell which has generated substantial revenues for us 
our license agreement with adobe  which expired on march   generated substantial revenues for us through its expiration 
this agreement will only continue to generate revenue through the commercial life of existing licensed devices 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our company and our historical business we expect a decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the expiration of our agreement with adobe below 
we anticipate that our future revenues may be similarly concentrated with a limited number of customers 
upon the consummation of the kmc transaction  most of our prior revenue generating agreements with kmc were terminated 
kmc may continue from time to time to sublicense third party technology from us 
our largest customers constituting greater than of our total revenues vary to some extent from year to year as product cycles end and contractual relationships expire 
we had three such customers in fiscal years and  which accounted for million and million of our revenues in such years  constituting and of our total revenues  respectively 
our licensing arrangements are based on the number of products  including our technology  shipped by our customers and the life cycles of these products 
because we generate a large percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers and a few products  any loss of these customers or products would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our company and our historical business there is currently limited demand for our products  and demand will continue to decline in the future below 
many of our oem customers have operations in japan 
we are uncertain whether the earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in japan that occurred in march and april will affect our customers 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our company and our historical business the recent earthquake and related events in japan may have a material adverse effect on our business and results in fiscal and future years below 
market segments and geographic areas we sell our products and services to oems which produce products for the enterprise and office sector of the digital document product market 
this market is characterized by digital document products ranging in price from approximately to  each at the low end  to more than  at the high end 
these products typically offer high performance and are differentiated by customized features 
as a result of these unique requirements  we have typically addressed the office sector of the digital document product market via direct oem relationships with individual digital document product manufacturers 
our major customers in the office market in fiscal year included konica minolta  oki data and novell 
since the majority of our oem customers are primarily companies headquartered in japan  revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for and of our total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
oem customers headquartered in japan sell products containing our technology primarily in the north american  japanese and european marketplaces 
see note to the consolidated financial statements below for information regarding revenues by geographical region for the last two fiscal years 
all of our contracts with international customers are denominated in us dollars  and we expect this to continue 
as a result  we do not incur material foreign currency transaction costs in our business 
industry overview the document imaging industry has rapidly changed 
historically  most electronic imaging products in the office environment were stand alone  monochrome machines  which were dedicated to a single print  copy  fax or scan function 
today s imaging products combine printer  fax and scan functions in a single  color mfp or all in one aio devices 
these changes in technology and end user requirements have created challenges for digital document product manufacturers 
these challenges include customer expectations for higher performance products at lower prices as well as the desire and ability of product manufacturers to develop more and more technology in house 
technology digital imaging products 
peerless licenses software based embedded imaging components to oems of printers and mfps 
these imaging components increase the performance  image quality and network connectivity while lowering the overall device cost 
our offerings to our customers have included the following products  most of which we sold to kmc and licensed back from kmc in the kmc transaction peerlessprint family of sdks is a fully compatible peerless implementation of hp pcl page description languages 
the majority of peerlessprint sales are made in conjunction with other peerless technology or third party technology 
peerless xps is a rendering solution for applications that use microsoft s xps page description language 
peerless software print server is a software based print server with networking protocols that enables network print and scan connectivity 
peerlessnet web services sdk provides advanced device control and microsoft windows vista support 
peerlessnet security provides advanced network security functions for digital imaging devices 
our license agreements have allowed us to integrate the proprietary technologies we originally developed and to license complementary technologies to our customers in bundled or single sales 
we are party to a license agreement with novell to license the nest office sdk 
from to march  we were party to a license agreement with adobe to license adobe postscript 
our agreement with adobe expired on march  strategy for our company following the closing of the kmc transaction  we have focused on managing costs and aligning expenses to better match anticipated revenue  as well as managing our cash to preserve our capital in the current economic environment 
we are exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value through establishing a new venture or acquiring an existing business  as well as through other investment opportunities 
historical business 
in  we implemented a strategy for our historical business to address declining demand for our core imaging technologies from our traditional oem customer base 
the strategy involves maximizing the value of core technologies and managing costs and aligning expenses to better match anticipated revenue 
managing expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we will continue to manage our business in a manner that aligns our operating expenses with our anticipated revenue streams 
core technologies 
we will continue to license technology which we own or to which we have licensing rights 
although our license agreement with adobe has expired  we will continue to collect license fees from our current oem customers for the commercial life of all of their adobe related products existing as of march  under our current sublicense agreements 
we will continue to license our products with peerless developed intellectual property  our novell related products and other products which we own or to which we have licensing rights to current oem customers 
strategic alternatives 
since the sale of substantially all of our assets in april  we have been identifying and exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value 
as part of this strategy  last year we invested in the common stock of highbury  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in fiscal  our strategy may include establishing a new venture that utilizes the expertise of management and the board of directors  as well as identifying acquisition candidates and investment opportunities 
our inability to implement our strategic plan to develop a new business or acquire or invest in another company  as well as the declining sales trend of our historical business  may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to our business there is currently limited demand for our products and demand will continue to decline in the future below 
interim investment activities 
until we establish a new venture  acquire an existing business or make an investment  the objective of our interim investment activities is to preserve the principal of our cash and cash equivalents and to maintain liquidity  while at the same time seeking higher yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and from time to time may also invest in marketable securities and short term money market funds 
we are exposed to a variety of risks in investments  mainly the stability of the financial institutions in which we maintain our investments and a lowering of interest rates 
however  we do not believe that the risks associated with our interim investment activities would materially affect our operations or results 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of  among other things  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as the early implementation of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
in the kmc transaction  we sold substantially all of our intellectual property  including all of our patents  to kmc and licensed this ip back from kmc on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis  subject to certain restrictions 
in the kmc transaction  we retained certain of our customized intellectual property that had been previously integrated into products we licensed to third parties or specifically created for our customers other than kmc after december  as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into written nondisclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  prospective customers  oems and strategic partners and take further affirmative steps to limit access to and distribution of our software  intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts and in the event such agreements are not timely made  complied with or enforced  we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
see item a 
risk factors 
risk related to our company and our historical business if we fail to adequately protect intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for damages below 
competition the market for outsourced imaging systems for digital document products is highly competitive and characterized by continuous pressure to enhance performance  add functionality  reduce costs and accelerate the release of new products 
we compete on the basis of the set of core technologies we sublicense from third parties  technology expertise  product functionality and price 
our technology primarily competes with solutions developed internally by oems 
virtually all of our oem customers have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources to enhance existing products and to develop future products 
these oems have developed  are developing or may develop competing imaging system technologies and may implement these systems into their products  thereby replacing our technologies and further limiting our future business opportunities 
oems have increasingly been shifting away from third party solutions in favor of in house development 
therefore  we face competition from products internally developed by oems 
although we continue to license and market the technology which we own or to which we have licensing rights directly to oem customers  we have experienced increased difficulty in these efforts 
our opportunities have been limited since the completion of the kmc transaction and have become further limited because our license agreement with adobe  pursuant to which we bundled and sublicensed adobe s licensed products into new products for oems  expired on march  we compete in the digital document product marketplace 
our competitors include electronics for imaging inc  primax corporation formerly known as destiny technology corporation  global graphics software ltd  sofha gmbh  software imaging and zoran corporation formerly oak technologies 
our networking and security products compete with  among others  silex technology inc  safenet inc and rsa  a division of emc corporation 
employees as of january   we had four full time employees  one part time employee and one consultant 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced any work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees

risk factors our short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to the information contained in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section of the exchange act  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
see forward looking statements above 
risks related to our company and our historical business we expect a decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the expiration of our agreement with adobe 
our agreement with adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into new oem products expired on march  we are unable to transition our customer base to another provider 
we will only continue to collect licensing fees for the commercial life of all adobe related products which existed as of march  for the useful life of these products under existing sublicense agreements 
we expect a material decrease in our revenues for fiscal due to the end of this agreement 
our revenues from licensing products that include adobe technology were approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
there is currently limited demand for our products and demand will continue to decline in the future 
following the completion of the kmc transaction  we continue to license and market the technology which we own or to which we have licensing rights directly to oem customers 
our licensing arrangements with our customers are based on the number of products including our technology shipped by these customers and the life cycles of these products 
because we generate a large percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers and a few products  any loss of these customers or products would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
there has been a general decline in the rates of growth for the monochrome work group printer and mfp market segments in which we are engaged 
for those product platforms that do utilize the software we license  the competition has increased and we have experienced significant downward price pressure 
although we are able to modify our technology to meet the needs of our customers  since  we have elected not to develop new products and since late  we have elected not to maintain a development engineering staff 
as a result of this decision  oem demand for our solutions has declined 
this decline also occurred in some cases because the oems perceived that our solutions did not meet their technical requirements 
in other cases it occurred because the oems either developed the technology themselves or utilized lower cost offshore software competitors 
although we continue to license our current technology and products to certain oems  there can be no assurance that the oems will continue to need or utilize the products and technology we currently offer 
we had an agreement with adobe to bundle and sublicense adobe s licensed products into new oem products which expired on march  this termination has substantially reduced the range of products we are able to offer 
we believe this will materially diminish our ability to continue licensing products in the future 
we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and any adverse change in our relationships with those customers will materially harm our business 
a limited number of oem customers continue to provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
presently  there are only a small number of oem customers in the digital document product market to which we can market our technology and services 
therefore  our ability to offset a significant decrease in the revenues from a particular customer or to replace a lost customer is severely limited 
during fiscal year  three customers  konica minolta  oki data and novell  each generated greater than of our revenues  and collectively contributed of our revenues for the year 
perpetual and block licenses for the same time period were of the company s revenue 
along with our oem customers and third party technology suppliers  we face intense competition within our industry  which is applying significant downward pricing pressure on products and services 
as a result  our oem customers and third party technology suppliers continue to seek lower cost alternatives 
some of our oem customers and third party technology suppliers  including adobe  have developed extensive offshore operations in countries such as india that are capable of delivering lower cost solutions 
the ability of our oem customers and third party technology suppliers to provide similar offerings at a lower cost may result in them no longer needing our services  as well as being in direct competition with us by providing similar technologies at a lower cost to our other customers 
this may result in us losing some of our customers and may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future cash flows 
see note risks and uncertainties to the financial statements below 
our licensing revenue is subject to significant fluctuations which may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our recurring license agreements result in revenues associated with the sale of block and perpetual licenses 
we have relied on block licenses due to aging oem products in the marketplace  oem demands in negotiating license agreements  reductions in the number of oem products shipping and a product mix that changed from object code licensing arrangements to sdks 
revenues may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as the number of opportunities varies  if the signing of block licenses are delayed or the licensing opportunities are lost to competitors 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the industry for imaging systems for digital document products involves intense competition and rapid technological changes  and our business will likely be materially harmed when our competitors develop superior technology 
we anticipate increasing competition for our color products  particularly as new competitors develop and sell competing products 
some of our existing competitors  many of our potential competitors  and virtually all of our oem customers have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than we have 
furthermore  we are not investing in technology to update our products 
other competitors are likely to develop new products which replace the products we currently offer 
if price competition increases  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the amount of royalties received on new licenses 
new technology developed by our competitors and reduced royalties will result in further losses and decrease in our market share 
our income in fiscal years and was increased due to our investment in highbury 
we expect our fiscal net income to be substantially lower than in fiscal years and in fiscal  we had net income of million  including approximately million in dividends received on shares of common stock of highbury 
in fiscal  we had net income of million  including approximately million in dividends received on common stock of highbury 
we had approximately million in pre tax net income in connection with our investment in highbury and amg common stock  which was recognized over fiscal years and since these were one time events  we expect our income to be lower in fiscal and future years 
the recent earthquake and related events in japan may have a material adverse effect on our business and results in fiscal and future years 
in fiscal  japan headquartered oem customers represented of our revenues 
at present we are unable to determine the impact  if any  of the earthquakes  tsunami and related events that occurred in japan in march and april the earthquakes  tsunami and related events  including effects on the availability of electric power  public transportation and parts as well as damage to any manufacturing facilities of our customers  could affect our customers and therefore have a substantial material adverse effect on our business and financial results in fiscal and future years 
if we fail to adequately protect intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we could lose our intellectual property rights or be liable for damages 
we protect our proprietary rights in a number of ways  including  but not limited to  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as early implementation of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of the kmc transaction  we sold substantially all of our intellectual property  including all of our patents to kmc and executed a license agreement pursuant to which kmc licensed the intellectual property ip back to us on a nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual and royalty free basis subject to certain restrictions 
excluded from the ip that was sold to kmc was all of our customized intellectual property that had been previously integrated into products or services licensed or otherwise provided by us to third parties or specifically created for our customers after december  other than kmc and  which  in either case  had not also been provided to or integrated into products or services licensed to kmc  or developed pursuant to or in connection with certain agreements with kmc 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into written nondisclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  prospective customers  oems and strategic partners and take further affirmative steps to limit access to and distribution of our software  intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts and in the event such agreements are not timely made  complied with or enforced  we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
in any event  enforcement of our proprietary rights may be very expensive 
our source code also is protected as a trade secret 
however  from time to time  we license our source code to oems pursuant to protective agreements  which subjects us to the risk of unauthorized use or misappropriation despite the contractual terms restricting disclosure  distribution  copying and use 
in addition  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to obtain  distribute  copy or use our proprietary information  or to reverse engineer our trade secrets 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products using our technologies increasingly may become the subject of infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of us  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
we may lack sufficient resources to initiate a meritorious claim 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any litigation regarding intellectual property  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or obtain licenses to infringing or substituted technology 
our failure to develop or license on acceptable terms a substitute technology  if required  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are not in compliance with our license agreements  we may lose our rights to sublicense technology  our competitors are aggressively pursuing the sale of licensed third party technology 
we currently sublicense third party technologies to our oem customers  which sublicenses accounted for million and million in revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
such sublicense agreements are non exclusive 
if we are determined not to be in compliance with the agreements between us and our licensors  we may forfeit our right to sublicense these technologies 
likewise  if such sublicense agreements expire  we would lose our right to sublicense the affected technologies 
additionally  the licensing of these technologies has become very competitive  with competitors possessing substantially greater financial and technical resources and market penetration than us 
as competitors are pursuing aggressive strategies to obtain similar rights as held by us to sublicense these third party technologies  there is no assurance that we can remain competitive in the marketplace if one or more competitors are successful in this strategy 
our international activities may expose us to risks associated with international business 
we are substantially dependent on our international business activities 
risks inherent in these international business activities include changes in the economic  geographic or environmental conditions of foreign countries  including  but not limited to  japan where many of our customers are located  the imposition of government controls  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  and major currency rate fluctuations  which may affect demand for our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to adapt to international conditions  our business may be adversely affected 
the failure of any financial institution in which we deposit funds could significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available for our corporate and business purposes 
we maintain our cash equivalents in various accounts with nationally recognized financial institutions 
although we have diversified our holdings in multiple institutions  our accounts may be uninsured and therefore subject to loss or total forfeiture 
financial institutions are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which have been exacerbated by the current financial and credit crisis and bankruptcies which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues 
if any of the financial institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fails or freezes redemptions of our accounts  we may lose part or all of our investments 
the loss of part or all of our investments could significantly reduce the amount of cash we have available for our corporate and business purposes  which would materially and adversely affect our operations 
failure to maintain our nasdaq listing would adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock 
if we are not able to maintain compliance with nasdaq s listing requirements  our common stock may be subject to removal from listing on the nasdaq capital market 
trading in our common stock after a delisting  if any  would likely be conducted in the over the counter markets in the so called pink sheets or the over the counter markets and could also be subject to additional restrictions 
as a consequence of a delisting  our stockholders would find it more difficult to dispose  or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value  of our common stock 
in addition  a delisting would make our common stock substantially less attractive as collateral for margin and purpose loans  for investment by financial institutions under their internal policies or state legal investment laws or as consideration in future capital raising transactions 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or financial reporting practices  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective or any assurance that the controls  accounting processes  procedures and underlying assumptions will not be subject to revision 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls and financial reporting practices  including collusion  management override and failure of human judgment 
because of this  control procedures and financial reporting practices are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
we are required to document and test our internal control procedures under section of the sarbanes oxley act  which includes annual management assessments of the effectiveness of such internal controls 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovered material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our system of controls and audits results in a change of practices or new information or conclusions about our financial reporting  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
we rely on the services of our executive officers  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our management 
management may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could harm our business 
failure to retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
risk related to our strategy to increase value for stockholders since the closing of the tender offer on november   the company has fewer resources and alternatives to pursue its strategy to enhance stockholder value 
on november   the company completed a tender offer to acquire up to  shares of its common stock at a cash price of per share  or a total price of million 
a total of  shares were properly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer and purchased at a total price of  as of january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this amount will be used  along with revenues and receivables  to fund the company s future operating expenses  which totaled million in fiscal  as well as to pursue its strategy to enhance stockholder value 
with a reduced cash balance  the company has fewer resources to explore various alternatives to enhance value for stockholders  and a more limited range of available alternatives 
a significant portion of our working capital could be expended in pursuing strategies that do not enhance value for all stockholders 
we expect that the investigation of each specific opportunity  structuring of the transaction  drafting and execution of relevant agreements  disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial time and attention and substantial costs including  but not limited to  costs for accountants  attorneys and other advisors 
in addition  we may determine to investigate developing a new business  which may include substantial legal and or financial advisory costs  or to make downpayments or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating business combinations 
if we determine not to  or are unable to consummate a specific opportunity  the costs incurred will not be recoverable 
any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred  which could materially and adversely affect our subsequent attempts to locate and combine with another business 
our current corporate strategy depends in part on our ability to successfully establish a new venture  acquire an existing company or make another investment 
our failure to execute this strategy could reduce our earnings and reduce our cash reserves 
in addition  our investments  developments and or acquisitions may be subject to substantial risk 
our current corporate strategy involves exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value through establishing a new venture or acquiring an existing business  as well as through other investment opportunities 
potential risks related to this strategy include lack of necessary capital  the inability to satisfy closing conditions  failure to identify suitable or economically acceptable alternatives  the inability to successfully integrate a new business into our operations 
our ability to enhance value to stockholders and manage growth depends upon our ability to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of new operations could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
in addition  even if we develop a new business or invest in or acquire another company  there is no guarantee that such transactions will be successful in producing revenue or profits 
we are pursuing a strategy which may not enhance value for stockholders 
since the completion of the kmc transaction in april  we have been exploring various alternatives to enhance stockholder value through establishing a new venture or acquiring an existing business  as well as through other investment opportunities 
however  we may not be able to identify an appropriate alternative 
if we do identify a suitable opportunity for a new business  acquisition or investment  we may not be able to successfully and satisfactorily execute the opportunity 
furthermore  if we are successful in executing the opportunity  the integration of the opportunity will involve a number of risks and presents financial  managerial and operational challenges 
therefore  we cannot assure that this strategy will enhance value to stockholders 
we may be subject to further government regulation  including the investment company act of  which could adversely affect our operations 
although we are not currently engaged in the business of investing  reinvesting  or trading in securities  and do not currently hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities  peerless may be deemed to be an inadvertent investment company under section a c of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  if the value of its investment securities as defined in the investment company act is found to be more than of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash and certain cash equivalents 
peerless does not intend to be regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
however  if peerless were deemed an investment company requiring registration under the investment company act  applicable restrictions could make it impractical for peerless to continue its business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the event that peerless were to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  peerless would be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the act  including limitations on our capital structure  limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities  restrictions on acquisitions of interests in partner companies  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  prohibitions on the issuance of options and other limitations on our ability to compensate key employees  certain governance requirements  restrictions on specific investments  and reporting  record keeping  voting and proxy disclosure requirements 
if we are deemed an investment company subject to registration under the investment company act  compliance costs and burdens upon peerless may increase and the additional requirements may constrain peerless ability to conduct its business  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition

we have established a new corporate headquarters in stamford  connecticut while maintaining an office in el segundo  california 
although we now have two offices  we have reduced total expected rent expenses by approximately  in fiscal year critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for our software revenues in accordance with provisions of accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements formerly known as statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with asc and  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period 
if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment 
for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by asc if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  unless the only undelivered element is a service in which revenue from the delivered element is recognized over the service period 
product licensing cost we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
certain product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
stock based compensation on february  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb asc  compensation stock compensation formerly known as fas r share based payments using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined using a black scholes option pricing model and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
we use our actual stock trading history as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
compensation expense for share based awards is recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
we recognize these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of four years 
we recorded approximately  in stock based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended january  this consisted of approximately  for a grant of common stock to an employee  approximately  for issuances of restricted common stock  approximately  for option issuances and approximately  for the forfeiture of restricted common stock 
stock based compensation expense was allocated as follows for the twelve month period ended january   in sales and marketing and  included in general and administrative expense 
we granted  options and issued  shares of common stock and  shares of restricted common stock in the twelve months ended january   of the options and  shares of restricted common stock were forfeited due to board resignations in connection with the company s tender offer completed in november income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years resulting from differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax provision is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in february  the company adopted fasb asc  income taxes formerly known as fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements below for further information 
asc clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained  then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as of january   we had available deferred tax assets of approximately  to reduce future income tax liabilities  which consisted primarily of accrued book expenses  which become deductible in the next fiscal year 
the company utilized all of its federal net operating losses of approximately million to reduce its taxable income  during the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal the company also used the maximum amount of research and development credits of million in the state of california to offset income for the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately  substantially all of the company s remaining deferred tax assets were permanently impaired due to a deemed ownership change in connection with the company s self tender offer completed on november  the deemed ownership change occurred pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and resulted in the impairment of approximately million of research and development credits and approximately  in net operating losses in the state of california
