overview we deliver value to businesses by providing software products  web performance services  professional services  and application services that improve the performance of information technology organizations 
our primary source of profitability and cash flow is the sale of our mainframe productivity tools mainframe that are used within our customers mainframe computing environments for fault diagnosis  file and data management  application performance monitoring and application debugging 
we have experienced lower volumes of software license deals for our mainframe solutions causing our mainframe product revenue to decline 
changes in our current customer it computing environments and spending habits have impacted their need for additional mainframe computing capacity 
in addition  increased competition and pricing pressures have had an impact on revenues 
our customers utilize our products to reduce operating cost  increase programmer productivity and create a smooth labor force transition to the next generation of mainframe environment programmers 
we will continue to make strategic enhancements to our mainframe solutions through research and development investments with the goal of meeting these needs and maintaining a maintenance renewal rate in excess of 

table of contents the cash flow generated from our mainframe solutions has allowed us to make significant investments in our apm and application services solutions 
this investment includes the addition of web performance services through the acquisition of gomez in november and research and development expenditures that enhance our vantage and web performance services solutions 
we have identified the apm market as one of our primary targets for revenue growth 
web applications and the complex distributed applications delivery chain supporting them have become increasingly critical to a company s brand awareness  revenue growth and overall market share 
because of this  the market for apm solutions is large and is growing rapidly 
our web performance services  which are marketed under the brand name gomez and provided on a saas platform  and our vantage solutions ensure the optimal performance of these applications across the enterprise  the internet and the cloud 
to support the growth initiatives for our apm product line  we are developing solutions that combine the technology from our vantage products with technology from our web performance services 
during the third quarter of  we released a controlled launch of our first mile solution which integrates components of vantage and our web performance services into a single solution that measures the performance of our customer s web application delivery chain  including elements that reside both within the customer s data center and on the internet  displaying performance information through a single dashboard 
we anticipate these combined solutions will add value to our customers and provide us opportunities to sell additional non integrated vantage products and web performance services driving future apm revenue growth 
we have also identified the secured collaboration service market as a growth business 
our application services  which are marketed under the brand name covisint and provided on a saas platform  globally connect business communities  organizations and systems allowing the secure sharing of vital business information  applications and business processes across their internal and extended enterprise 
the market for these services is growing  particularly in the healthcare industry as hospitals  physicians and the united states government move towards establishing electronic patient health and medical records which will require secure computerized databases and environments for storing and sharing of information 
a significant amount of government funding for this conversion to electronic health and medical records is dependent on the dispersal of federal stimulus funds 
we continue to enhance our changepoint and uniface solutions primarily through research and development expenditures 
our changepoint solution provides a single automated solution for professional services organizations to forecast and plan  and manage resources  projects and client engagements 
in addition  for project centric organizations  changepoint provides a cohesive and consolidated view of projects  investments  resources and applications to help manage the entire business portfolio 
our uniface solution is mature with over years on the market 
uniface is a rapid application development environment for building  renewing and integrating the latest complex enterprise applications 
we continue to make investments in uniface to make available the benefits of the uniface development environment across an expanded range of technologies  and with additional features 
the professional services segment began a transformation during the second half of when management decided to exit low margin engagements and focus resources on more profitable engagements 
this significantly improved the segment s contribution margin but resulted in a significant revenue decline 
this transformation is complete and we experienced year over year quarterly growth in revenue during the fourth quarter of we anticipate modest revenue and contribution margin growth within the segment going forward as we focus on effectively demonstrating the value of our service offerings to customers 

table of contents in may  we exited the quality and testing business by selling our quality and devpartner distributed product lines divested products to micro focus international plc micro focus 
in early fiscal  compuware announced its initiative 
the compuware organizational model features a business unit structure for our apm  changepoint  mainframe  uniface  covisint and professional services lines of business 
we believe this structure will maximize our market agility and responsiveness  enabling us to capitalize on market conditions and competitive advantages for maximum growth and profitability 
as a result of this organizational change we will modify our reporting units and segments in fiscal to be consistent with this business unit structure

the increase in distributed license fees was partially offset by a million decline in mainframe license fees as two large transactions expected to close in fiscal were delayed and expected to close during the first half of fiscal excluding the million impact from divested products  license fees decreased million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal mainframe products accounted for million of the decrease and our distributed products accounted for million of the decrease 
our distributed product decline was primarily due to a million decline in uniface and changepoint license fees  offset by a million increase in vantage license fees 
the license fee decline occurred during our first quarter of fiscal as the global economic slowdown that began during the second quarter of fiscal continued to affect the closure of license transactions for all our product lines 
the decline was partially offset by license growth during the remainder of fiscal as economic conditions began to improve causing customers to increase technology spending

the decline was partially offset by an increase in vantage maintenance fees primarily due to sales growth in our vantage product line 

table of contents excluding the million impact from divested products  maintenance fees decreased million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of reductions in our mainframe product lines 
the global economic slowdown that began during the second quarter of fiscal also impacted maintenance contracts for new mainframe arrangements and the pricing of existing arrangements being renewed

one part of the legislation contains provisions that replace the current michigan business tax mbt with a new corporate income tax 
certain credits allowed under the mbt  including the brownfield redevelopment tax credit  will continue to be effective  which will allow us to reduce our future tax liability for the duration of the carryforward period

table of contents management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from licensing software products  providing maintenance and support services for those products  rendering web performance  professional including product related services and application services 
we provide software deliverables that include licensed software products  maintenance and professional services related to our software product related services 
we also provide non software deliverables  such as professional services unrelated to our software professional services  and web performance and application services where we grant the customer a right to use software but they do not have the right or capability to take possession of the software 
for arrangements that contain both software and non software deliverables almost all of these arrangements combine software deliverables with web performance services  in accordance with asc revenue recognition  we split the arrangements between software and non software deliverables using the following hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  meaning price when sold separately if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
we currently are unable to establish vsoe or third party evidence for our web performance services or software deliverables taken as a group 
therefore  we create our best estimate of selling price by evaluating renewal amounts included in a contract  if any  and prices of deliverables sold separately  taking into consideration geography  volume discounts  and transaction size 
once we have allocated the arrangement between software deliverables and non software deliverables  we recognize revenue as described below in the respective product revenue recognition  web performance services fees and professional and application services fees sections 
in order for a transaction to be eligible for revenue recognition  the following revenue criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
product revenue recognition we license software products using both perpetual and term time based licenses  provide maintenance services and software related professional services 
our software related professional services do not require significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software product 

table of contents assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met  perpetual license fee revenue is recognized upfront  using the residual method  under which the fair value of the undelivered elements eg  maintenance and software professional services are deferred  based on vsoe of these elements 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and software professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and software professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and software professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or software professional services or have an effect on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications  if any  made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe can be established 
when maintenance or services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or over the period in which the services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include time based and unlimited capacity licenses as we do not sell maintenance separately and therefore cannot establish vsoe for these undelivered elements in these arrangements 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate recognition of the software license fees  maintenance fees and as applicable  professional services fees under asc however  to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue based on its determination of fair value 
we apply our vsoe for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and stand alone services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 
we allow customers to have installment payment terms in our arrangements and generally  revenues from these transactions are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in our customer collection experience  future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
web performance services fees our subscription fees relate to arrangements that permit our customers to access and utilize our web performance services 
the subscription arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
subscription fees are deferred upon contract execution and are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional and application services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for development services rendered under a fixed price contract  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and if determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
our application services fees are combined with professional services fees in our consolidated statement of operations and consist of fees for our on demand software and other services 
the arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
many of our application service fee contracts include a one time project one time fee and then ongoing saas operations recurring fees for the project 
the one time fees do not qualify as a separate element of accounting as we are the only vendor to provide these services 
therefore  revenue associated with the one time fees is recognized over the expected service period as the customer derives value from the recurring fees  consistent with the proportional performance method 
the recurring fees are deferred upon contract execution and are recognized ratably over the term of the software as a service contract 

table of contents unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete our fixed price or customer s structure setup projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
capitalized software we follow the guidance of asc costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed when capitalizing development costs associated with our software products and asc internal use software when capitalizing development costs associated with our web performance services and application services networks 
the cost of purchased and internally developed software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software technology which is generally three to five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products  services and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the performance test involves a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we measure the fair value of reporting units and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the key assumptions in the market comparable value analysis are peer group selection and application of this peer group to the respective reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the company performs step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
there is a high degree of judgment regarding management s forecast for the reporting units as market developments for both customers and competitors can affect actual results 
there can also be uncertainty regarding management s selection of peer companies as an exact match of peer companies is unlikely to exist 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg  economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
at march   our software products  web performance services and application services reporting units did not fail step of our goodwill impairment analysis 
our professional services reporting unit  with a goodwill balance of million  was the only reporting unit where the estimated fair value was not substantially in excess of the carrying value  as the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately at march  
table of contents the events and circumstances that could affect our key assumptions for the professional services reporting unit and the analysis of fair value include the following our ability to achieve sales productivity at a level to achieve the profitability in the forecast period 
failure of our billable staff to meet their utilization or rate targets 
our ability to hire and retain sales  technology and management personnel 
future negative changes in the worldwide economies 
increased competition and pricing pressures within the professional services market 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these liabilities and  therefore  to our net income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock awards in accordance with asc share based payment 
stock award compensation costs  net of an estimated forfeiture rate approximately  are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for fiscal risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in fiscal was per option share 

table of contents if we increase the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent in order to create a maximum compensation expense scenario  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent to create a minimum compensation expense scenario  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would decrease percent 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   and  cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in customer cash collections of million as our strategy to exit low margin professional services engagements has reduced our cash collections related to professional services during and  and the decline in our mainframe product revenue 
the decrease in cash was further impacted by an increase in employee bonus and commission payments of approximately million during fiscal the decrease was partially offset by a million decline in income taxes paid to taxing authorities due to the decline in pre tax net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase in rental income receipts and reductions in building rent payments during fiscal the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report compute net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from acquisitions  the divestiture and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue have typically had the largest impact on the reconciliation of net income to compute cash flows from operating activities as we allow for deferred payment terms on multi year products contracts 
the decrease in the net change of accounts receivable was million and primarily relates to the timing of billings from multi year product arrangements during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the net change of deferred revenue was million and primarily relates to the decline in mainframe license and maintenance contracts 
the other significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows the adjustment to net income of million resulting from the gain relating to the quality divestiture during the first quarter of the proceeds from the sale were recorded to investing activities  the change in accounts payable and accrued expense balances decreased cash flow from operating activities by million  and was primarily a result of the increase in employee bonus payments during the first quarter of that were accrued for at march   and the change in deferred income taxes which increased cash provided by operating activities by million primarily due to timing differences resulting from increases in capitalized internal software costs and deferred portal customer implementation costs 

table of contents we believe our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the decline in cash used for acquisitions 
we acquired gomez in fiscal for million compared to million used for acquisitions during fiscal the decrease was partially offset by the receipt of million from the quality divestiture during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively  with million of the increase due primarily to computer and network equipment purchases and million of the increase due to increases in capitalized internal software costs related to our software products and web performance services network 
capital expenditures were funded with cash flows from operations 
we will continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
if the cash consideration for an acquisition or combination of acquisitions were to exceed our operating cash balance needs  we would likely utilize our credit facility and may need to seek additional financing 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million increase in cash receipts from employees exercising stock options primarily related to a broad based stock option grant bbso grant that expired in april during the second half of fiscal  our stock price exceeded the exercise price of this bbso grant causing an increase in stock option exercise activity 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal since may  the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase a total of billion of our common stock under a discretionary stock repurchase plan discretionary plan 
purchases of common stock under the discretionary plan may occur on the open market  or through negotiated or block transactions based upon market and business conditions  subject to applicable legal limitations 
during fiscal  we repurchased under the discretionary plan approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total cost of million 
as of march   approximately million remains authorized for future purchases under the discretionary plan 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares under the discretionary plan  funded primarily through our operating cash flow and  if needed  funds from our credit facility 
our long term goal is to reduce our outstanding common share count to approximately million shares  though we may adjust our goals based on our cash position and market conditions 
we reserve the right to change the timing and volume of our repurchases at any time without notice see part ii item for additional information regarding our discretionary plan 
our standard quarterly black out period commences business days prior to the end of each quarter and terminates one full market day following the public release of our operating results for the period 
the company has a credit facility with comerica bank and other lenders to provide leverage for the company if needed 
the credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million and expires on november  the credit facility also permits us to increase the facility by an additional million  subject to receiving further commitments from lenders and certain other conditions 
the credit facility also limits borrowing outside of the facility to million 
we did not borrow against our credit facility during fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the credit facility 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the cause of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in customer collections of million resulting from the decline in revenue  primarily professional services  and an increase in income taxes paid during fiscal compared to fiscal of million 
the decrease was partially offset by reductions in disbursements for employee payroll and benefits of million primarily due to the cost savings achieved from our restructuring initiatives 
the increase in the net change of accounts receivable of million was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in professional services fees throughout fiscal on the accounts receivable balance 
the increase in the net change of deferred revenue of million from fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in deferred revenue associated with our web performance services since the gomez acquisition 
the other significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows the adjustment to net income of million resulting from the gain on divestiture of our quality and devpartner product lines the proceeds from the sale were recorded to investing activities  and the change in accounts payable and accrued expense balances increasing cash flow from operating activities by million primarily due to the changes in our bonus and commission accruals which increased from march  to march  as of march   we had million accrued for restructuring actions see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to manage the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
cash investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
our investment portfolio consists of cash investments that have a cost basis and fair value totaling million as of march  the average interest rate and average tax equivalent interest rate were as of march  these investments will mature within the next three months 
we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and  are due in fiscal through fiscal  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated  positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  at march   the fair value of such receivables was approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have had an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated million positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks related to assets and liabilities that are denominated in non local currency and current inter company balances due to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to sell or buy currencies with the intent of mitigating foreign exchange rate risks related to these balances 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to anticipated revenue or expenses denominated in foreign currency 
all foreign exchange derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note of the consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss that a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  we believe such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
