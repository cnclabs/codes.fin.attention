contract provisions and subcontracting most of our revenue is derived from engineering  construction and epc contracts 
the majority of our contracts fall into the following basic categories firm fixed price or lump sum fixed price contracts  providing for a single price for the total amount of work or for a number of fixed lump sums for the various work elements comprising the total price  cost plus fixed fee contracts where income is earned solely from the fee received  unit price contracts  which specify a price for each unit of work performed  time and materials contracts where personnel and equipment are provided under an agreed upon schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable  and a combination of the above including lump sum payment for certain items and unit rates for others 
changes in scope of work are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties 
change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process 
these change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue either positively or negatively 
we usually obtain contracts through either competitive bidding or negotiations with long standing clients 
we are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists 
bidders are pre qualified on the basis of their prior performance for such clients  as well as their experience  reputation for quality  safety record  financial strength and bonding capacity 
in evaluating bid opportunities  we consider such factors as the client and their geographic location  the difficulty of the work  current and projected workload  the likelihood of additional work  the project s cost and profitability estimates  and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders 
we give careful thought and consideration to the political and financial stability of the country or region where the work is to be performed 
the bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system  enabling management to monitor projects effectively 

table of contents all us government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client 
in addition  some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control 
we act as the primary contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as the primary contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  horizontal directional drills  non destructive inspection  catering and security 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as the primary contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease possibly resulting in a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in some cases  we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs  and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred 
revenue from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price 
profit on change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders 
these amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term 
if we do not successfully resolve these matters  a net expense recorded as a reduction in revenues  may be required  in addition to amounts that have been previously provided 
contractual arrangements we provide services under msas and on a project by project basis 
msas are typically one to three years in duration  but can be longer 
under our msas  our customers generally agree to use us to provide certain services in a specified geographic region on stipulated terms and conditions  including pricing and escalation 
however  most of our contracts  including msas and our alliance agreement with oncor  may be terminated by our customers on short notice 
further  although our customers assign work to us under our msas  our customers often have no obligation to assign work to us and are not required to use us exclusively  in some cases subject to our right of first refusal 
in addition  many of our contracts  including our msas  are opened to public bid and generally attract multiple bidders 
work performed under msas is typically billed on a unit price or time and materials basis 
in addition  any work encountered in the course of a unit price project that does not have a defined unit is generally completed on a time and materials basis 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  pricing is typically based on a unit price or fixed price structure 
under our unit price contracts  we agree to perform identified units of work for an agreed price 
a unit can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation 
the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed fee based on our estimate of the aggregate costs of completing the particular project 
we are sometimes unable to fully recover cost overruns on our fixed price contracts 
we expect that industry trends could result in an increase in the proportion of our contracts being performed on a unit price or fixed price basis resulting in more profitability risk 

table of contents our storm restoration work  which involves high labor and equipment utilization  is typically performed on a time and materials basis and is generally more profitable when performed off system rather than for customers with which we have msas 
our ability to allocate resources to storm restoration work depends on our capacity at that time and permission from existing customers to release some portion of our workforce from their projects 
oncor alliance agreement on june   we entered into a non exclusive agreement with oncor 
due to the extensive scope and long duration of the agreement  we refer to it as an alliance agreement 
we summarize below the principal terms of the agreement 
this summary is not a complete description of all the terms of the agreement 
term  renewals and extensions 
the agreement became effective on august  and will continue until expiration on december   unless extended  renewed or terminated in accordance with its terms 
provision of services  spending levels and pricing 
under the agreement  it is anticipated that we will provide oncor transmission construction and maintenance services tcm  and distribution construction and maintenance services dcm  pursuant to fixed price  unit price and time and materials structures 
the fees we charge oncor under unit price and time and materials structures are set forth in the agreement  most of which are adjusted annually according to indices provided in the agreement 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby oncor receives pricing at least as favorable as we charge other customers for any similar services which is not a defined term in the agreement 
management believes  based on our pricing practices and the nature and scope of the services we provide to oncor  that we are in compliance with this provision 
we frequently hold meetings with oncor to discuss its forecasted monthly and annual tcm and dcm spending levels 
the agreement provides for agreed incentives and adjustments for us and for oncor according to oncor s projected spending levels 
calculations based on projected spending levels are subject to subsequent adjustments based on actual spending levels 
the agreement also requires that we provide dedicated resources to oncor and that we meet or exceed minimum service levels as measured by specified performance indicators 
termination 
oncor could in some cases seek to terminate for cause or limit our activity or seek to assess penalties against us under the agreement 
oncor may terminate the agreement upon days notice or any work request thereunder without prior notice in each case at its sole discretion and may terminate the agreement upon days notice in the event there is an announcement of the intent to undertake or an actual occurrence of a change in control of oncor or infrastrux 
oncor consented to the change of control of infrastrux that resulted from our acquisition of infrastrux 
oncor may also terminate the agreement for cause if  among other things  we breach and fail to adequately cure a representation or warranty under the agreement  we materially or repeatedly default in the performance of our material obligations under the agreement or we become insolvent 
in the event oncor terminates the agreement for convenience or due to an anticipated or actual change of control of oncor  oncor must pay us a termination fee 

table of contents employees at december   we directly employed a multi national work force of  persons  of which approximately percent were citizens of the respective countries in which they work 
although the level of activity varies from year to year  we have maintained an average work force of approximately  over the past five years 
the minimum employment during that period has been  and the maximum was  at december   approximately percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements

table of contents insurance and bonding operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and are insured through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program  which includes commercial insurance policies  consisting of the types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the worldwide engineering and construction industry 
we maintain worldwide master policies written mostly through highly rated insurers 
these policies cover our property  plant  equipment and cargo against all normally insurable risks  including war risk  political risk and terrorism in third world countries 
other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations 
primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with the level of our asset base 
risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients 
on other projects  builders all risk insurance is purchased when deemed necessary 
substantially all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level  with the exceptions being certain basic insurance  which must be purchased in some countries in order to comply with local insurance laws 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the future  our ability to maintain insurance  which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable  may be affected by events over which we have no control  such as those that occurred on september  in  we were not constrained by our ability to bond new projects  nor have we been negatively impacted in early global warming and climate change recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
in  the united states supreme court held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act  if it represents a health hazard to the public 
in december  the epa responded to that holding and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of sometimes referred to as the waxman markey global climate change bill 
the us senate considered but did not approve such legislation 
the bill included many provisions that could potentially have had a significant impact on us as well as our customers 
the bill proposed a cap and trade regime  a renewable portfolio standard  electric efficiency standards  revised transmission policy and mandated investments in plug in hybrid infrastructure and smart grid technology 
the net effect of the bill was to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products and natural gas 
although proposals have been introduced in the us senate  including a proposal that would require greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions than the american clean energy and security act of  it is uncertain at this time whether  and in what form  legislation will be adopted by the us senate 
for legislation to become law  both chambers of the us congress would be required to approve identical legislation 
both president obama and the administrator of the epa have repeatedly indicated their preference for comprehensive legislation to address this issue and create the framework for a clean energy economy 
in september  the epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions beginning january  the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year  and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 

table of contents we do not know and cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
depending on the final provisions of such rules or legislation  it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or additional operating restrictions as well as those of our customers 
it is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels  which could adversely affect the demand for some of our services  which in turn could adversely affect our future results of operations 
likewise  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature  storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change or otherwise will have a material impact on our operations 
compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not  to date  had a material effect on the cost of our operations  earnings or competitive position 
however  as noted above in connection with our discussion of the regulation of greenhouse gases  compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks 
risks related to our business our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies on infrastructure 
our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major engineering and construction projects 
the availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  and specifically  the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies on infrastructure 
the credit crisis in  which continues to some extent  and related distress in the global financial system  including capital markets  as well as the global recession  continue to have an adverse impact on the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies and or their ability to finance these expenditures 
our failure to obtain major projects  the delay in awards of major projects  the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under utilization of our resources  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow 
there are numerous factors beyond our control that influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies  including current and projected oil  gas and electric power prices  as well as refining margins  the demand for gasoline and electricity  the abilities of oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power companies to generate  access and deploy capital  exploration  production and transportation costs  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions  regulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers  local and international political and economic conditions  the ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments  and technological advances 
our settlements with the doj and the sec  and the prosecution of former employees  may negatively impact our ongoing operations 
in may  the united states department of justice doj filed an information and deferred prosecution agreement dpa in the united states district court in houston concluding its investigation into violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa by willbros group  inc and its subsidiary  willbros international  inc 
wii 
also in may  we reached a final settlement with the sec to resolve its previously disclosed investigation of possible violations of the fcpa and possible violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in bolivia  ecuador and nigeria 
the settlements together require us to pay  over approximately three years  a total of million in penalties and disgorgement  plus post judgment interest on million of that amount 
see note of our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein 
as part of our agreement with the doj  we are subject to ongoing review and regulation of our business operations  including the review of our operations and compliance program by a government approved independent monitor 
the independent monitor was appointed effective september  the activities of the independent monitor have had  and will continue to have  a material cost to us and will require significant changes in our processes and operations  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
in addition  the settlements  and the prosecution of former employees  may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us  including actions by foreign governments  in countries that are the subject of the settlements 

table of contents our failure to comply with the terms of settlement agreements with the doj and sec would have a material adverse effect on our business 
under our settlement with the doj  we are subject to the dpa  which has an initial term of three years and may be extended under certain circumstances  and  with respect to the sec settlement  we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws 
as provided for in the dpa  with the approval of the doj  we retained a government approved independent monitor  at our expense  for a two and one half year period  who is reporting to the doj on our compliance with the dpa 
since the appointment of the monitor  we have cooperated and provided the monitor with access to information  documents  records  facilities and employees 
on march   the monitor filed with the doj the first of three required reports under the dpa 
in the report  the monitor reported numerous findings and recommendations with respect to the need for the improvement of our administrative internal controls  policies and procedures for detecting and preventing violations of applicable anti corruption laws 
findings and recommendations have been made concerning the need for improvement of policies and processes and internal controls related to the vetting of new employees  agents and consultants  disclosure  tracking and internal communications of conflicts of interest  our fcpa training program  the fcpa certification process  procurement and project controls and other administrative control procedures  as well as to improve our ability to detect and prevent violations of applicable anti corruption laws 
the report also sets out for the doj s review the monitor s findings relating to incidents that came to the monitor s attention during the course of his review which he found to be significant  as well as recommendations to address these incidents 
we and the monitor have met separately with the doj concerning certain of these incidents 
the monitor  in his report  did not conclude whether any of these incidents or any other matters constituted a violation of the fcpa 
we do not believe that any of these incidents or matters constituted a violation of the fcpa based on our own investigations of the incidents and matters raised in the report 
notwithstanding our assessment  the doj could perform further investigation at its discretion of any incident or matter raised by the report 
we are now in the process of improving our hiring procedures and conflict of interest policies and have openly discussed these matters with the doj in the course of our compliance with the terms of the dpa 
on may   we responded to the monitor s report and advised the doj that we intend to implement all of the monitor s recommendations 
we have undertaken a disciplined approach to implementing the monitor s recommendations and have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant costs as well as significant management oversight time to effectively implement the recommendations 
the monitor s second annual review occurred in the first quarter of  and we expect to receive the second report of the monitor near the end of the first quarter of the doj could determine during the term of the dpa that we have violated the fcpa or other laws based on the monitor s findings or otherwise or not complied with the terms of the dpa  which requires our cooperation with the monitor and the doj  or that we have not been successful in implementing the monitor s recommendations 
our failure to comply with the terms of the settlements with the doj and sec could result in resumed prosecution and other regulatory sanctions 
a criminal conviction of the charges that are subject to the dpa  or of other charges  could result in fines  civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief  and would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the settlements and the findings of the independent monitor could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payment of the penalty amounts due to the doj and or the disgorgement amounts specified in the sec settlement  the doj and or the sec will have the right to accelerate payment  and demand that the entire balance be paid immediately 
our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our supervision  training and retention of competent employees  the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our foreign corrupt practices act compliance manual and code of business conduct and ethics  our continuing management of our agents and business partners  and our successful implementation of the recommendations of the independent monitor to further improve our compliance program and internal controls 

table of contents we may continue to experience losses associated with our prior nigeria based operations which could have a material adverse effect on us 
on february   willbros global holdings  inc  formerly known as willbros group  inc  a panama corporation wghi  which is now a subsidiary of the company and holds a portion of the company s non us operations  sold its nigeria assets and nigeria based operations in west africa to ascot offshore nigeria limited ascot  a nigerian oilfield services company  for total consideration of million later adjusted to million 
the sale was pursuant to a share purchase agreement by and between wghi and ascot dated as of february  the agreement  providing for the purchase by ascot of all of the share capital of wg nigeria holdings limited wgnhl  the holding company for willbros west africa  inc wwai  willbros nigeria limited  willbros offshore nigeria limited and wg nigeria equipment limited 
in connection with the sale of its nigeria assets and operations  wghi and wii  another subsidiary of the company  entered into an indemnity agreement with ascot and berkeley group plc berkeley  the parent company of ascot the indemnity agreement  pursuant to which ascot and berkeley agreed to indemnify wghi and wii for any obligations incurred by wghi or wii in connection with the parent company guarantees the guarantees that wghi and wii previously issued and maintained on behalf of certain former subsidiaries now owned by ascot under certain working contracts between the subsidiaries and their customers 
either wghi  wii or both may be contractually obligated  in varying degrees  under the guarantees with respect to the performance of work related to several ongoing projects 
among the guarantees covered by the indemnity agreement are five contracts under which the company estimates that  at february   there was aggregate remaining contract revenue  excluding any additional claim revenue  of million and aggregate estimated cost to complete of million 
at the february  sale date  one of the contracts covered by the guarantees was estimated to be in a loss position with an accrual for such loss of million 
the associated liability was included in the liabilities acquired by ascot and berkeley 
approximately one year after the sale of the nigeria assets and operations  wghi received its first notification asserting various rights under one of the outstanding parent guarantees 
on february   wwai  the ascot company performing the west african gas pipeline wagp contract  received a letter from west african gas pipeline company limited wapco  the owner of wagp  wherein wapco gave written notice alleging that wwai was in default under the wagp contract  as amended  and giving wwai a brief cure period to remedy the alleged default 
we understand that wwai responded by denying being in breach of its wagp contract obligations  and apparently also advised wapco that wwai requires a further million  without which it will not be able to complete the work which it had previously undertaken to perform 
we understand that  on february   wapco terminated the wagp contract for the alleged continuing non performance of wwai 
also  in february  wghi received a letter from wapco reminding wghi of its parent guarantee on the wagp contract and requesting that wghi remedy wwai s default under that contract  as amended 
wghi responded to wapco  consistent with its earlier communications  that  for a variety of legal  contractual  and other reasons  it did not consider the prior wagp contract parent guarantee to have continued application 
in february  wghi received another letter from wapco formally demanding that wghi pay all sums payable in consequence of the non performance by wwai with wapco and stating that quantification of that amount would be provided sometime in the future when the work was completed 
in spite of this letter  we continued to believe that the parent guarantee was not valid 
wapco disputes wghi s position that it is no longer bound by the terms of wghi s prior parent guarantee of the wagp contract and has reserved all its rights in that regard 
on february   wghi received a letter from attorneys representing wapco seeking to recover from wghi under its prior wagp contract parent company guarantee for losses and damages allegedly incurred by wapco in connection with the alleged non performance of wwai under the wagp contract 
the letter purports to be a formal notice of a claim for purposes of the pre action protocol for construction and engineering disputes under the rules of the high court in london  england 
the letter claims damages in the amount of million 
at february   when wghi sold its nigeria assets and operations to ascot  the total wagp contract value was million and the wagp project was estimated to be approximately percent complete 
the remaining costs to complete the project at that time were estimated at slightly under million 
we are seeking to understand the magnitude of the wapco claim relative to the wagp project s financial status three years earlier 

table of contents on august   we received notice that wapco had filed suit against wghi under english law in the london high court on july   for a sum of million 
wghi has several possible defenses to this claim and is contesting the matter vigorously  but we cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome 
we expect the litigation process to be lengthy  trial of the matter is scheduled to commence in june of we currently have no employees working in nigeria and have no intention of returning to nigeria 
if ultimately it is determined by an english court that wghi is liable  in whole or in part  for damages that wapco may establish against wwai for wwai s alleged non performance of the wagp contract  or if wapco is able to establish liability against wghi directly under the parent company guarantee  and  in either case  wghi is unable to enforce its rights under the indemnity agreement entered into with ascot and berkeley in connection with the wagp contract  wghi may experience substantial losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
however  at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of the london high court litigation  or be certain of the degree to which the indemnity agreement given in wghi s favor by ascot and berkeley will protect wghi 
we have not established a reserve for potential losses in connection with the foregoing 
our management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  because of the existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have also had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  our business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  a description of this material weakness is included in item a  controls and procedures  in this form k  together with our remediation plan 
as disclosed in our annual reports on form k for   and  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting identified several material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses led to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and and the first three quarters of we believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated 
our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  and infrastrux had a material weakness in its reporting systems as well 
in connection with its fiscal audit  infrastrux identified a material weakness related to its entity level processes for monitoring and assessing financial reporting risks and ensuring that appropriate procedures and controls are implemented in response to changes 
specifically  this material weakness arose from the combined effect of deficiencies related to i insufficient resources with the appropriate level of experience and training in the application of technical accounting guidance and ii inadequate monitoring  review and approval of the policies and procedures implemented to address new or non recurring accounting transactions  including those designed to ensure relevant  sufficient and reliable data is accumulated to support assumptions and judgments 
this material weakness resulted in errors in the reporting of goodwill and income taxes and required the restatement of infrastrux s and consolidated financial statements 
as of the date of our acquisition of infrastrux  infrastrux believed this material weakness had been successfully remediated 
our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity 
furthermore  because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud  even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements 
our international operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries 
we have operations in the middle east oman and anticipate that a portion of our contract revenue will be derived from  and a portion of our long lived assets will be located in  developing countries 
conducting operations in developing countries presents significant commercial challenges for our business 
a disruption of activities  or loss of use of equipment or installations  at any location in which we have significant assets or operations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we are subject to risks that ordinarily would not be expected to exist to the same extent in the united states  canada  australia or western europe 
some of these risks include civil uprisings  terrorism  riots and war  which can make it impractical to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses  repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements and converting it into dollars or other fungible currency  
table of contents exchange rate fluctuations  which can reduce the purchasing power of local currencies and cause our costs to exceed our budget  reducing our operating margin in the affected country  expropriation of assets  by either a recognized or unrecognized foreign government  which can disrupt our business activities and create delays and corresponding losses  availability of suitable personnel and equipment  which can be affected by government policy  or changes in policy  which limit the importation of skilled craftsmen or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient  governmental instability  which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential customers to be withdrawn or delayed  reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services  decrees  laws  regulations  interpretations and court decisions under legal systems  which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs  and restrictive governmental registration and licensing requirements  which can limit the pursuit of certain business activities 
our operations in developing countries may be adversely affected in the event any governmental agencies in these countries interpret laws  regulations or court decisions in a manner which might be considered inconsistent or inequitable in the united states  canada  australia or western europe 
we may be subject to unanticipated taxes  including income taxes  excise duties  import taxes  export taxes  sales taxes or other governmental assessments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any quarter or year 
these risks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by a concentration of business in a particular country 
due to a limited number of major projects worldwide  we expect to have a substantial portion of our resources dedicated to projects located in a few countries 
therefore  our results of operations are susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in a particular country in which our business may be concentrated at that time 
economic downturns in such countries could also have an adverse impact on our operations 
special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business 
our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent 
since the anti bribery restrictions of the fcpa make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage  we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations  terminations  or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them  in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits 
therefore  project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits 

table of contents managing backlog in our utility t d segment also has other challenges 
backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends  seasonal demand and projected customer needs  but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations  and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice 
for projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are cancelled  we may be reimbursed for certain costs  but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog 
federal and state legislative and regulatory developments that we believe should encourage electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure spending may fail to result in increased demand for our utility t d services 
in recent years  federal and state legislation has been passed and resulting regulations have been adopted that could significantly increase spending on electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure  including the energy act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and state renewable portfolio standard rps programs 
however  much fiscal  regulatory and other uncertainty remains as to the impact this legislation and regulation will ultimately have on the demand for our utility t d services 
for instance  regulations implementing provisions of the energy act of that may affect demand for our utility t d services remain  in some cases  subject to review in various federal courts 
in one such case  decided in february  a federal court of appeals vacated ferc s interpretation of the scope of its backstop transmission line siting authority for electric power transmission projects 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain and may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act of and arra may result in slower growth in demand for our utility t d services 
renewable energy initiatives  including texas crez plan  other rps initiatives and arra  may not lead to increased demand for our utility t d services 
while states and washington dc have mandatory rps programs that require certain percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources  the rps programs adopted in many states became law during periods of substantially higher oil and natural gas prices 
as a result  or for budgetary or other reasons  states may reduce those mandates or make them optional or extend deadlines  which could reduce  delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states 
in addition  states may limit  delay or otherwise alter existing rps programs in anticipation of a potential federal renewable energy standard 
furthermore  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
funding for rps programs may not be available or may be further constrained as a result of the significant declines in government budgets and subsidies and in the availability of credit to finance the significant capital expenditures necessary to build renewable generation capacity 
these factors could lead to fewer projects resulting from rps programs than anticipated or a delay in the timing of these projects and the related infrastructure  which would negatively affect the demand for our utility t d services 
moreover  even if the rps programs are fully developed and funded  we cannot be certain that we will be awarded any resulting contracts 
in addition  we cannot predict when programs under arra will be implemented or the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs  particularly in light of capital constraints on potential developers of these projects 
infrastructure projects such as those envisioned by crez and rps initiatives are also subject to delays or cancellation due to local factors such as siting disputes  protests and litigation 
before we will receive revenues from infrastructure buildouts associated with any of these projects  substantial advance preparations are required such as engineering  procurement  and acquisition and clearance of rights of way  all of which are beyond our control 
investments for renewable energy and electric power infrastructure under arra may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  may be concentrated in locations where we do not have significant capabilities  and any resulting contracts may not be awarded to us  any of which could negatively impact demand for our utility t d services 
in addition  the increase in long term demand for natural gas that we believe will benefit from anticipated us greenhouse gas regulations  such as a cap and trade program or carbon taxes  may be delayed or may not occur 
for example  we cannot predict whether or in what form cap and trade provisions and renewable energy standards such as those in the bill passed by the us house of representatives in will become law  especially in light of senate majority leader reid s decision to advance an energy bill which does not include cap and trade provisions 
it is difficult to accurately predict the timing and scope of any potential greenhouse gas regulations that may ultimately be adopted or the extent to which demand for natural gas will increase as a result of any such regulations 

table of contents our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us 
we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
our failure to resolve matters related to a facility construction project termination could have a material adverse impact on us 
on january   transcanada pipelines  ltd 
tcpl notified us that we were in breach of contract and were being terminated for cause immediately on a cost reimbursable plus fixed fee construction contract for seven pump stations in nebraska and kansas that was awarded to us in september at the time of termination  we had completed approximately percent of our scope of work 
we have disputed the validity of the termination for cause and have challenged the contractual procedure followed by tcpl for termination for cause  which allows for a day notification period during which time we are supposed to have an opportunity to remedy the alleged default 
despite not being granted this time  we agreed in good faith to cooperate with tcpl in an orderly demobilization and handover of the remaining work 
as of december   we have outstanding receivables related to this project of million and unapproved change orders for additional work of million which have not been billed 
additionally  there are claims for additional fees totaling million 
it is our policy not to recognize revenue or income on unapproved change orders or claims until they have been approved 
accordingly  the million in pending change orders and the million of claims have been excluded from our revenue recognition 
the preceding balances are partially offset by an unissued billing credit of million related to a tcpl mobilization prepayment 
if the termination for cause is determined to be valid and enforceable  we could be held liable for damages resulting from the alleged breach of contract  including but not limited to costs incurred by tcpl to hire a replacement contractor to complete the remainder of the work less the cost that we would have incurred to perform the same scope of work 
although we do not believe we are in breach of contract and intend to pursue our contractual and legal remedies  including having commenced arbitration and filed liens on constructed facilities  the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
tcpl s response to the notice of arbitration included a counterclaim for damages of million for the alleged breach of contract  inclusive of the unissued billing credit of million for mobilization prepayment 
tcpl has also disclaimed responsibility for payment of the current receivable balance outstanding at december   the unapproved change orders  and claims for additional fee 
transcanada has removed us from transcanada s bid list 
our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients 
we operate primarily in the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  providing services to a limited number of clients 
much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients 
the loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
one client is responsible for percent of our month backlog and percent of our total backlog at december  our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenues are currently generated by fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon a defined scope  which includes specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  and we may incur a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts  whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 

table of contents in addition  our utility t d segment also generates substantial revenue under unit price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price  which have similar associated risks 
a unit can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation 
the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit 
failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses 
percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our operating results 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method on long term fixed price contracts 
under this method  estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved  and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised 
these estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience  and are only estimates 
variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material 
to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase  a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue  we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  our ability to raise capital or secure insurance  or our future growth 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the united states 
further  the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments may subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to a number of operational risks 
our business operations include pipeline construction  fabrication  pipeline rehabilitation services and construction and turnaround and maintenance services to refiners and petrochemical facilities 
these operations involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  equipment and the environment  and suspension of operations 
in locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others  our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage  loss of revenue  casualty loss  increased costs and significant liability to third parties 
the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
our goodwill may become impaired 
we have a substantial amount of goodwill following our acquisitions of infrastrux  integrated service company  midwest management ltd 
and wink companies  llc 
at least annually  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of each operating unit 
this estimated fair value could change if there were future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  capital expenditure levels or ability to perform at levels that were forecasted 
these changes could result in an impairment that would require a material non cash charge to our results of operations 
a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill 
we have continued to experience sustained adverse market conditions  primarily in our downstream market space 
during the third quarter of  in connection with the completion of the preliminary forecast for  it became evident that a goodwill impairment at downstream oil gas was probable 
as a result  a preliminary step one analysis for that segment was performed 
using a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair value of the segment versus its carrying value  an estimated range of likely impairment was determined and an impairment charge of  was recorded during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual evaluation of goodwill  which resulted in an additional  non cash  pre tax charge of  we will continue to monitor the carrying value of our goodwill 

table of contents we may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors 
some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties 
in addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work  where work is performed through a joint venture  we also have potential liability for the work performed by our joint ventures 
in these projects  even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget  we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of our joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications 
we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  nondestructive inspection and catering and security 
however  with respect to epc and other contracts  including those in our utility t d segment  we may choose to subcontract a portion or substantial portion of the project 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as a prime contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
governmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate  including those relating to currency conversion and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and earnings of our personnel  the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers  including  in some jurisdictions  mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets 
in addition  we depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  and  therefore  our business is affected by changing taxes  price controls and laws and regulations relating to these industries generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations by the countries or the states in which we operate that are intended to curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas or the development of electric power generation facilities for economic and other policy reasons  could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services 
our operations are also subject to the risk of changes in laws and policies which may impose restrictions on our business  including trade restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
other types of governmental regulation which could  if enacted or implemented  adversely affect our operations include expropriation or nationalization decrees  confiscatory tax systems  primary or secondary boycotts directed at specific countries or companies  embargoes  extensive import restrictions or other trade barriers  mandatory sourcing and local participation rules  stringent local registration or ownership requirements  oil  gas or electric power price regulation  unrealistically high labor rate and fuel price regulation  and registration and licensing requirements 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in  or new interpretations of  existing regulations  and the impact of these changes could be material 

table of contents our strategic plan relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our strategic plan involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including inherent difficulties relating to combining previously separate businesses  diversion of management s attention from ongoing day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including both foreseen and unforeseen liabilities  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services and systems of an acquired business and to integrating marketing  contracting  commercial and other operational disciplines  difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business  and failure to retain key or essential employees or customers of  or any government contracts held by  an acquired business 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition of infrastrux  which could cause our business to suffer 
our acquisition of infrastrux is significant 
infrastrux total assets account for approximately percent of our total assets as of december  we may not be able to successfully combine the operations  personnel and technology of infrastrux with our operations 
because of the size and complexity of infrastrux s business  if integration is not managed successfully by our management  we may experience interruptions in our business activities  a decrease in the quality of our services  a deterioration in our employee and customer relationships  increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we entered new lines of business when we acquired infrastrux that we do not have experience managing  such as the electrical transmission business 
particularly because we will have to learn how to manage new lines of business  the integration of infrastrux with our operations will require significant attention from management  which may decrease the time management will have to serve existing customers  attract new customers and develop new services and strategies 
we may also experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees 
the integration with infrastrux may also impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects 
we will have to actively strive to demonstrate to our existing customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in our standards or business focus 
the integration of infrastrux also involved a significant capital commitment  and the return that we achieve on any capital invested may be less than the return achieved on our other projects or investments 
there will be challenges in consolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures 
in addition  any delays or increased costs of combining the companies could adversely affect our operations  financial results and liquidity 
we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from our acquisition of infrastrux 
the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of infrastrux will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies 
our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies  and the timing of this realization  depends on the successful integration of infrastrux s business and operations with our business and operations 
even if we are able to integrate our business with infrastrux s business successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies we currently expect from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all 
for example  we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs 
moreover  we anticipate that we will incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of our business with infrastrux s business 
while we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred  such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately  and may exceed current estimates 
accordingly  the benefits from the proposed acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies  which could cause our revenue assumptions to be inaccurate 

table of contents the acquisition of infrastrux may expose us to unindemnified liabilities 
as a result of the recent acquisition  we acquired infrastrux subject to all of its liabilities  including contingent liabilities 
if there are unknown infrastrux obligations  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we may learn additional information about infrastrux s business that adversely affects us  such as unknown liabilities  issues that could affect our ability to comply with the sarbanes oxley act or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws 
as a result  we can provide no assurance that the acquisition of infrastrux will be successful or will not  in fact  harm our business 
among other things  if infrastrux s liabilities are greater than expected  or if there are material obligations of which we were not aware until after the time of completion of the acquisition  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
if we become responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification rights or substantially in excess of amounts covered through any indemnification rights  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
further  given the amount of indebtedness that we incurred to fund the acquisition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing required for any significant expenditures on favorable terms or at all 
we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies insurance 
our historical and pro forma combined financial information may not be representative of our results as a combined company 
the pro forma combined financial information that we file with the sec is constructed from the separate financial statements of willbros group  inc and infrastrux and does not purport to be indicative of the financial information that will result from operations of the combined companies 
in addition  the pro forma combined financial information that we file with the sec is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the acquisition that we believe are reasonable 
we cannot assure you that our assumptions will prove to be accurate over time 
accordingly  the historical and pro forma combined financial information that we file with the sec does not purport to be indicative of what our results of operations and financial condition would have been had we been a combined entity during the periods presented  or what our results of operations and financial condition will be in the future 
the challenge of integrating previously independent businesses makes evaluating our business and our future financial prospects difficult 
our potential for future business success and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by recently combined companies 
our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities 
our us and canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent 
we regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas  such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
part of the business in our utility t d segment is done in the southwestern us where there is a greater risk of fines  work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing native american artifacts and archeological sites 
significant fines  penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances  rendering a person liable for environmental damage  without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed 

table of contents we own and operate several properties in the united states and canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released 
any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  the resource compensation and recovery act rcra  and or analogous state  provincial or local laws 
cercla imposes joint and several liabilities  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment  while rcra governs the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
under these or similar laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property 
this could have a significant impact on our future results 
our operations outside of the united states and canada are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
we are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and or issued in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations  including those introduced or adopted in the future  would impact our business and operations  it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater compliance costs or operating restrictions for us and or our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services 
our industry is highly competitive  which could impede our growth 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
a substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals 
we compete for these projects against government owned or supported companies and other companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in some markets  there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price 
our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies 
the global recession has intensified competition in the industries in which we operate as our competitors in these industries pursue reduced work volumes 
our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures  greater resources or other advantages and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept 
we also face competition in new arenas resulting from our acquisition of infrastrux 
for example  in recent years our cable restoration business in our utility t d segment has begun to face increasing competition from alternative technologies 
our cablecure product sales may be adversely affected by technological improvements by one or more of our competitors and or the expiration of our exclusive intellectual property rights in such technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with current or future technological advances in cable restoration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

table of contents our operating results could be adversely affected if our non us operations became taxable in the united states 
if any income earned before our change of domicile in march by willbros group  inc or its non us subsidiaries from operations outside the united states constituted income effectively connected with a us trade or business  and as a result became taxable in the united states  our consolidated operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the services of our executive management 
our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management 
our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships 
our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients  stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team 
the infrastrux acquisition will further test our management team as we continue to absorb a significant new business without significantly expanding the size of our management team 
we also may not be able to retain infrastrux s operating unit managers  project managers and field supervisors  who are personnel that are critical to the continued growth of infrastrux s business 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals 
the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations 
our storm restoration revenues are highly volatile and unpredictable  which could result in substantial variations in  and uncertainties regarding  our results of operations generated by our utility t d business 
revenues derived from our storm restoration services are highly volatile and uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of weather related events 
infrastrux s annual storm restoration revenues have been as high as million in when infrastrux experienced the largest storm restoration revenues in its history as several significant hurricanes impacted the gulf coast and florida and ice storms affected the northeast  but storm restoration revenues were substantially lower in therefore  infrastrux s storm restoration revenues for are not indicative of the revenues that this business typically generates in any period or can be expected to generate in any future period 
our utility t d segment s revenues and operating income will likely continue to be subject to significant variations and uncertainties due to the volatility of our storm restoration volume 
we may not be able to generate incremental revenues from storm activities to the extent that we do not receive permission from our regular customers including oncor to divert resources to the restoration work for customers with which we do not have ongoing msa relationships  sometimes referred to in this form k as off system work 
in addition  our storm restoration revenues are offset in part by declines in our transmission and distribution t d services because we staff storm restoration mobilizations by diverting resources from our t d services 
seasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results  profitability  cash flow and working capital needs related to our utility t d segment 
we have not historically considered seasonality a significant risk  but because a significant portion of our business in our utility t d segment is performed outdoors  our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather 
our utility t d segment performs less work in the winter months  and work is hindered during other inclement weather events 
our utility t d segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete 
during periods of peak electric power demand in the summer  utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power t d equipment from service  decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods 
the seasonality of this segment s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate 
because this segment s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months  we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment s working capital during the spring and summer 
we depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in our cable restoration and testing businesses  and we cannot be certain of their confidentiality and protection 
our success in the cable restoration and testing markets depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and services

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise  either by us  a member of management or a major stockholder  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

table of contents in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions or to fund our corporate activities  we may dilute share ownership 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company 
our prior sale of common stock  warrants and convertible notes  and our outstanding warrants and convertible notes may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock 
in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock 
in october  we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of which  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock remained outstanding at december  
the issuance of warrants and the prior issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes and million of our senior convertible notes due the notes may cause a significant increase in the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding 
in may  we induced the conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes into a total of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  certain holders have exercised their right to convert the notes  converting approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes into  shares of our common stock as of december  as of december    shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and  shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
if we elect to induce the conversion of additional convertible notes or holders elect to convert additional convertible notes  there may be a significant increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
our authorized shares of common stock consist of million shares 
the issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  one million shares of preferred stock  which may give other stockholders dividend  conversion  voting and liquidation rights  among other rights  which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
while our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock  other than pursuant to any earnout payments that may be made in connection with our acquisition of infrastrux  it reserves the right to do so in the future

overview willbros is a global provider of engineering and construction services to the oil  gas  refinery  petrochemical and power industries with a focus on infrastructure such as oil gas pipeline systems  electric transmission and distribution t d services and refinery downstream markets 
our offerings include engineering  procurement and construction either individually or as an integrated epc service offering  turnarounds  maintenance and other specialty services 
year in review during  revenue decreased  percent to  from  in operating income  excluding special items decreased  percent to an operating loss of  from operating income of  in  and operating margin decreased percentage points to a negative percent in from an operating margin of percent in refer to the financial summary section included in this md a for further discussion and detail of our fourth quarter and full year operating results and for details on special items 
although market conditions started to improve during the year  we continued to be challenged by weaker demand for our services  which was compounded by poor visibility for the timing of both committed projects  as well as anticipated projects 
as a result  we found ourselves maintaining our operations at resource levels sufficient to initiate and complete these projects 
this situation resulted in a misalignment of our fixed costs as a result of the uncertain timing of revenues 
we also incurred upfront costs to invest in the future of the company by diversifying our end market exposure through the infrastrux acquisition and expanding our service offerings through opening new offices in the gas shale play areas to increase our presence in our customers work areas 
we believe these investments advance our strategy to diversify our end market exposure and to increase our revenue stream from recurring services 
growing our revenue stream associated with more recurring services will provide improved stability and predictability 
strategically  we are in the midst of a transformation 
we have successfully refocused our business model on north america  expanded our addressable markets to include significant exposure to the second largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world the oil sands in canada  the massive unconventional shale play developments in the us  the industrial process and refining market and the expansion and improvement of the north american electric utility grid 
we believe each of these markets carries with it significant recurring services opportunities 
our acquisition of infrastrux came with more costly debt than originally expected and substantial overhead and indirect costs 
the delays  which we discussed in our third quarter earnings call  also contributed to our loss position and reduced our financial flexibility 
for the projects that we have been awarded in our upstream and downstream businesses  the market remains highly competitive and we bid most of these projects with tighter margins  and results in canada were negatively impacted by delays and cost overruns on certain projects 

table of contents on the positive side  we had many successes 
we had good results on our major project execution in the united states  which can be highlighted by our superior performance executing the fayetteville express pipeline fep project  which we completed under budget and on schedule 
additionally  our upstream oil gas engineering unit exceeded its plan and our downstream oil gas segment improved its performance to better than breakeven in the second half of the year as we anticipated 
looking forward to as we move into  our number one priority is restoring our financial strength 
our management team is focused on four priority objectives reduce debt by approximately to million to significantly reduce interest expense and provide better financial flexibility 
this should translate more of our ebitda into earnings  maintain our focus on north america 
our presence in the canadian oil sands and the us electric transmission markets present the best growth opportunities for us 
this is where our key markets and resources come together to offer the best risk adjusted returns 
currently  we are not planning to pursue large international projects like we did in  continue to emphasize and improve our project management tools and capabilities 
we have large projects in backlog that can make a significant impact on our bottom line  and remain focused on safety 
our objective for the year is to reduce injuries by percent 
we differentiate willbros on this value both as an employer and as a provider of services 
these objectives overarch actions already underway including fully integrating infrastrux into willbros  adapting our upstream business to meet changing market conditions and execute the newly awarded and currently underway acadian project to the same standards as fep  reducing operating costs and creating efficiencies that will enhance our competitiveness and improve our bottom line  and continue moving our model to an operating company structure while fostering a common set of values and culture 
our primary financial objective is reducing our leverage position by paying down debt 
this requires us to modify some of our credit agreement covenants 
on march   we reached an agreement with our lenders to amend our credit agreement which will allow us to sell equipment  real estate and business units  and in most cases  proceeds from these divestitures would be required to pay down the term loan 
we are also continuing to evaluate under utilized and non strategic assets with the aim of monetizing assets to pay down debt 
in  we sold under utilized equipment with a net book value of  and to date in  we have identified additional properties and equipment with a net book value of  as part of this debt reduction process  we have a study underway to assist us in determining the strategic fit and potential future contributions of various business units 
the outcome of this study is expected to yield targets for divestment  which will contribute to our overall debt reduction objective 
we are focused on executing our plan  while concurrently identifying opportunities to reduce operating costs and create efficiencies that will enhance our competitiveness and improve our bottom line 
our overhead and indirect costs are too high to sustain our desired financial performance level in a weak market 
accordingly  we are in the process of identifying additional cost reduction opportunities 
we continue to audit our costs in all our segments  and we are encouraged that the new cost structure in our downstream oil gas has aided its return to profitability 
during  we expect to see continued improvement from each of our businesses 

table of contents our strategy as expanded upon in detail in items and business and properties of this form k  our vision is to be a leading provider to the global infrastructure and government services markets of diversified professional construction and maintenance solutions addressing the entire asset lifecycle 
adherence to our values of safety  honesty and integrity  our people  our customers  superior financial performance  vision and innovation and effective communication will guide us in the execution of our strategy which consists of the following stabilizing our revenue stream with recurring services  focusing on managing risk  leveraging our industry position and reputation into a broader service offering  maintaining financial flexibility  and leveraging our core service expertise into additional full epc contracts 
successfully executing our strategy will ensure that we are not only well positioned to address the challenges of  but also are positioned for success and to drive shareholder value for years to come 
significant developments fayetteville express project fep 
on april   we commenced work on the construction contract for spreads three and four of the fep project 
the approximately mile natural gas pipeline originates in conway county  arkansas  continues eastward through white county  arkansas  and terminates at an interconnection with trunkline gas company in panola county  mississippi 
fep parallels existing utility corridors  where possible  to minimize the impact to the environment  communities and landowners 
fep is a joint venture between energy transfer partners  lp and kinder morgan energy partners  lp our scope of work included miles of inch pipeline  beginning near bald knob  arkansas and ending at the trunkline interconnection 
this project concluded in the fourth quarter of williams energy canada boreal pipeline 
in june  our canadian business was awarded construction of the williams energy canada boreal pipeline 
the new inch diameter pipeline will transport high vapor pressure liquids approximately km from williams liquid extraction plant north of fort mcmurray to their redwater olefins facility northeast of edmonton  alberta 
construction will be completed in three construction seasons commencing in the fall of with final completion in the spring of this project commenced in the third quarter of infrastrux acquisition 
on july   we completed the acquisition of percent of the outstanding stock of infrastrux for a purchase price of approximately  before final working capital and other transaction adjustments 
this acquisition significantly diversifies our capabilities and end markets 
in addition to providing meaningful access to the attractive electric transmission and distribution market  the acquisition also expands the breadth of our natural gas capabilities and better positions us in targeted markets such as the marcellus shale play 
infrastrux and its results of operations in the electric transmission and distribution end markets are included in a newly established segment  utility t d 
any goodwill recognized through this transaction will be allocated to this segment  which will also be the reporting unit 
goodwill associated with this transaction is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
the acquisition of infrastrux diversifies our end market exposure while expanding our capabilities into attractive geographies  including the marcellus shale region where we are already expanding our presence and are providing services to a major alliance partner  and more liquids oriented plays such as the eagle ford and bakken shales 
the combination creates a higher component of recurring services and is expected to provide additional stability  through the many master service agreements msa infrastrux has in place  with longstanding client relationships  some as long as years 
in addition  we believe this acquisition will allow us to offer the complementary pipeline services of a larger infrastrux subsidiary that is focused on smaller diameter  distribution and pipe related field services 
we believe the market for pipeline systems construction services will be characterized by more projects of smaller scope and scale  and that the combination of our large diameter pipeline construction  project management and engineering expertise with the infrastrux model will better meet client needs and expectations going forward 
we also recognize market fundamentals which lead us to believe the national transmission grid in the united states will undergo significant expansion to meet reliability goals and link new  renewable generation with distant end markets 
our new utility t d segment should benefit from our established and proven project management systems as we apply them to major electric transmission line construction opportunities 
finally  this transaction significantly adds to our scale 
we believe customers today are favoring players with the capabilities to provide a broader and more integrated set of services 
with the larger geographic footprint  complementary service offerings and client bases  the infrastrux acquisition broadens our prospects with additional cross selling and integrated epc opportunities

there were no special items during full year results during  revenue decreased  percent to  from  in this decrease is primarily due to a reduction of large diameter pipeline projects in our upstream oil gas segment  exacerbated by delays in execution schedules on pipeline and facilities work in our canadian business  offset by  contributed by our newly acquired utility t d segment 
operating income  excluding special items  decreased  percent to an operating loss of  from operating income of  in  and operating margin decreased percentage points to a negative percent in from an operating margin of percent in the legacy segments  upstream oil gas and downstream oil gas  both experienced substantial year over year reductions to their operating results 
upstream oil gas decreased  or percent to  and downstream oil gas decreased  to a loss of  as compared to operating income of in these unfavorable variances reflect a full year of a very difficult economic cycle for the engineering and construction industry as compared to only a partial year in  compounded by significant project losses in our upstream oil gas canadian business previously discussed 
work carried forward from buffered the reduction to operating income in the first half of almost two thirds of s revenue of  occurred in the first six months of the year 
also contributing to the successive year operating loss was  in operating loss contributed by utility t d  representing six months of results for our new segment acquired july  the loss is attributable to a combination of a weak electric distribution business and large electric construction projects being delayed from into in addition  during  we incurred acquisitions costs of  an increase of  from  primarily from the pursuit and acquisition of infrastrux 
interest  net expense increased  percent to  from  in the increase in net expense is a direct result of the  term loan used to acquire infrastrux on july  other  net income increased  percent to  from in this change was primarily driven by approximately  in gains recognized on the sale of assets and  in certain goods and services tax gst refunds obtained in our canadian business 
we had  in gains on asset sales recognized  offset by in other net expense during 
table of contents the provision for income taxes for decreased  to a tax benefit of  on losses from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the decrease in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the decrease in operating income recognized during and no tax expense recognized in connection with the release of  of the contingent earnout liability associated with the acquisition of infrastrux

fourth quarter results in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share from continuing operations revenue of  as compared to net income of  from continuing operations revenue of  for the third quarter of excluding the fourth quarter special item of  or  after tax  the fourth quarter loss is reduced to  see the table above for a reconciliation of operating income and net income excluding special items 
the fourth quarter of s sequential quarter revenue was fairly consistent with the previous quarter 
the revenue decrease of  percent is primarily attributable to the mechanical completion of a large us pipeline project during the third quarter and the lack of us pipeline and power construction activity during the fourth quarter as this work returns to a more seasonal pattern of execution concentrated from early spring to late fall drier months 
these factors were offset by the commencement of two large pipeline projects and one facilities project during the fourth quarter of in our canadian business  which had minimal project revenue in the third quarter of and follows a seasonal pattern from late fall to early spring 
the corresponding sequential quarter decrease in operating income was  percent 
the fourth quarter of had an operating loss of  versus operating income of  in the third quarter of excluding the special items  the sequential quarter decrease is  and is primarily the result of limited work by the higher margin us pipeline operations 
although the us pipeline revenue loss was partially made up by canada pipeline and facilities projects  the recognized canada margins were minimal 
two canada projects reverted to loss projects in the fourth quarter because of schedule and adverse weather delays 
the operating margins  excluding special items  for the fourth quarter and third quarter of were negative percent and positive percent  respectively 
other financial measures backlog in our industry  backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance as it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
our strategy is focused on capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project  and for the past several years we have put processes and procedures in place to identify contractual and execution risks in new work opportunities and believe we have instilled in the organization the discipline to price  accept and book only work which meets stringent criteria for commercial success and profitability 
we believe the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts 
additionally  due to the short duration of many jobs  revenue associated with jobs performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports 
we generate revenue from numerous sources  including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes  including change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work 
these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured 
backlog broadly consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured 
historically  our backlog has only included estimated work under msas for a period of months or the remaining term of the contract  whichever is less 
however  with the july acquisition of infrastrux  we gained a significant alliance agreement with oncor and other customers with work defined by msas 
under the oncor msa  we are the preferred contractor for the construction of oncor s portion of the competitive renewable energy zone crez work that is scheduled to be completed in we expect this assignment to generate over million in construction revenue for our utility t d segment over the next three years 
with this as the primary catalyst  we have updated our backlog presentation to reflect not only the month msa work estimate  but also the full term value of the contract as we believe that this information is helpful in providing additional long term visibility 
we determine the amount of backlog for work under ongoing msa maintenance and construction contracts by using recurring historical trends inherent in the msas  factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer 
we also include in backlog our share of work to be performed under contracts signed by joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 

table of contents at december   month backlog from continuing operations increased  percent to  from  at december   driven primarily by an additional  of month backlog contributed by the newly acquired utility t d segment 
the upstream oil gas segment  with a month backlog of  also contributed to the overall rise in backlog by increasing  or from the month backlog level 
these increases were offset by a decrease in the downstream oil gas segment month backlog of  or 
in our upstream oil gas segment  month backlog increased  from driven primarily by our canadian and engineering businesses  which experienced year over year increases of  and  respectively 
this was offset  however  by a decrease of  in all other business units primarily due to the completion of our largest pipeline construction project  fep  not replaced with equivalently sized work in the latter part of our pipeline construction services contracting has experienced a return to a historical north america contracting model that is characterized by competitive fixed price bids and short time periods from project bid to execution  except for large epc contracts that can span more than one year 
with the return to historical contracting patterns  we expect to experience lower backlog numbers partially as a result of eliminating the much longer lead times between the award of and the execution of projects 
the downstream oil gas segment continued to experience a slower than expected return to business levels realized in during  turnaround work continued to be completed faster than new work was added 
in our utility t d segment  six customer relationships are expected to contribute  in revenue during as previously discussed  a significant portion of the utility t d backlog is associated with recurring services on msa contracts that extend beyond when factoring in the backlog beyond the current months  an additional  in revenue is anticipated 
msa agreements account for  of this amount 
the remaining  is attributable to current lump sum projects in the upstream oil gas and utility t d segments 
the utility t d segment currently accounts for  of the reported msa backlog beyond months and is derived from agreements extending until july of the remaining  is associated with upstream oil gas segment msa work and is primarily comprised of work from a single canada msa extending through and valued at  backlog for discontinued operations was at december  and  at december  the following table shows our backlog by operating segment as of december  and as of december  month percent total percent month percent total percent upstream oil gas downstream oil gas utility t d total backlog ebitda and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations we use ebitda earnings before net interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as part of our overall assessment of financial performance by comparing ebitda between accounting periods 
we believe that ebitda is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in businesses similar to ours 

table of contents ebitda from continuing operations for decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease in ebitda during is primarily a result of the  change in fair value of the contingent earnout liability recognized in the third quarter of and an overall decrease in restructuring costs of  offset by decreased contract income of  excluding depreciation and an increase in g a of  excluding depreciation 
in addition to ebitda  management uses adjusted ebitda for comparing normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry  and presentations made to analysts  investment banks and other members of the financial community who use this information in order to make investment decisions about us 
adjustments to ebitda broadly consist of items which management does not consider representative of the ongoing operations of the company 
these generally include costs or benefits that are unusual  non cash or one time in nature 
these adjustments are included in various performance metrics under our credit facilities and other financing arrangements 
the ebitda adjustments to determine adjusted ebitda are itemized in the following table 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as  or similar to  some of the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not financial measurements recognized under us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income  operating income  or any other performance measure derived in accordance with us gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
because all companies do not use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies

table of contents discontinued operations for the year ended december   loss from discontinued operations was  or per share 
this compares to a loss from discontinued operations of  or per share for the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations is primarily due to the classification of our libyan operations as discontinued operations as of december  our investment in establishing a presence in libya  while resulting in contract awards  has not yielded any notice to proceed on subject awards  and we have  therefore  exited this market due to the delays and identification of other more attractive opportunities

results of operations our contract revenue and contract costs are significantly impacted by the capital budgets of our clients and the timing and location of development projects in the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and power industries worldwide 
contract revenue and cost vary by country from year to year as the result of entering and exiting work countries  the execution of new contract awards  the completion of contracts  and the overall level of demand for our services 
our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors  our clients and our work locations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue decreased  percent to  from  a year to year comparison of revenue is as follows year ended december  increase percent decrease change upstream oil gas downstream oil gas utility t d  n a  total upstream oil gas revenue decreased  percent to  from  in we believe the decrease in revenue was the result of our customers reduction in capital and maintenance spending in as a continued reaction to the overall global economic recession 
this was evidenced by an overall decrease in large diameter pipeline projects available for bid 
further  projects that were initially being bid for completion were postponed or cancelled 
as a result of these conditions  the segment began to pursue midstream pipeline projects which opened a new market in one of the major regional shale plays 
this market generated  in revenue for 
table of contents us in the engineering business also contributed higher than expected revenues of  as a result of developing alliances 
overall  our north american upstream oil gas business units experienced revenue decreases from percent to percent 
the sole business unit to grow revenue year over year was in oman  where revenue grew percent driven by maintenance services 
the majority of our revenue percent was awarded and executed in  with the largest exception being the fep project that was awarded for approximately  in and executed in this marks a return to the business environment where we expect short lead times between award and execution for our construction projects in the united states 
our us business units revenues decreased  percent to  from  in this was primarily due to reduced utilization of large diameter cross country pipeline construction assets of  and a reduction of pipeline facility construction work of  we believe the reduction of pipeline construction revenue was directly linked to the reduced capital budgets approved and executed by our core customer base in we believe the reduction of facility construction revenue was also impacted by significantly reduced capital budgets for our core customers 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from our regional pipeline construction activity of  and increased revenue from our engineering services of  we believe the increased demand for our engineering services  while modest at percent  demonstrates a turning point in the market for front end design work for gas and liquid transportation systems which is the precursor to construction of these systems 
our canada business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease was primarily due to reduced capital budgets of the oil sand producers and pipeline companies  driven by uncertain crude pricing 
revenue from our pipeline construction group decreased  revenue from our field services group declined  and revenue from our facility construction group declined  our oman business unit revenue increased  percent to  from  in this increase was largely attributable to increased work order activity from our largest customers for which we provide both capital construction and maintenance services 
downstream oil gas revenue increased primarily as a result of increased maintenance and turnaround activity and development of downstream services in canada 
we experienced revenue increases of percent to percent in several of our business units and revenue decreases from percent to percent in our other business units 
revenue increased quarter over quarter throughout as we worked off existing backlog from and filled in the year with new contract awards 
our construction services business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in while this business unit has maintained a consistent level of consulting services for our customers long term capital expansion projects  our involvement in the physical construction of these projects has decreased from six projects in to one project in our consulting services arrangements were largely negotiated in prior years for projects that are still ongoing 
new capital project activity and construction opportunities relating to our consulting services have decreased since the latter part of our manufacturing services business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in  primarily due to a percent decrease in revenue from fabrication of process heaters 
as capital spending by our customers decreased throughout  we worked off existing backlog but were unable to replace that work in as our customers capital budgets increase  we fully expect that the demand for process heaters will increase 
partially offsetting the revenue decline from fabrication of process heaters was a percent increase in revenue from fabrication of replacement transfer lines  which represents maintenance expenditures for our customers 
our tank services business unit revenue increased  percent to  from  in our and investments in expanding tank services into canada resulted in our first contract award in we realized revenue of  from this contract in and are actively pursuing additional contract awards in canada 
services provided in the us consisted of less new tank construction than in previous years as a result of decreased capital spending by our customers in and early we were able to win additional tank inspection and repair work in to offset the decrease in new tank construction awards 
proposal requests from our customers for new tank construction projects increased during the latter half of  resulting in several multiple tank construction contract awards that began in late 
table of contents our maintenance and turnaround business unit revenue increased  percent to  from  in we benefited in from our position as a contractor of choice for our customers maintenance and turnaround needs  the impact of delayed maintenance activities in  and our investments in equipment to provide exchanger tube bundle extraction services 
our engineering business unit revenue increased  percent to  from  in we experienced a  increase in revenue resulting from a full year of activity for downstream engineering  acquired in july engineering revenue declined during the latter half of as several significant contracts were completed 
bid activity on new capital work remains high 
however  we continue to experience customer imposed delays on awarded contracts 
the decline in engineering revenue during the latter half of was partially offset by the award of an epc contract from an existing customer in texas 
this project began late in the third quarter of we continue to market our epc service offering to new and existing customers 
our government services business unit revenue increased  percent to  from  in this resulted primarily from the reclassification of government services from the upstream oil gas segment to the downstream oil gas segment in july we were successful in winning nine task orders from the us navy under the engineering service center s idiq contract  six of which commenced during the second half of and will continue into we continue to bid on task orders under this contract as they are released 
utility t d  a new segment  resulting from the acquisition of infrastrux  contributed revenue of  as a result of revenues derived from a broad range of transmission and distribution construction and maintenance services from july  through december  this segment includes the business units of hawkeye  chapman construction  and willbros t d  which accounted for   and  respectively  or of the segment s total revenue 
hawkeye s contract revenue is driven primarily by msa contracts related to overhead and underground transmission  distribution and telecommunication systems 
the business generated revenue of  for the six months ended december  as a direct result of established msas 
these agreements vary in length from one month to three years 
chapman generated  or of the business units revenue through an alliance agreement with oncor providing turnkey transmission and substation construction and maintenance solutions 
willbros t d produced  or of that business unit s revenue through an alliance agreement with oncor to provide overhead and underground utility construction services 
operating income operating income decreased  percent to a loss of  from income of  in a year to year comparison of operating income is as follows operating operating percent margin margin change change upstream oil gas downstream oil gas utility t d  n a n a  total this table does not reflect change in fair value of contingent earnout consideration of  in which is included in operating results 
the change in fair value of contingent earnout consideration was characterized as a corporate change in estimate and is not allocated to the reporting segments 
upstream oil gas operating income decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease was caused by reduced revenue across the segment  as noted above 
our operating margin was consistent year over year primarily due to improved project margins in the united states partially offset by reduced margins in canada as well as increased general and administrative g a expense as a percent of revenue  across the segment 
the increased g a was primarily attributed to increased proposal activity as well as growth initiatives expanding our regional service delivery capabilities 
operating income for our united states business units decreased percent to  from  in our operating income remained constant in spite of significant revenue declines of for these businesses 
our construction business suffered the most from revenue decline  but our focus on execution of the available work allowed us to improve our contract margins and still deliver strong operating income at a significantly smaller volume 
this continued profitability came as we saw the market shift back fully to lump sum contracting terms  marking the end of the cost reimbursable work that we completed in for large diameter cross country pipeline construction 
our engineering business experienced a much more modest revenue decline  but had a significant improvement in profitability 
in  our engineering business had significant operating losses  which were reversed in to significant operating income due to stronger market demand for our services and active cost management 

table of contents operating income for our canada business unit decreased  percent to a loss of  from income of  in this decrease was primarily caused by loss projects in our pipeline and facility construction groups  compounded by the reduction of recurring oil sands maintenance contracts in northern alberta 
the four lump sum projects that were in a loss position as of year end accounted for approximately  of contract losses 
in  we were awarded a multiple year extension for our maintenance work for syncrude in canada 
operating income for our oman business unit increased percent to  from  in the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to a revenue increase which we feel is driven by our long term recurring service contracts with key customers in oman 
these recurring services helped to insulate this business unit from the constraints of capital spending that we experienced in other parts of our business in operating losses for our other international business units decreased percent to a loss of  from a loss of  in these costs are primarily related to international new business development and pursuing new opportunities  as well as the proposal costs associated with submitting multiple qualified international bids in places like libya and australia in downstream oil gas operating income decreased primarily as a result of the  goodwill impairment charge taken in the third and fourth quarters of and the previously discussed decreases in revenue from our manufacturing services and construction services business units  as well as operating losses contributed by our engineering business unit  and tank services business unit 
our maintenance and turnaround business unit contributed an operating loss for the year that was driven largely by a loss on a fixed price contract early in the year 
contract margins declined in each business unit during these declines were caused by continued pricing pressure from our customers and a more competitive bidding environment 
as a result  our fixed price bids and our rates on cost reimbursable projects subsequently awarded and performed during reflected lower margins 
these lower bid margins  combined with losses experienced on several contracts  resulted in contract margin decreases of percent in tank services  percent in manufacturing services  and percent in maintenance and turnaround services 
contract margins for the downstream oil gas segment decreased percent  driven primarily by these three business units 
as part of our continuing effort to decrease costs in this segment and remain competitive in our market  we successfully reduced indirect contract costs and g a costs by  and  respectively  compared to included in operating costs is in costs associated with headcount reductions 
the utility t d segment generated an operating loss of  the segment incurred costs totaling  of which non recurring acquisition costs of  and restructuring fees of  associated with the seattle office closure were recorded for the six months ended december  other significant costs charged to the segment were labor of  and depreciation of  the willbros t d business experienced an operating loss of  as a result of lower volumes and a shift in the mix in transmission construction revenues associated with the oncor work in texas  resulting in a heavier mix of lower margin work 
in addition  these lower volumes and delays created an underutilization of equipment 
for the six months ended december   willbros t d incurred equipment rental expense of  and depreciation expense of  associated with an underutilized fleet 
hawkeye reported an operating loss of  primarily due to the project delays experienced in the northeast both of which are currently underway  and in general a weaker market for electric and gas distribution work 
in addition  depreciation costs on an underutilized fleet were  partially offsetting the operating losses were utilx with operating income of  and chapman with operating income of  utilx s international operations performed well due to cablewise projects in europe and increased royalty revenue 
chapman provided operating income despite a shift in the mix of transmission construction revenue associated with the crez build out 

table of contents non operating items interest  net expense increased  percent to  from  in the increase in net expense is primarily a result of increased interest expense of  related to the new term loan  debt issuance cost amortization of  related to the credit agreement and a reduction in interest income of  due to lower levels of and rates of return on invested cash 
other  net income increased  percent to a net income of  from net income of in the increase in income is attributed to increased gains on the sale of assets of  in as compared to  a reduction in expense of  related to asset write downs taken in  in income recorded in the second quarter of as a result of a refund of gst based on certain deductions made in  and a reduction in foreign exchange losses of on us dollar to canadian dollar transactions 
provision for income taxes decreased  percent to a benefit of  from a provision of  in during  we recognized a tax benefit of  on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to income tax expense of  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the decrease in the provision for income taxes is due to the decrease in operating income recognized during and no tax expense incurred in connection with the release of the contingent earnout liability in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of infrastrux 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes increased percent to a loss of  from a loss of  in as of december   we classified our libyan operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our investment in establishing a presence in libya  while resulting in contract awards  has not yielded any notice to proceed on subject awards  and we have therefore exited this market due to the delays and identification of other more attractive opportunities 
our loss from discontinued operations related to libya was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the loss during the twelve months ended december  is also related to the legal fees incurred in connection with the previously discussed wapco parent company guarantee assertions 
the legal fees are expected to escalate and continue over the next several years 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the likely total legal fees 
the change is also related to a  charge taken during the second quarter of to write off the net book value of the note related to the venezuela sale  as management determined it unlikely to collect due to the nationalization of various oil contractors within the country 

table of contents fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue decreased  percent to  from  primarily due to decreased upstream oil gas revenue  although downstream oil gas did incur a significant percentage decrease in revenue 
a year to year comparison of revenue is as follows year ended december  percent decrease change upstream oil gas downstream oil gas total upstream oil gas revenue decreased  percent to  from  in we believe the decrease in revenue was the result of our customers reduction in capital and maintenance spending in as a reaction to the overall global economic recession 
at each of our upstream oil gas business units  we experienced revenue decreases from percent to nearly percent 
the majority of our revenue percent was earned in the first six months of as we worked off existing backlog from our us construction business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in this was primarily due to reduced utilization of large diameter cross country pipeline construction assets of  and a reduction of pipeline construction epc work of  we believe both of these reductions were directly linked to the reduced capital budgets of our primary client base for this business 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from our facility construction group of  and increased revenue from our manage maintain group of  the facility construction revenue was primarily attributable to one large project that included the construction of seven pump stations 
our canada business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease was primarily due to reduced capital budgets of the oil sand producers and pipeline companies  driven by the decline in crude oil prices year over year and the production costs associated with the oil sands 
revenue from our pipeline construction group decreased  additionally  our long term contracts for recurring maintenance at the oil sand production facilities generated  less in revenue in our us engineering business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in revenue from core engineering services declined  reflecting the significant drop off in market demand for front end design work for gas and liquid transportation systems 
the epc component of our offering  which declined  was affected by reduced capital expenditure budgets combined with owners increasing their risk tolerance associated with managing multiple aspects of these large projects 
our oman business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in this decrease was largely due to reduced work order activity of  from our primary client  to whom we provide both capital construction and maintenance services 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase of  in our rig moving services 
downstream oil gas revenue decreased  percent to  from  in  primarily as the result of declining construction revenue from capital projects 
the decline in refining profit margins slowed the release of capital projects by our customers 
as a result  while we continued to complete capital contracts awarded in and early  we were not able to replace them to the same extent as in the prior year 
construction services revenue decreased  percent to  primarily due to the completion of a major epc project early in  which was a significant source of construction services revenue in tank construction revenue decreased  percent to  the slow release of capital projects has increased competition and impacted the volume of contract awards that we have been able to obtain in both of these business units in the decline in profit margins in in the refining industry also resulted in the delay of several maintenance and turnaround projects from into this caused maintenance and turnaround revenue to decrease  percent to

with fewer prospects available in  the competition for each project grew  forcing us to reduce margin expectations across the segment 
our contract margins for were lower than at three of our four primary business units  suffering declines from percentage points to percentage points 
the only business unit that improved contract income  year over year  was our us construction group  which improved percentage points 
in  we focused on reducing our overhead expenses to remain competitive in a market with fewer opportunities 
these efforts resulted in a reduction of our total g a costs of  in as a percent of segment revenue  g a costs represented percent  although this was an increase as compared to the equivalent percent in g a costs reductions lagged behind the percent revenue decline in operating income for our us construction business unit decreased  percent to  from  in while operating income was down  operating margin was steady year over year  increasing percentage point to percent from percent in in the face of increased competition and an overall weaker economy  this performance helped support the upstream oil gas segment 
while this business unit was able to improve contract margin year over year  this improvement did not offset the impact to operating income associated with the revenue decline of percent 
contract margin improvement was largely driven by two key factors  the completion of the midcontinent express pipeline project  a large multi spread cost reimbursable pipeline project  and the successful transition to and completion of tips  a lump sum two spread pipeline construction project 
tips performance exceeded expectations and contributed to the slight year over year margin improvement 
by comparison  our contract margin was largely attributable to two large multi spread pipeline construction projects with cost reimbursable terms  southeast supply header sesh and mep 
the cost reimbursable nature of these jobs ensured our profitability  but negatively impacted margin as the size of the projects increased revenue while our profit opportunity remained fixed 
these projects were also offset by smaller lump sum pipeline construction projects that did not perform to the as bid expectations 
we reduced our us construction g a costs by  in operating income for our canada business unit decreased  percent to  from  in this decrease was primarily caused by the reduction of revenue associated with our pipeline construction group in canada 
pipeline construction revenue decreased percent year over year 
in  our two largest pipeline construction projects generated  of revenue  compared to our two largest projects in which generated  this significant decrease was representative of the overall reduction of oil sands related pipeline construction projects in canada 
our maintenance and fabrication services were relatively constant year over year  providing some insulation from the cyclical pipeline construction market 
we reduced our canada g a costs by  in operating income for our us engineering business unit decreased  percent to a loss of  from income of  in a continuing reduction of our work load resulted in reduced utilization of resources throughout the year  and in response we initiated several reductions of force to match the resource base to the available work

these decreases were partially offset by a reduction of overall business unit g a costs of operating income for our other international business units decreased  percent to a loss of  from a loss of  in these costs are primarily related to international new business development and pursuing new opportunities  as well as the proposal costs associated with submitting multiple qualified bids 
downstream oil gas operating income increased  percent to from a loss of  in  primarily from the  impairment charge taken in this increase is partially offset by an operating income decrease of  caused primarily by the previously discussed revenue variances  as well as declining margins across most business units 
construction services operating income decreased  percent to primarily as a result of the slow release of capital work 
tank services operating income decreased  percent to due to the slow release of capital work and fewer fixed price contract awards  which traditionally result in higher margins  in as compared to the reduction in fixed price work was caused by pricing pressures from our customers and also contributed to the  percent reduction in maintenance and turnaround operating income 
downstream engineering operating income decreased  to a loss of  as a result of our acquisition of wink in july downstream oil gas incurred  in other charges in  of which  occurred in the engineering business unit almost entirely related to lease impairment charges taken on wink s leased office space 
non operating items interest  net expense decreased percent to  from  in the decrease in net expense is the result of a decrease in interest expense of  primarily due to decreased capital lease obligations as a result of buy outs during the second quarter of  offset by  of decreased interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents due to declining interest rates throughout other  net income decreased  percent to a net income of from net income of  in the decrease was primarily a result of selling one of our fabrication facilities located in edmonton  alberta  canada  which resulted in a gain on sale of  during provision for income taxes decreased  percent to  from  in during  we recognized  of income tax expense on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to income tax expense of  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the decrease in the provision for income taxes is due to the decrease in operating income recognized during and a decrease in effective tax rate primarily due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes decreased  percent to a loss of  from income of in during  a  charge to write off the net book value of a note receivable related to the sale of our venezuela assets and operations was recorded 
management determined the collection of this outstanding commitment was highly unlikely due to nationalization of various oil field service contractors within the country 
the income recognized during the same period in was the result of two pre nigeria sale insurance claim recoveries totaling  for events of loss we suffered prior to the sale of our nigeria operations 
additionally  as of december  we classified our libyan operations as discontinued operations 
we recognized a loss from discontinued operations related to libya of  and  respectively for the years ended december   and 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our financing objective is to maintain financial flexibility to meet the material  equipment and personnel needs to support our project commitments  and pursue our expansion and diversification objectives  while reducing debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  our cash and cash equivalent balances held in the united states and foreign countries were  and  respectively 
we have analyzed our operations in all jurisdictions and while our current operating strategy is to reinvest any earnings of operations internationally rather than to distribute dividends to the us parent or its us affiliates  we are continually evaluating the use of cash available in our foreign subsidiaries for use to pre pay debt 
no dividends were paid from foreign operations to willbros group  inc or its domestic subsidiaries during at this time  there are other avenues available to management to consider for pre payment of debt and the likelihood that cash would be repatriated from foreign operations is low 
we are also able to secure funds from a three year revolving credit facility of  that was established primarily to provide letters of credit 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and  of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility  leaving remaining capacity of  our ability to use the credit facility for revolving loans  however  has been restricted as a result of the amendment to the credit facility in march of as discussed below 
during  our working capital position for continuing operations decreased by  percent to  from  at december  this was primarily the result of a significant reduction in income from continuing operations due to a reduction of large diameter pipeline projects in our upstream oil gas segment  amplified by delays in execution schedules on pipeline and facilities work in our canadian business  offset by additional working capital associated with our new utility t d segment in the second half of our overall cash balance has been negatively impacted by an ongoing contract dispute with transcanada 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional background information 
as of december   we have  of unpaid transcanada receivables 
we have submitted this dispute to arbitration for resolution  however  final resolution may not occur for a year or more 
we have not established a collectability reserve  and we believe adequate financial reserves are available during the interim period prior to receiving payment 
additional sources and uses of capital credit facility concurrent with our acquisition of infrastrux  we entered into the credit agreement dated june   that consists of a four year   term loan maturing in july and a three year revolving credit facility of  maturing in july and replaced our existing three year  senior secured credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in november the proceeds from the term loan were used to pay part of the cash portion of the merger consideration payable in connection with our acquisition of infrastrux 
see note long term debt in item of this form k for further discussion of the credit facility 
our credit agreement and the senior convertible notes for debt incurrence test only contain various provisions that require us to  among other things  comply with the following requirements in which we were in compliance as of december  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum total leverage ratio  minimum tangible net worth  debt incurrence test  minimum consolidated ebitda and a minimum cash balance during the interim period  limitations on capital expenditures during the interim period   and the greater of  or of ebtida thereafter  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on liens  limitations on certain asset sales and dispositions  and limitations on certain acquisitions and asset purchases if certain liquidity levels are not maintained 

table of contents our credit agreement  convertible senior notes and senior convertible notes contain default and cross default provisions 
an event of default under the credit agreement would permit cr dit agricole and the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding cash advances with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
an event of default under the convertible senior notes and senior convertible notes would require an accelerated payment of such notes before the scheduled date of maturity 
events of default in the credit agreement  convertible senior notes  or the senior convertible notes may trigger cross default provisions under these debt instruments 
events of default under the credit agreement  convertible senior notes and senior convertible notes may include  but are not limited to  covenant breaches that are not waived or cured  a failure to make scheduled payments of interest or principal of any debt obligation greater than a certain amount  a change in control of the company or certain insolvency proceedings 
our credit agreement was amended on march  the amendment 
the amendment allows us to make certain dispositions of equipment  real estate and business units 
in most cases  proceeds from these dispositions would be required to pay down the existing term loan made pursuant to the credit agreement 
financial covenants and associated definitions  such as consolidated ebitda  were also amended to permit us to carry out our business plan and to clarify the treatment of certain items 
we have agreed to limit our revolver borrowings under the credit agreement to  with the exception of proceeds from revolving borrowings used to make any payments in respect of the convertible senior notes  until our total leverage ratio is to or less 
however  the amendment does not change the limit on obtaining letters of credit 
the amendment also modifies the definition of excess cash flow to include proceeds from the transcanada pipeline arbitration  which would require us to use all or a portion of such proceeds to further pay down the existing term loan in the following fiscal year of receipt 
for prepayments made with net debt proceeds or equity issuance proceeds as those terms are defined in the credit agreement  the amendment requires a prepayment premium of of the principal amount of the term loans prepaid before december  and of the principal amount of the term loans prepaid on and after december  but before december  premiums for prepayments made with proceeds other than net debt proceeds or equity issuance proceeds remain the same as set forth under the credit agreement 
in connection with the amendment  we incurred fees of  and related to lender fees and third party legal costs  respectively  in the first quarter of based on the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard on debt modifications  we have capitalized lender fees and will amortize them over the three and four year terms of the revolving credit facility and term loan  respectively 
based on the same standard  the third party legal fees were expensed as incurred during the first quarter of cash flows statements of cash flows for entities with international operations that use the local currency as the functional currency exclude the effects of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during any given period  as these are non cash charges 
as a result  changes reflected in certain accounts on the consolidated statements of cash flows may not reflect the changes in corresponding accounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  working capital excluding discontinued operations of  and long term obligations of  net of current maturities 
these long term obligations consist of  on the term loan and  related to the notes  which have an aggregate principal amount of operating activities cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services  operating margins and the type of services we provide  but can also be influenced by working capital needs such as the timing of collection of receivables and the settlement of payables and other obligations 
working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months when the majority of our capital intensive projects are executed 
conversely  working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months 
operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash to us of  during as compared to  during and  during the slight increase in operating cash flows in as compared to is due primarily to an increase in cash flow provided by working capital accounts of  this increase was driven primarily by improvement of our cash collection efforts during the fourth quarter of as evidenced by our reduction in days sales outstanding from days at december  to days at december  this increase can also be attributed to a greater focus on our overall working capital management by aligning payments on obligations with current contractual arrangements 
this was almost entirely offset by an increase in the cash consumed by continuing operations of  net of non cash effects  which includes a  goodwill impairment charge and a  reduction in the contingent earnout liablity 

table of contents investing activities during  we used net cash in investing activities of  as compared to  and  used in investing activities in and  respectively 
investing activities in included  used for capital expenditures  offset by  of proceeds from the sale of under utilized equipment 
the newly acquired utility t d segment contributed capital expenditures of   of net cash used for the third quarter acquisition of infrastrux 
 in net cash provided from the maturities of short term investments during during and  we used  and  respectively  for capital expenditures  offset by  and  of proceeds from the sale of equipment 
the decrease in capital expenditures of  in compared to is related primarily to a significant purchase of large construction equipment made during we monitor our real estate  fleet and equipment size and utilization  and to the extent both financially and operationally beneficial  we actively seek potential buyers or renters of such equipment in order to limit our financial exposure resulting from their under utilization 
in  we began a process of analyzing all under utilized property and equipment and adopted a plan to dispose of such assets 
in december  we completed the sale of equipment having a net book value of  receiving proceeds of  in addition  we have committed to a plan of disposal of additional properties and equipment having a carrying value of  these assets are expected to be sold in and have been separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the caption assets held for sale 
financing activities in  financing activities provided net cash of  as compared to  and  used by financing activities in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from  in net proceeds after the  original issue discount provided from the term loan issued in connection with the funding of the infrastrux acquisition  and  in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock which was used to fund the purchase of infrastrux  offset by additional debt issuance costs of  for the new credit facility and term loan completed concurrently with our acquisition of infrastrux 
net cash used by financing activities in and resulted primarily from payments made on capital leases as well as government fines of  and  for and  and  for  respectively 
discontinued operations net cash from discontinued operations used  in as compared to  used in this resulted primarily from additional g a costs incurred related to our libyan operations in as compared to as well as additional legal fees incurred related to our ongoing wapco parent company guarantee assertions 
in  our net cash from discontinued operations provided cash to us of  which was primarily the result of two pre nigeria sale insurance claim recoveries of  that more than offset the loss incurred related to our libyan operations in the same period 
capital requirements during   of cash was provided by our continuing operations activities 
capital expenditures by segment amounted to  spent by upstream oil gas  for downstream oil gas   for utility t d  and  by corporate  for a total of  approved capital spending of has been carried forward to 
table of contents we believe that our financial results combined with our current liquidity  financial management and the credit facility  as amended and previously discussed  will ensure sufficient cash to meet our capital requirements for continuing operations 
as such  we are focused on the following significant capital requirements providing working capital for projects in process and those scheduled to begin in  funding of our capital budget of approximately  inclusive of of carry forward from  redeeming of  of our notes see contractual obligations below  and making the final installment payment to the government related to fines and profit disgorgement 
we believe that we will be able to support our ongoing working capital needs through our cash on hand  operating cash flows  sales of idle and under utilized equipment and potentially  the previously discussed credit facility 
contractual obligations as of december   we had  of outstanding debt related to our term loan and  of outstanding debt related to the convertible notes 
in addition  we have various capital leases of construction equipment and property resulting in aggregate capital lease obligations of  at december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years term loan convertible notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations equipment financing obligations contingent earnout government obligations uncertain tax liabilities total the holders of the notes had the right to require us to purchase the notes for cash  including unpaid interest  on december  none of the notes were surrendered for purchase pursuant to this put option 
accordingly  the notes remain outstanding as of december  and continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the notes 
following the expiration of the put option  an aggregate principal amount of  remains outstanding net of discount and has been classified as long term and included within long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at december  based on information received from bokf  na dba bank of texas  as paying agent for the notes  we announced on march   that all of the notes  with an aggregate principal amount of  were validly surrendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the option of the holders of the notes to require us to purchase on march   all or a portion of such holders notes 
we will use our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of the notes and the remaining unamortized discount of will be expensed during the first quarter of in connection with the acquisition of infrastrux on july   infrastrux shareholders are eligible to receive earnout payments of up to  if certain ebitda targets are met 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a  adjustment to the estimated fair value of the contingent earnout liability 
this change in estimated contingent earnout liability to the former infrastrux shareholders was due to a third quarter decrease in the probability weighted estimated achievement of ebitda targets as set forth in the merger agreement 
accordingly   in contingent earnout liability is presented as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents at december   we had uncertain tax positions which ultimately could result in a tax payment 
as the amount of the ultimate tax payment is contingent on the tax authorities assessment  it is not practical to present annual payment information 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility and there were  in outstanding letters of credit 
all outstanding letters of credit relate to continuing operations 
we have unsecured credit facilities with banks in certain countries outside the united states 
borrowings under these lines  in the form of short term notes and overdrafts  are made at competitive local interest rates 
generally  each line is available only for borrowings related to operations in a specific country 
credit available under these facilities is approximately  at december  there were no outstanding borrowings at december  or off balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments from time to time  we enter into commercial commitments  usually in the form of commercial and standby letters of credit  surety bonds and financial guarantees 
contracts with our customers may require us to provide letters of credit or surety bonds with regard to our performance of contracted services 
in such cases  the commitments can be called upon in the event of our failure to perform contracted services 
likewise  contracts may allow us to issue letters of credit or surety bonds in lieu of contract retention provisions  in which the client withholds a percentage of the contract value until project completion or expiration of a warranty period 
the letters of credit represent the maximum amount of payments we could be required to make if these letters of credit are drawn upon 
additionally  we issue surety bonds customarily required by commercial terms on construction projects 
us surety bonds represent the bond penalty amount of future payments we could be required to make if we fail to perform our obligations under such contracts 
the surety bonds do not have a stated expiration date  rather  each is released when the contract is accepted by the owner 
our maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced 
as of december   no liability has been recognized for letters of credit or surety bonds 
a summary of our off balance sheet commercial commitments for both continuing and discontinued operations as of december  is as follows expiration per period total less than more than commitment year years years letters of credit us performance canada performance other performance and retention total letters of credit us surety bonds primarily performance total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

table of contents the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
revenue a number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue 
we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and materials  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work  cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
revenue from unit price and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned 
revenue for fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
certain fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts include  or are amended to include  incentive bonus amounts  contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone 
revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed 
we do not recognize income on a fixed price contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete  depending upon the nature of the contract 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than the cost related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the balance sheet 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets we utilize the purchase accounting method for business combinations and record intangible assets separate from goodwill 
the fasb standard on goodwill stipulates a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
we do not have any other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we do have other intangible assets with finite lives 
these other intangible assets consist of customer relationships and backlog recorded in connection with the acquisition of inserv in november  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements recorded in connection with the acquisition of the engineering business of wink  in july and customer relationships  tradenames and technology recorded in connection with the acquisition of infrastrux in the value of existing customer relationships from the inserv  wink and infrastrux acquisitions was recorded at the estimated fair value determined by using a discounted cash flow method 
such acquired customer relationships have a finite useful life and are therefore being amortized over the estimated useful life of the relationships 
additionally  we were able to assign values to the trademarks and non compete agreements purchased in the wink acquisition 
the trademarks and non compete agreements were recorded at their fair value and are being amortized over the useful life of the contracts 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives whenever indicators of impairment exist  we evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment 
this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill we estimate the fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology and an analysis of comparable companies 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions 
this analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions including future growth rates  cash flow projections  wacc  operating cost escalation rates  rate of return  terminal value assumptions and long term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies in both the upstream and downstream markets 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
according to accounting standards for goodwill  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
during the third quarter of  in connection with the completion of our preliminary forecasts for  it became evident that a goodwill impairment associated with the downstream oil gas segment was probable 
due to time restrictions with the filing of our third quarter form q  we were unable to fully complete our two step impairment test 
according to the accounting standards for goodwill  if the second step step two of the goodwill impairment test is not complete before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and a goodwill impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated  the best estimate of that loss shall be recognized 
using a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair value of the segment versus its carrying value  an estimated range of likely impairment was determined and an impairment charge of  was recorded during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we performed our required annual test for goodwill impairment 
the results of the first step step one are as follows step one summary excess associated implied reporting unit fair value carrying value deficit goodwill impairment downstream oil gas     yes upstream oil gas     no utility t d n a n a n a  no under gaap  a company has up to one year subsequent to closing an acquisition to perform its annual testing for goodwill impairment  unless indicators of an impairment exist 
we closed on the acquisition of infrastrux  or utility t d  during the third quarter of no indicators of impairment  including the events that led to the reduction in the contingent earnout liability  for the utility t d segment were identified by management during the fourth quarter of accordingly  we have excluded them from our annual assessment of goodwill 
we will perform impairment testing for this segment during the second quarter of  or earlier should we identify any indicators of impairment 
represents goodwill prior to fourth quarter write downs 
if an impairment is indicated in step one of the assessment  step two is necessary and measures the amount of the impairment 
step two is performed by comparing the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill 
for this purpose  the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit that had goodwill associated with its operations was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination 
step two was performed for the downstream oil gas segment s as its carrying value did not exceed fair value 
this assessment resulted in a further write down of goodwill of  during the fourth quarter of as the step one fair value exceeded the carrying value for the upstream oil gas by  no impairment was taken 

table of contents additionally  we treated the write down of goodwill as a triggering event for all long lived assets with finite lives within the downstream oil gas segment 
as such  we reviewed these assets for impairment 
based on our review  at december   the effective date of our annual goodwill impairment testing  estimated future cash flows over the expected useful life for these assets exceeded their carrying value by approximately  accordingly  no impairment was taken 
at december   we have  in goodwill  of which  relates to our utility t d segment  relates to our downstream oil gas segment and  relates to our upstream oil gas segment 
leases we have entered into operating lease agreements  some of which contain provisions for future rent increases  rent free periods  or periods in which rent payments are reduced abated 
consistent with the fasb s standard on leases  the total amount of rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense on the straight line method over the term of the lease 
the difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent obligation  which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest rate contracts we have designated certain interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges 
no components of the hedging instruments are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
all changes in fair value of outstanding derivatives in cash flow hedges  except any ineffective portion  are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction 
classification of the gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations upon release from comprehensive income is the same as that of the underlying exposure 
when we discontinue hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur in the originally expected period  or within an additional two month period thereafter  changes to fair value accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings 
see note fair value measurements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments 
insurance we are insured for workers compensation  employer s liability and general liability claims  subject to a deductible of per occurrence 
we are also insured for auto liability claims  subject to a deductible of per occurrence 
additionally  our largest non union employee related health care benefit plan is subject to a deductible of per claimant per year 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  with assistance from third party actuaries 
for these claims  to the extent we have insurance coverage above the deductible amounts  we have recorded a receivable reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends 
income taxes the fasb standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of  of which  is related to state net operating losses with a 
table of contents valuation allowance of  against it  and deferred tax liabilities of  additionally  in we wrote off  of deferred tax assets related to equity based compensation 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in determination of our valuation allowance and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed profit rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects 
accounting pronouncements recently adopted effective january   we adopted the accounting standard that establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the guidance also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
this standard requires that income tax benefits related to business combinations that are not recorded at the date of acquisition are recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations when subsequently recognized 
previously  unrecognized income tax benefits related to business combinations were recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation when recognized 
beginning in  all acquisitions have been recorded based on this standard 
in january  the fasb issued guidance which expanded the required disclosures about fair value measurements 
in particular  this guidance requires i separate disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements along with the reasons for such transfers  ii information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  iii expanded fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and iv disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for ii above which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  appropriate disclosures have been made 
see note fair value measurements of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides amendments to previous guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
this standard clarifies the characteristics that identify a vie and changes how a reporting entity identifies a primary beneficiary that would consolidate the vie from a quantitative risk and rewards calculation to a qualitative approach based on which variable interest holder has controlling financial interest and the ability to direct the most significant activities that impact the vie s economic performance 
this statement requires the primary beneficiary assessment to be performed on a continuous basis 
it also requires additional disclosures about an entity s involvement with a vie  restrictions on the vie s assets and liabilities that are included in the reporting entity s consolidated balance sheet  significant risk exposures due to the entity s involvement with the vie  and how its involvement with a vie impacts the reporting entity s consolidated financial statements 
the standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of the standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on december   the fasb issued an update to its standard on goodwill impairment  which does not change the prescribed method of calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step one of the goodwill impairment test and requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering qualitative factors such as the impairment indicators listed in fasb s standard on goodwill  whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  the entity must perform step two of the goodwill impairment test 
the update is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  the adoption of this update is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recently proposed in august  the fasb issued a proposed accounting standard update on lease accounting that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities arising from lease contracts on the balance sheet 
the proposed accounting standard update states that lessees and lessors should apply a right of use model in accounting for all leases 
under the proposed model  lessees would recognize an asset for the right to use the leased asset  and a liability for the obligation to make rental payments over the lease term 
the lease term is defined as the longest possible term that is more likely than not to occur 
the accounting by a lessor would reflect its retained exposure to the risks or benefits of the underlying leased asset 
a lessor would recognize an asset representing its right to receive lease payments based on the expected term of the lease 
comments on this exposure draft were due december  and the final standard is expected to be issued sometime in while we believe that the proposed standard  as currently drafted  will likely have a material impact on our reported financial position and reported results of operations  it will not have a material impact on our liquidity  however  until the proposed standard is finalized  such evaluation cannot be completed 
effects of inflation and changing prices our operations are affected by increases in prices  whether caused by inflation  government mandates or other economic factors  in the countries in which we operate 
we attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor  equipment  fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non us primarily canada currency exchange rates 
we attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in us dollars  but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency 
to mitigate non us currency exchange risk  we seek to match anticipated non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible 
to the extent we are unable to match non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency  we may use forward contracts  options or other common hedging techniques in the same non us currencies 
we had no forward contracts or options at december  and the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december  due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits 
we have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity 
under the credit agreement  we are subject to hedging arrangements to fix or otherwise limit the interest cost of the term loan 
therefore  in september  we entered into two month forward interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of  in order to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense of half of the  term loan maturing on june  under the swap agreement  we receive interest at a floating rate of three month libor  conditional on three month libor exceeding percent to mirror variable rate interest provisions of the underlying hedged debt  and pays interest at a fixed rate of percent  effective march  through june  the swap agreement is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedging instrument and is deemed to be a highly effective hedge 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december  was and was based on using a model with level inputs including quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates 

table of contents we also entered into two interest rate cap agreements for notional amounts of  each in order to limit exposure to an increase of the interest rate above percent  effective september  through march  the cap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are deemed to be highly effective hedges 
the fair value of the interest rate caps was and was based on using a model with level inputs including quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates
