our products are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods and nutritional supplements markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers and direct consumers 
the company manufactures its products in hawaii  but markets them worldwide  generating  and of its revenues outside of the united states for each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  the company is influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which its customers operate  including adherence to its customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
the company currently has no material foreign exchange exposure as all sales are in us currency 
the company reported a net income of  or 
per diluted share for fiscal compared to net income of  or 
per diluted share for fiscal year cash and cash equivalents at march  were  up  from a year ago 
working capital increased to  at march  from working capital of  a year ago  primarily due to increased cash balances 

table of contents the following table details selected financial data highlighting three key areas year ended march  in thousands net sales spirulina products natural astaxanthin products other products gross profit as a percentage of sales operating expenses as a percentage of sales net sales for fiscal were  or higher than the  reported for the prior fiscal year 
sales increased in both spirulina and astaxanthin lines as production levels remained good and the company focused on human nutrition and expansion of its higher margin consumer products 
the company s emphasis is on growing the market for its high quality health and nutritional product  bioastin and spirulina pacifica  in both bulk form for use worldwide and in consumer packaged goods distributed primarily in the us mainstream media touted the health benefits of both astaxanthin and spirulina resulting in a increase in fourth quarter sales in both bulk and packaged products 
the company cannot predict the impact of this publicity on future period sales 
the company will continue to emphasize the higher nutritional content of its hawaiian spirulina and the benefits of our natural astaxanthin over synthetics  however  increased competition may result in the decline of margins in the future 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march   down from for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal year gross margin decrease of was primarily due to irregular production events resulting in non inventoriable production costs in the third and fourth quarters 
spirulina and astaxanthin production levels decreased by from the prior year 
the decrease in production levels was the result of three factors management s decision to reduce inventory  a foreign microbial plant inhibiting algae growth and a production equipment failure which introduced metal into some finished goods 
these factors combined to reduce output and increase the unit costs of our two algae 
the two preceding years reported lower unit costs as production levels were high  with no measurable weather events or production interruptions 
it is important to maintain reasonably strong production volumes in order to support the basic resource levels required to sustain a large scale  open culture  natural agricultural facility 
complex biological processes are involved and these processes are influenced by factors beyond the company s control the weather  for example we cannot assure that high production levels will continue 
the company continues to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
results of operations revenues net sales for fiscal totaled  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal and a increase from net sales of  reported in fiscal the following is a discussion of revenues by major product category 
spirulina the company has been producing spirulina pacifica  a strain of spirulina microalgae  since revenues generated from the company s spirulina products are a significant portion of total revenues  amounting to   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
spirulina revenues as a percentage of total revenues for each of the three years ended march   is  and  respectively 
approximately  or of net sales for the year ended march  were to a spirulina marketing and distribution company based in the netherlands 
sales to this customer during fiscal years and amounted to  or of net sales  and  or of net sales  respectively 

table of contents fiscal spirulina sales increased  or  the result of a increase in units sold and decrease in average selling price as compared to in fiscal  sales increased from resulting from more units sold and increase in average selling price 
competition for sales of spirulina remains intense due to the high number of suppliers 
we expect competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and will continue to focus on the higher quality of hawaiian spirulina in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
natural astaxanthin in fiscal  the company s sales of its natural astaxanthin products totalled  an increase of from  in fiscal  and an increase of from  in fiscal the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for was the result of a increase in units sold and a decrease in average selling price of 
the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for was the result of a increase in units sold and an increase in average selling price of 
two customers accounted for  or of net sales for the year ended march  a single customer accounted for  or of net sales for the year ended march  we believe that sales to these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net sales in future periods 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was at  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of nutrients and materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  depreciation and amortization of production equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements associated with the production of inventory units sold  and other production related period costs 
the cost of sales as a percent of sales increase of points between and is the result of reduced production and increased inventory reserve recognition 
the decrease of points between and  is the result of improved control of customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin and spirulina production 
customary variables include availability and costs of personnel  raw materials  energy  water and freight 
these variables fluctuate based on changes in the local  national and world economies 
complex variables include cultivation methods  feeding formulations and harvesting processes  all of which include efforts to anticipate the extent of weather and environmental events and make timely and sufficient adjustments 
although the variability of such costs cannot be fully anticipated  the company has focused increased effort in this area in order to produce both spirulina and astaxanthin at levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs into inventory 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale open culture agricultural facility 
fresh water is critical for the company s natural astaxanthin production and  while the company has not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  the company recycles fresh water where possible and has developed additional water recycling systems in its efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
both fresh and sea water require electricity for pumping  and electricity  the company s single largest expenditure  depends on the cost of fuel oil which is  in turn  tied to the global price of crude oil 
fuel costs remained at consistent levels throughout most of fiscal  trending upward the latter half of the fiscal year compared to the company did not incur the extreme highs experienced in fiscal continued volatility in fuel cost in the future is likely 
therefore  the company expects that electricity  water and shipping costs could be higher due to the impact of fuel cost increases for fiscal the company utilizes two third party contractors for the process of extraction for its natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  and several third party contractors are utilized for both encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets 
although these services are available from a limited number of sources  management believes the company has the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services and none are currently anticipated 
to offset increased production costs  the company seeks ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
the company recognizes abnormal production costs  including fixed cost variances from normal production capacity  as an expense in the period incurred 
abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
the company expensed abnormal production costs of  and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
non inventoriable fixed costs were  and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 

table of contents unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on cost of sales 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  and changes in processing or production methods 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased points to for the fiscal year ended march   down from for fiscal the decline is the result of lower production volume and increased inventory reserves resulting in higher costs 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased points to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal the improvement is the result of increased sales volume driven by product availability and quality  price increases instituted throughout and increases in units produced resulting in lower unit costs 
management expects the company s fiscal gross profit margin to improve from the results reported for fiscal there is currently no planned production slowdown to reduce inventory and the production interruptions experienced in fiscal year have been resolved 
however  as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  management cannot predict future production levels 
producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires the tenuous balancing of numerous factors including microalgal strain variations  temperature  acidity  nutrient and other environmental considerations  some of which are not in the company s control 
as a result  it can be difficult and time consuming to adjust  improve or correct production process when quality levels fall below specifications 
while the company generally possesses scientific knowledge and resources to correct its production processes  there are too many variables involved for the company to make reliable projections concerning such efforts 
however  management constantly strives to anticipate events requiring adjustments to nutrients  processes  customer demands  etc 
and strive to achieve increased production yields and improve quality 
in addition to the items discussed above  there are many factors which could materially diminish gross profit 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total operating expense decreased by  or less than from levels 
the decrease includes a decrease in general and administrative expenses of  an increase sales and marketing expense of  an increase in research and development expense of  and a decrease in loss on disposal of equipment and leasehold improvements of  the increase in from as a percentage of sales was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses of  an increase sales and marketing expense of  an increase in research and development expense of  and an increase in loss on disposal of equipment and leasehold improvements of  general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased from due to the costs associated with separation of the chief executive officer in march general and administrative expenses increased from to due to costs associated with separation of the chief executive officer in march and salary and benefits increases 
the company is committed to ongoing cost containment aimed at controlling its level of operating expenses  but may increase some discretionary spending in future periods as necessary to maintain product quality and the company s competitive position 
sales and marketing costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing in from fiscal and increasing in from fiscal the increase in over is due to the company expanding advertising and promotional programs in fiscal in order to increase consumer product sales levels in the mainland usa market 
the increase in over is due to the company resuming selected advertising and promotional programs in fiscal in order to maintain and expand sales levels 
management anticipates continuing advertising and promotional programs to increase consumer awareness in fiscal in order to maintain and expand sales levels as the company focuses on the higher margin consumer products 

research and development costs increased to  in  up from  in fiscal  and up by from  in fiscal the expense includes the balance of costs associated with a clinical trial initiated in fiscal year  to expand the applications of sprirulina products 
in fiscal  no product trials were underway  research resources focused on identifying potential areas to improve cultivation and production processes 
the company has benefited from these efforts in the subsequent fiscal years 
the company will continue to identify research activities that will expand the applications of its products  advance the efficiency of its production processes and or increase product quality 
loss on disposal of equipment and leasehold improvements was  in fiscal and  in fiscal year there was no loss on disposal of assets in 
table of contents management reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
management s analysis at march  determined that the company s equipment and leasehold improvements are not impaired in cyanotech s consolidated balance sheet at march  management expects fiscal operating expense spending will remain consistent with or increase from fiscal due to increased personnel costs  inflationary increases of expenses and the expansion of selected marketing and research activities as previously discussed 
the company will continue to leverage customer supported research where and as practicable 
increases in sales and marketing expenses may be necessary as the company seeks new and increased markets and market share 
also  the cost of regulatory compliance including international standards iso  us food and drug manufacturing practice gmp  securities and exchange commission requirements including sarbanes oxley  nasdaq capital market listing requirements and other regulatory compliance areas continue to increase 
finally  the company must remain competitive in the labor market  and this may lead to some increases in general and administrative costs 
other expense other expense  net was   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
it is comprised primarily of interest expense on term loans  amortization of debt issue costs and interest on other financing agreements  offset by deminimus interest earned and miscellaneous sales 
the declining balance is primarily due to the reduction of the principal balance on the company s term loans of   and  as of march   and  respectively 
income taxes for fiscal the company recorded an income tax benefit of  compared with an income tax expense of  for and  for the fiscal tax benefit is the result of a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance and recording of a net deferred tax asset at march  previous year income tax expense represents primarily alternative minimum taxes due to the utilization of tax loss carry forwards 
at march  the company had federal and hawaii state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition at march   the company s working capital was  an increase of  compared to  at march  cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled  an increase of  from  at march  the company had two term loan agreements term loans with a lender 
these provided up to million in combined credit facilities which are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
one term loan with a balance of  at march  was paid in full on may  the remaining term loan has a balance of approximately  as of march   payable in equal monthly principal and interest payment of approximately  and a maturity date of march  the interest rate under the term loans  in absence of a default under the agreement  is the prime rate in effect as of the close of business on the first day of each calendar quarter  plus 
the prime rate was at march  the company is prohibited by the term loan from declaring any cash dividends without the lender s prior written consent 
a  restricted cash deposit was held in an interest bearing restricted cash account per the terms of the term loan and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at march  the restricted cash was returned to the company in may of the company has two equipment loans with john deere at march  with a total outstanding combined balance of approximately  the equipment loans have maturity dates of december  as to  and march  as to  and are payable in equal monthly principal payments of approximately  the loans are at a rate of interest and are net of imputed interest of  the company has an equipment capital lease with thermo fisher financial services 
the outstanding balance under the capital lease as of march  is approximately  and has a maturity date of march 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents the company s debt and lease obligations at march  in thousands less than after year years years years total term loans operating leases total includes term loan  equipment loans and capital lease mentioned above 
on march   the company renewed the agreement with first hawaiian bank for a line of credit in the amount of  with a maturity date of april  the obligation is secured by the company s us accounts receivable and bears a variable interest rate based on prime plus 
there was no outstanding balance as of march  cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were  and  at march  and  respectively 
the company generated cash from operating activities was   and  for fiscal years  and respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations for was primarily due to the decrease in inventory of  compared to an increase in inventory in over of  the increase in cash provided by operations from was primarily due to an increase inventory of  compared with an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
depreciation expense for and was more than as a result of additions to depreciable assets in fiscal and it is uncertain whether operating activities will generate cash in future periods due to the volatility of the world economy and its impact on our foreign customers  and our ability to maintain production levels within a reasonable range 
cash of  was used in investing activities offset by  cash provided for the return of restricted cash  for net cash used in investing activities of  during fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during fiscal net cash used in investing activities in was  investments are primarily plant and equipment purchases aimed toward maintaining and enhancing our ability to respond to market demand 
management expects to continue to invest in equipment upgrades and leasehold improvements tied to market requirements and production efficiency 
investment was also made in expansion and enhancement of our resource management systems 
capital expenditures are expected to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal with projects to extend plant life  equipment additions and systems expansions 
during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  consisting of  cash provided from the exercise of stock options  offset by principal payments on term debt and revolving line of credit of  during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  consisting of  cash provided from drawing on the credit line with first hawaiian bank  offset by principal payments on term debt of  during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  representing principal payments on long term debt 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
with working capital of million and a current ratio of to as of march   management expects liquidity in fiscal to be generated primarily from operating cash flows 
unanticipated capital expenditures or business expansion could require the company to incur additional debt or equity funding sources 
the company has used estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching its conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results presented in this form k 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  governmental regulations and other factors beyond our control 

table of contents a significant portion of the company s expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
effect of recently issued accounting standards and estimates in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  an amendment to accounting standards codification asc no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures 
the standard requires disclosure for transfers in and out of level and level  as well as the disclosure of level activity on a gross  rather than net  basis 
the guidance also requires enhancements to certain existing disclosures 
the amendments will be effective as of the beginning of fiscal  except for the new requirements around level activity  which is deferred until the beginning of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management regularly re evaluates its judgments and estimates which are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies  policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are inventory valuations  valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements and long lived assets  and income taxes 
revenue we recognize revenue when product is shipped 
sales returns and allowances are recorded as a reduction to sales when we agree with a customer that a return or allowance is warranted 
promotions and other volume based incentives are charged to net sales in the period in which they can be reasonably known or estimated 
inventory the company records inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is defined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location 
cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors  such as first in  first out  average cost  and last in  first out 
our inventories are stated using the first in  first out method 
inventory values are subject to many critical estimates  including production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  changes in processing or production methods  and changes in the carrying value of our inventories resulting from the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products 
such estimates are revised quarterly 
changes in management s estimates could result in increases or decreases in the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
management reviews inventory levels  inventory turnover  product age and product marketability quarterly to evaluate recoverability and determine if a reserve for inventory is deemed necessary 
at march  an inventory reserve in the amount of  has been recognized 
in the prior fiscal year  march   an inventory reserve in the amount of  had been recognized 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
self constructed leasehold improvements include design  construction and supervision costs 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to equipment and leasehold improvements when construction is completed and the facilities are placed in service 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
judgment is required in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based on our operating results for the past three years we believe that the company will generate taxable income in future periods and therefore  conclude that it is more likely than not the company will realize a portion of its deferred tax assets before they expire 
accordingly  we reduced our valuation allowance by  during and recognized an income tax benefit of  in the current year 
our estimates of deferred tax assets to be realized may change in future periods  which could result in additional changes to our valuation allowance 
management has assessed the impact of uncertain tax positions to be immaterial 
should the company s operating performance not continue for a sustained period  we may need to re establish some or all of the valuation allowance
