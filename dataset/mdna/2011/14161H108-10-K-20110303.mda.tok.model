item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure about market risk  interest rate risk 
we maintain a significant amount of cash within our company owned devices  which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events  including natural disasters 
as of december   there was approximately billion in vault cash held in our domestic and international devices 
although legal and equitable title to such cash is held by the cash providers  any loss of such cash from our atms through theft or other means is typically our responsibility 
we typically require that our cash service providers maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of misconduct or negligence on the part of such providers 
however  we also maintain our own insurance policies to cover a significant portion of any losses that may occur that may ultimately not be covered by the insurance policies maintained by our service providers 
in the event we incur losses that are covered by our insurance carriers  we will be required to fund a portion of those losses through the payment of any related deductible amounts under those policies 
furthermore  any increase in the frequency and or amounts of such thefts and losses could negatively impact our operating results as a result of higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums 
additionally  any damage sustained to our merchant customers store locations in connection with any atm related thefts  if extensive and frequent enough in nature  could negatively impact our relationships with such merchants and impair our ability to deploy additional atms in those locations or new locations with those merchants in the future 
finally  impacted merchants may request  and have requested on a limited basis  that we remove atms from store locations that have suffered damage as a result of atm related thefts  thus negatively impacting our financial results 
the atm industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase  which may adversely affect our profit margins 
the atm business is and can be expected to remain highly competitive 
our principal competition comes from independent atm companies in the united states and the united kingdom  and national and regional financial institutions in the united kingdom and mexico 
additionally  we experience competition from national and regional financial institutions in the united states that are not currently bank branding customers or members of our allpoint surcharge free atm network 
our competitors could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining desirable locations for our devices  cause us to reduce the surcharge revenue generated by transactions at our devices  or cause us to pay higher merchant fees  thereby reducing our profits 
in addition to our current competitors  additional competitors may enter the market 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these current and future competitors 
increased competition could result in transaction fee reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the election of our merchant customers to not participate in our surcharge free network offerings could impact the networks effectiveness  which would negatively impact our financial results 
financial institutions that are members of allpoint pay a fee in exchange for allowing their cardholders to use selected company owned and or managed atms on a surcharge free basis 
the success of allpoint is dependent upon the participation by our merchant customers in such networks 
in the event a significant number of our merchants elect not to participate in such networks  the benefits and effectiveness of the networks would be diminished  thus potentially causing some of the participating financial institutions to not renew their agreements with us  and thereby negatively impacting our financial results 
we may be unable to integrate our future acquisitions in an efficient manner and inefficiencies would increase our cost of operations and reduce our profitability 
we have been an active business acquirer both in the united states and internationally  and may continue to be active in the future 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks 
the core risks are in the areas of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence and integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company s people  products  technology and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of the companies operations could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects 
in addition  acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows 
any shortfall in anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows could require us to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with any acquired company  which would adversely affect our reported earnings 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge to write down the value of the goodwill associated with our investment in our united kingdom operations 
since may  we have acquired atm networks and one surcharge free atm network 
prior to our e trade access acquisition in june  we had acquired only the assets of deployed atm networks  rather than businesses and their related infrastructure 
we currently anticipate that our future acquisitions will likely reflect a mix of asset acquisitions and acquisitions of businesses  with each acquisition having its own set of unique characteristics 
to the extent that we elect to acquire an existing company or the operations  technology  and personnel of another atm provider  we may assume some or all of the liabilities associated with the acquired company and face new and added challenges integrating such acquisition into our operations 
any inability on our part to effectively manage our past or future growth could limit our ability to successfully grow the revenue and profitability of our business 
our international operations involve special risks and may not be successful  which would result in a reduction of our gross profits 
as of december   of our devices were located in the united kingdom and mexico 
those devices contributed of our gross profits exclusive of depreciation  accretion  and amortization for the year ended december  we expect to continue to expand in the united kingdom and mexico and potentially into other countries as opportunities arise 
however  our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the united states dollar  which represents our consolidated reporting currency  difficulties in complying with the different laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate  including unique labor and reporting laws  unexpected changes in laws  regulations  and policies of foreign governments or other regulatory bodies  including changes that could potentially disallow surcharging or that could result in a reduction in the amount of interchange or other transaction fees received per transaction  unanticipated political and social instability that may be experienced  rising crime rates in certain of the areas we operate in  including increased incidents of crimes against store personnel where our atms are located  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including hiring and retaining skilled workers in those countries in which we operate  decreased atm usage related to decreased travel and tourism in the markets that we operate in  such as our atms in mexico that are located in tourist destinations  and potential adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
any of these factors could reduce the profitability and revenues derived from our international operations and international expansion 
for example  during the latter half of and during  we incurred reduced reported revenues as a consequence of the united states dollar strengthening relative to the british pound and mexican peso 
additionally  the recent regulatory changes in mexico have had an adverse impact on our transaction volumes in that market 
furthermore  the recent political and social instability in mexico resulting from an increase in drug related violence could negatively impact the level of transactions incurred on our existing devices in that market  as well as our ability to successfully grow our business there 
see further discussion on this topic in the above risk factor entitled the passing of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our atms would severely impact our revenues 
our possible expansion efforts into new international markets involve unique risks and may not be successful 
we may continue to expand our operations internationally with a likely focus on high growth emerging markets  such as those in central and eastern europe  central and south america  and the asia pacific region 
because the off premise atm industry is relatively undeveloped in these emerging markets  we may not be successful in these expansion efforts 
in particular  many of these markets do not currently employ or support an off premise atm surcharging model  meaning that we would have to rely on interchange fees as our primary source of revenues 
while we have had some success in deploying non surcharging atms in selected markets  such a model requires significant transaction volumes to make it economically feasible to purchase and deploy atms 
furthermore  most of the atms in these markets are owned and operated by financial institutions  thus increasing the risk that cardholders would be unwilling to utilize an off premise atm with an unfamiliar brand 
finally  the regulatory environments in many of these markets are evolving and unpredictable  thus increasing the risk that a particular deployment model chosen at inception may not be economically viable in the future 
if we experience impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets  we will be required to record a charge to earnings  which may be significant 
we have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform periodic assessments for any possible impairment for accounting purposes 
as of december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  or of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability and the amortization period of our intangible assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
some of the factors that we consider to be important in assessing whether or not impairment exists include the performance of the related assets relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
these factors  assumptions  and any changes in them could result in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the event we determine our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements  which would negatively impact our results of operations and that impact could be material 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  during the years ended december  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net impairment charges associated with intangibles related to our acquired merchant contracts relationships 
other impairment charges in the future may also adversely affect our results of operations 
additionally  the new and potential regulatory issues facing our mexico operations could result in the potential impairment of assets associated with those operations 
although the annual impairment test performed at december  did not indicate an impairment of goodwill related to our mexico operations  the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of that reporting unit significantly decreased compared to a year ago 
we have plans to mitigate the impact of the decreased transaction levels in mexico  and have several initiatives that are currently being developed  which  if successful  would likely generate better operating results than the estimated results in the analysis 
for further discussion on this topic  see the above risk factor entitled the passing of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our atms would severely impact our revenues 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business  remain in compliance with debt covenants  and make payments on our indebtedness 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  which represents of our total capitalization of million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments  including financial and other restrictive covenants  could result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow in the future to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  and adverse changes in government regulation  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs  or other purposes 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or sell securities  none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 
the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 
our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes include a number of covenants that  among other items  restrict or limit our ability to sell or transfer property or assets  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock  merge into or consolidate with any third party  create  incur  assume or guarantee additional indebtedness  create certain liens  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  issue or sell preferred stock of restricted subsidiaries  and enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  we are required by our credit agreement to adhere to certain covenants and maintain specified financial ratios 
while we currently have the ability to borrow the full amount available under our credit agreement  as a result of these ratios  we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business in the future and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance our future operations or capital needs 
accordingly  these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
a failure to comply with the covenants or financial ratios could result in an event of default 
in the event of a default under our credit agreement  the lenders could exercise a number of remedies  some of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes 
an acceleration of indebtedness under our credit agreement would also likely result in an event of default under the terms of any other financing arrangement we have outstanding at the time 
if any or all of our debt were to be accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our indebtedness in full 
if we are unable to repay any amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility when due  the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral securing our indebtedness 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing facilities 
we incurred substantial losses in the past and may incur losses again in the future 
although we generated a net profit in the last two years of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  we incurred net losses in the preceding years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to achieve profitability in the future 
even if we continue to be profitable  given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the passing of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our atms would severely impact our revenues 
despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at atms in the united states since their introduction in  consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees 
even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of santa monica  california  federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds 
although section of the dodd frank act passed in july contains a provision that will limit the application of federal preemption with respect to state laws that do not discriminate against national banks  federal preemption will not be affected by local municipal laws  where such proposed bans or limits often arise 
more recently  some federal officials have expressed concern that surcharge fees charged by banks and non bank atm operators are unfair to consumers 
to that end  an amendment proposing limits on the fees that atm operators  including financial institutions  can charge consumers was recently introduced in the united states senate  but was not ultimately included in the final version of the dodd frank act that was signed into law 
if similar proposed legislation were to be enacted in the future  and the amount we were able to charge for consumers to use our atms was reduced  our revenues and related profitability would be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if such limits were set at levels that are below our current or future costs to operate our atms  it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate under our current business model 
in the united kingdom  the treasury select committee of the house of commons published a report regarding surcharges in the atm industry in march following this report  this committee was formed to investigate public concerns regarding the atm industry  including adequacy of disclosure to atm customers regarding surcharges  whether atm providers should be required to provide free services in low income areas and whether to limit the level of surcharges 
while the committee made numerous recommendations to parliament regarding the atm industry  including that atms should be subject to the banking code a voluntary code of practice adopted by all financial institutions in the united kingdom  the united kingdom government did not accept the committee s recommendations 
despite the rejection of the committee s recommendations  the united kingdom government sponsored an atm task force to look at social exclusion in relation to atm services 
as a result of the task force s findings  approximately additional free to use atms to be provided by multiple atm providers were required to be installed in low income areas throughout the united kingdom 
while this was less than a increase in free to use atms throughout the united kingdom  there is no certainty that other similar proposals will not be made and accepted in the future 
if the legislature or another body with regulatory authority in the united kingdom were to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in the united kingdom would be negatively impacted 
in mexico  surcharging for off premise atms was legalized in late  but was not formally implemented until july in early october  the central bank of mexico adopted new rules regarding how atm operators disclose fees to consumers 
the objective of these rules was to provide more transparency to the consumer regarding the cost of a specific atm transaction  rather than to limit the amount of fees charged to the consumer 
such rules  which became effective in may  required atm operators to elect between receiving interchange fees from card issuing banks or surcharge fees from consumers 
cardtronics mexico elected to assess a surcharge fee on the consumer rather than select the interchange fee only option  and subsequently raised the level of its surcharge fees in order to recoup the interchange fees it is no longer receiving 
since the new fee structure became effective  the number of cash withdrawal transactions conducted on cardtronics mexico s atms has substantially declined on a same store basis as compared to the same period in  and  to date  there has been no indication that suggests transaction levels will recover to levels experienced prior to the new rules being in effect 
at the current transaction levels  the additional surcharge fee amounts at a number of cardtronics mexico s atms are not sufficient to offset the lost interchange revenues  which has resulted in lower revenues and profitability per atm in that market 
additionally  in late october  an additional rule went into effect in mexico that prohibits a bank from assessing any atm usage fee at its atms on any of its accountholders 
while this rule does not affect cardtronics mexico s ability to assess a surcharge fee to any cardholder who uses our atms other than the accountholders of bansi  our sponsoring financial institution in mexico and equity partner in cardtronics mexico  whom we have never assessed any fees and which represent less than of the total transactions conducted on cardtronics mexico s atms  this new rule may further motivate cardholders to use their own bank s atms in order to avoid any fees whatsoever and thus further reduce transactions at cardtronics mexico s atms 
as a result of the above developments  we have reduced our atm deployments in mexico in order to better measure the impact of the above rules on our atm transaction levels and related profits 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to implement certain measures to mitigate the effects of these new rules in mexico  our overall profitability in that market will decline and we may be required to record an impairment charge in future periods to write down the carrying value of certain existing tangible and intangible assets associated with that operation 
furthermore  one of our primary merchant contracts in mexico requires us to install a certain number of atms within a specified period of time in order to maintain exclusive rights to deploy atms at their retail locations 
as a result of the negative effects of the recent regulatory changes to the cardtronics mexico business and our decision to reduce our atm deployments  we could lose our exclusivity rights with this merchant 
potential new currency designs may require modifications to our atms that could severely impact our cash flows 
on november   a us district court judge ruled that the united states currencies as currently designed violate the rehabilitation act  a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability  as the paper currencies issued by the united states are identical in size and color  regardless of denomination 
as a consequence of this ruling  the united states treasury conducted a study to determine the options to make united states paper currency accessible to the blind or visually impaired 
it is our understanding that the bep received that study on or about july   and together with the united states treasury and the federal reserve  are reviewing the study 
upon the completion of that review  these institutions will publish their recommendations and thereafter seek public comments in writing and at public forums on those recommendations 
following the public comment period  a final recommendation will be made to the secretary of the treasury  who has authority to change the design and features of the currency notes utilized in the united states 
while it is still uncertain at this time what impact  if any  this process will have on the atm industry including us  it is possible that any changes made to the design of the paper currency notes utilized in the united states could require us to incur additional costs  which could be substantial  to modify our atms in order to store and dispense such notes 
noncompliance with established eft network rules and regulations could expose us to fines and penalties and could negatively impact our results of operations 
additionally  new eft network rules and regulations could require us to expend significant amounts of capital to remain in compliance with such rules and regulations 
our transactions are routed over various eft networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances 
these networks include star  pulse  nyce  cirrus  and plus in the united states  link in the united kingdom  and prosa red in mexico 
eft networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions  as well as the amounts paid to us 
additionally  eft networks  including mastercard and visa  establish rules and regulations that atm providers  including ourselves  must comply with in order for member cardholders to use those atms 
failure to comply with such rules and regulations could expose us to penalties and or fines  which could negatively impact our financial results 
for example  in the united kingdom  mastercard and visa require compliance with the emv security standard 
this standard provides for the security and processing of information contained on microchips imbedded in certain debit and credit cards  known as smart cards 
while we completed our compliance efforts in this regard in  we incurred million in charges earlier that year due to transactions conducted on our machines with counterfeit cards prior to the completion of our emv certification efforts 
in january  the central bank of mexico decided that the atms in the country should be compliant with the emv standard as well 
the date of implementation of the emv standard varies by the risk grade of the atms  with high risk atms implemented by september   medium risk atms by september   and low risk atms by september  as of december   cardtronics mexico had approximately high risk atms  medium risk atms  and  low risk atms 
we expect the implementation of this standard will require approximately million  million  and million in capital expenditures during  and  respectively 
in addition to the above  new rules or regulations enacted by the eft networks could require us to expend significant sums of capital to ensure that our atms and financial services kiosks remain in compliance with such rules and regulations 
for example  we expended significant sums of capital in recent years to meet the triple des security standard mandated by mastercard and visa 
similar rules and regulations that may be enacted in the future could result in us having to make additional capital outlays in order to remain in compliance  some of which could be significant 
the majority of the electronic debit networks over which our transactions are conducted require sponsorship by a bank 
in each of the geographic segments in which we operate  bank sponsorship is required in order to process transactions over certain networks 
in the united states  our largest geographic segment by revenues  bank sponsorship is required on the significant majority of our transactions and we currently rely on one primary sponsor bank for access to the applicable networks 
in our united kingdom segment  only international transactions require bank sponsorship 
in mexico  all atm transactions require bank sponsorship  which is currently provided by our noncontrolling interest partner 
if our current sponsor banks decide to no longer provide this service  or are no longer financially capable of providing this service as may be determined by certain networks  it may be difficult to find an adequate replacement at a cost similar to what we incur today  or potentially  we could incur a temporary service disruption for certain transactions in the event we lose or do not retain bank sponsorship 
developments in electronic financial transactions could materially reduce our transaction levels and revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the need for services offered at our devices in the future 
these developments could encompass technological changes and advancement in the areas of payments as well as physical self service financial devices  governmental actions  customer preferences  as well as other factors 
if transaction levels over our existing atm locations were to decrease as a result of one or several of these developments  our business could be adversely affected 
the passing of anti money laundering legislation could cause us to lose certain merchant accounts and reduce our revenues 
recent concerns by the us federal government regarding the use of atms to launder money could lead to the imposition of additional regulations on our sponsoring financial institutions and our merchant customers regarding the source of cash loaded into their atms 
in particular  such regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs by individual merchants who load their own cash  thereby making their atms less profitable 
accordingly  some individual merchants may decide to discontinue their atm operations  thus reducing the number of merchant owned accounts that we currently manage 
if such a reduction were to occur  we would see a corresponding decrease in our revenues 
our operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future  which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the atm and financial services industries  changes in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate  competition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses  capital expenditures  and expenses related to the expansion of sales  marketing  and operations  including as a result of acquisitions  if any  the timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill  intangible assets or long lived assets  changes in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate  changes in regulatory requirements associated with the atm and financial services industries  changes in the mix of our current services  changes in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers  and changes in the financial condition and operational execution of our key vendors and service providers 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent years  this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to personnel expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  and interest expense 
therefore  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
as such  comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing automated consumer financial services industry and the geographical segments in which we operate 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of several of our senior executives would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage and retain other qualified management  as well as technical and operational personnel as we grow 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future  which could adversely impact our business
