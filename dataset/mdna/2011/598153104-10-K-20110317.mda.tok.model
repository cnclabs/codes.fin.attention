the company is currently transitioning itself from an exploration company to a gold production company with plans to advance the pan gold deposit located in white pine county  nevada through to production by as early as spring valley project barrick has the exclusive right to earn a interest in the spring valley project by spending us  on the property over five years 
barrick may increase its interest by total by spending an additional us  in the year immediately after vesting at 
at the company election  barrick may also earn an additional total by carrying the company to a production decision and arranging financing for the company share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by barrick once production has been established

in the three months ended december    was spent at the midway project    at the spring valley project    at the pan project and   combined at the company other exploration projects and property investigations

summary of quarterly results unaudited quarter ended in quarter ended in dec sept june march dec sept june march in thousands  except per share and total cash cost per ounce data revenue from the sale of minerals nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil net loss net loss per share  basic and diluted notes and factors affecting comparability of quarters the company is a mineral exploration company at the exploration stage and has no operating revenues 
stock based compensation costs are a non cash expense and represent an estimate of the fair value of stock options granted 
these expenses are often the largest item included in the statement of operations and they represent a significant source of variation in loss from quarter to quarter 
stock based compensation is allocated between salaries and benefits and mineral exploration expenditures 
costs for the june quarter tend to be higher due to printing and mailing of shareholder material for the company annual general meeting and costs of conducting this meeting 
costs for the december quarter also tend to be higher due to accruals for the annual audit 
administratively  management tends to critically review all exploration projects in detail at this time of year and makes decisions about which projects it wishes to continue and which projects it will abandon 
financial condition and liquidity the company began the year with cash on hand of  during the company expended  on operations  invested a total of  in mineral property and equipment net of proceeds on sale of surplus equipment  the recovery of reclamation deposits and proceeds on sale of investments and raised  from one private placement  two public offerings and the exercise of share purchase warrants for cash to end at december  with cash on hand of  the company has not generated revenues from operations 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the foreseeable future 
management believes that the company cash on hand at december  combined with amounts received from the issuance of shares subsequent to december  note to the audited consolidated financial statements is sufficient to finance exploration activities and operations through the next twelve months 
the company ability to continue on a going concern basis beyond the next twelve months depends on its ability to successfully raise additional financing for the substantial capital expenditures required to achieve planned principal operations 
while the company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing  there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
these financial statements do not reflect adjustments that would be necessary if the going concern assumption were not appropriate 
in  the company issued a total of  common shares pursuant to one private placement  two public offerings and the exercise of share purchase warrants for cash proceeds  net of issue costs  of  subsequent to december  the company issued a total of  common shares pursuant to the exercise of share purchase warrants for cash proceeds of approximately  as of march   there are  stock options at prices ranging from to 
while it is probable that some of these options will be exercised  it is not possible to predict the timing or the amount of funds which might be received 
as at march   there are  share purchase warrants that are in the money which if exercised will raise a total of  midway plans to raise capital in to fund its continued exploration and development 
contractual obligations there are no contractual obligations other than those described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as of december   we have accrued  us  related to reclamation and other closure requirements at our properties  compared to  at december  these liabilities are covered by a combination of surety bonds and restricted cash totaling  us  at december  
we have accrued as a current liability what management believes is the present value of our best estimate of the liabilities as of december   however  it is possible that our obligations may change in the near or long term depending on a number of factors 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements include our estimate of recoverable value on our property  plant and equipment  site reclamation and rehabilitation as well as the value assigned to stock based compensation expense and the estimates of future income tax liabilities 
these estimates involve considerable judgment and are  or could be  affected by significant factors that are out of our control 
the factors affecting stock based compensation include estimates of when stock options might be exercised and the stock price volatility 
the timing for exercise of options is out of our control and will depend  among other things  upon a variety of factors including the market value of midway common shares and financial objectives of the holders of the options 
we used historical data to determine volatility in accordance with black scholes modeling  however the future volatility is inherently uncertain and the model has its limitations 
while these estimates can have a material impact on the stock based compensation expense and hence results of operations  there is no impact on our financial condition 
midway recoverability evaluation of its mineral properties and equipment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineral resources associated with the assets and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
midway is in an industry that is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties  including exploration risk  development risk  commodity price risk  operating risk  ownership and political risk  funding and currency risk  as well as environmental risk 
bearing these risks in mind  midway has assumed recent world commodity prices will be achievable 
we have considered the mineral resource reports by independent engineers on the midway  spring valley  pan  gold rock and golden eagle projects in considering the recoverability of the carrying costs of the mineral properties 
all of these assumptions are potentially subject to change  out of our control  however such changes are not determinable 
acco rdingly  there is always the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties and equipment 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result midway has recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs it expects to incur 
the company estimated applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
recent united states accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting standards to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity which also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the new standard became effective for the company fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company financial statements 
in january  fasb issued an accounting standards update for fair value measurements and disclosure 
this update requires additional disclosures related to transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements and enhanced detail in the level reconciliation 
the guidance was amended to clarify the level of disaggregation required for assets and liabilities and the disclosures required for inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities that fall in either level or level the updated guidance became effective for the company fiscal year beginning january  with the exception of the level of disaggregation which becomes effective for the company fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material effect on the company financial statements 
in january  fasb issued an accounting standards update for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or de recognition of a group of assets 
this update requires additional disclosure related to the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of any retained investment in the former subsidiary or group of assets  the nature of the continuing involvement with the subsidiary or entity acquiring the group of assets and whether the transaction was with a related party or whether the former subsidiary or entity acquiring the group of assets will become a related party 
this amendment clarifies but does not change the scope of current us gaap 
the updated guidance became effective for the company fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of the updated guidance did not have a material effect on the company financial statements
