overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  formed to continue the business commenced in by our predecessor companies to own  operate  manage  acquire  develop and redevelop professionally managed self storage properties 
since our ipo  our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of self storage properties 
at december   we owned  had ownership interests in  or managed operating properties in states and washington  dc of these operating properties  were wholly owned  we held joint venture interests in properties  and our taxable reit subsidiary  extra space management  inc  operated an additional properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee 
these operating properties contain approximately million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately  units and currently serve a customer base of over  tenants 
our properties are generally situated in convenient  highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta  baltimore washington  dc  boston  chicago  dallas  houston  las vegas  los angeles  miami  new york city  orlando  philadelphia  phoenix  st 
petersburg tampa and san francisco oakland 
these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels 
the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale 
we consider a property to be in the lease up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy  but before it has achieved stabilization 
a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january  or has been open for three years 
to maximize the performance of our properties  we employ a state of the art  web based tracking and yield management technology called store 
developed by our management team  store enables us to analyze  set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions 
in addition  we also have an industry leading revenue management system called revman 
we believe that the combination of store yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using revman allows us to more proactively manage revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self storage properties  from management fees on the properties we manage for joint venture partners  franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program 
our management fee is equal to approximately of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties 
we operate in competitive markets  often where consumers have multiple self storage properties from which to choose 
competition has impacted  and will continue to impact our property results 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels  with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity 
our operating results depend materially on our 
table of contents ability to lease available self storage units  to actively manage unit rental rates  and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments 
we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local  regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store  and through the use of revman 
we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value 
our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following maximize the performance of properties through strategic  efficient and proactive management 
we pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations 
our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system ability to provide real time  interactive rental rate and discount management 
our size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national  regional and local marketing programs  which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost 
expand our management business 
our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint 
this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale 
in addition  we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline 
we pursue strategic relationships with owners that strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which typically give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale 
acquire self storage properties from strategic partners and third parties 
our acquisitions team continues to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi property portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value 
we have established a reputation as a reliable  ethical buyer  which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions 
in addition  our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals 
during  we acquired wholly owned properties and completed the development of four wholly owned properties  all in our core markets 
we have six development properties remaining 
all six are wholly owned and are scheduled for completion by the end of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or ii the entity equity holders as a group either a lack the power  through voting or similar rights  to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur  or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie  the enterprise 
table of contents that is deemed to have a variable interest  or combination of variable interests  that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit  or enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures  a vie may be created under condition i  ii b or c of the previous paragraph 
for each vie created  we have performed a qualitative analysis  including considering which party  if any  has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements 
additionally  our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition ii a above 
since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts  these vies are not consolidated 
real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development  construction  renovation  and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized 
interest  property taxes  and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements  which are generally between five and years 
in connection with our acquisition of properties  the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values  which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs 
the value of the tangible assets  consisting of land and buildings  are determined as if vacant 
intangible assets  which represent the value of existing tenant relationships  are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases 
we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities 
debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates 
acquisition related transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
intangible lease rights include purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases  these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases 
the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles  which will be amortized over the lease terms 
evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist 
we focus on properties where occupancy and or rental income have decreased by a significant amount 
for these properties  we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy and or revenue in the short term 
in addition  we carefully review properties in the lease up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections 
when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred  we compare the carrying value of the related long lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds 
table of contents the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets 
when real estate assets are identified as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets  net of selling costs 
if the estimated fair values  net of selling costs  of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets  then a valuation allowance is established 
the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  receivables  other financial instruments included in other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  variable rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts  lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and approximate fair value 
the fair values of our notes receivable  our fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows december  december  fair value carrying value fair value carrying value note receivable from preferred operating partnership unit holder fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts exchangeable senior notes investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control  and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary  are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under the equity method  our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions 
equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures 
for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows  we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures 
under this approach  distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg  a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity 
our management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
an investment is impaired if management estimate of the fair value of the investment  using significant unobservable inputs  is less than its carrying value 
to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 

table of contents for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income  outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
conversion of operating partnership units conversions of operating partnership units to common stock  when converted under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement  are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity 
the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the company 
revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants 
leases are generally on month to month terms 
prepaid rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period 
late charges  administrative fees  merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned 
management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements 
tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage 
equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities 
interest income is recognized as earned 
property expenses  including utilities  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred 
we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts  estimates and historical trends 
if these estimates are incorrect  the timing of expense recognition could be affected 
real estate sales in general  sales of real estate and related profits losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition  other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  among other things  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets 
as a reit  we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders 
we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
we are subject to certain state and local taxes 
provision for such taxes has been included in property operating and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries  extra space management  inc  as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred 
stock based compensation the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values 
awards are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new fair value measurements and disclosures standards to increase the transparency of these measures 
the standards revise two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarify two others 
they require separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers 
they will also require the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within level on a gross basis rather than a net basis 
the amendments also clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
these new disclosure requirements were effective for the period ended march   except for the requirement concerning gross presentation of level activity  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the new standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued changes to accounting standards codification asc  consolidation  which amended guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie  and requires the performance of a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie 
under this guidance  an entity would be required to consolidate a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie 
this guidance became effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november   with early adoption prohibited 
we adopted this guidance effective january  and reviewed the terms of all joint ventures in relation to the new guidance 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that five joint ventures that were consolidated under the previous accounting guidance should be deconsolidated as of january  the assets and liabilities associated with these joint ventures were removed from our financial statements and our investments in these joint ventures were recorded under the equity method of accounting during the year ended december  results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  overview results for the year ended december  included the operations of properties of which were consolidated and of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method compared to the results for the year ended december   which included operations of properties of which were consolidated and of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method

we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings 
net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis 
we believe that to further understand our performance  ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance  as an alternative to net cash flow from 
table of contents operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions

it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital

the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at december  was 
certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt 
we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements  including operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures  dividends to stockholders  distributions to holders of op units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit lines 
in addition  we are actively pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered properties 
our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders  facility development  property acquisitions  principal payments under our borrowings and non recurring capital expenditures 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our outstanding debt  shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or redemptions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
in addition  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships  which may require us to raise additional funds 
we do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness  joint ventures with third parties  and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt 
additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
any additional issuance of equity or equity linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock 
we may also use op units as currency to fund acquisitions from self storage owners who desire tax deferral in their exiting transactions 
the us credit markets have experienced dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen 
these circumstances have impacted liquidity in the 
table of contents debt markets  making financing terms for borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects 
in addition  the financial condition of the lenders of our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse affect on other financial markets in the united states  which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities 
these disruptions in the financial market may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally  which could cause our stock price to decline 
off balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
our exchangeable senior notes provide for excess exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount

financing strategy we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors 
although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur  we will consider a number of factors in evaluating 
table of contents our level of indebtedness from time to time  as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate 
in making financing decisions  we will consider factors including but not limited to the interest rate of the proposed financing  the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties  prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing  the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing  long term objectives with respect to the financing  target investment returns  the ability of particular properties  and our company as a whole  to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments  overall level of consolidated indebtedness  timing of debt and lease maturities  provisions that require recourse and cross collateralization  corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage  debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets  and the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt 
our indebtedness may be recourse  non recourse or cross collateralized 
if the indebtedness is non recourse  the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates 
in addition  we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties  or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 
we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness  to refinance investments  including the redevelopment of existing properties  for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable 
during and  we repurchased  in aggregate principal amount of our exchangeable senior notes on the open market for  in cash 
we may from time to time seek to retire  repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or redemptions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
seasonality the self storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september 
historically  our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july  while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march 
results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our future income  cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we had approximately billion in total debt  of which approximately million was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps 
if libor were to increase or decrease by basis points  the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
