item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other documents we file with the sec from time to time  the following factors may affect our results of operations and cash flows and the market prices of our publicly traded securities 
these factors may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
the factors listed below are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks  and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the sec 
weather conditions  including mild and severe weather  may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity 
our customers use electricity for heating in winter months and cooling in summer months 
because of air conditioning demand  typically we produce our highest revenues in the third quarter 
milder temperatures reduce demand for electricity and have a corresponding affect on our revenues 
unusually mild weather in the future could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
in addition  severe weather conditions can produce storms that can inflict extensive damage to our equipment and facilities that can require us to incur additional operating and maintenance expense and additional capital expenditures 
our prices may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these higher costs 
additionally  because many of our power plants use water for cooling  severe drought conditions could result in limited power production 
our prices are subject to regulatory review and may not prove adequate 
we must obtain from state and federal regulators the authority to establish terms and prices for our services 
the kcc and  for most of our wholesale customers  ferc  use a cost of service approach that takes into account operating expenses  fixed obligations and recovery of and return on capital investments 
using this approach  the kcc and ferc set prices at levels calculated to recover these costs and a permitted return on investment 
except for wholesale transactions for which the price is not so regulated  and except to the extent the kcc and ferc permit us to modify our prices by using approved formulae  our prices generally remain fixed until changed following a rate review 
further  the adjustments and formulae may be modified  limited or eliminated by regulatory or legislative actions 
we may apply to change our prices or intervening parties may request that our prices be reviewed for possible adjustment 
rate proceedings through which our prices and terms of service are determined typically involve numerous parties including electricity consumers  consumer advocates and governmental entities  some of whom frequently take positions adverse to us 
the decision making process used in these proceedings may or may not be subject to statutory timelines  and in any event regulators decisions may be appealed to the courts by us or other parties to the proceedings 
these factors may lead to uncertainty and delays in implementing changes to our prices or terms of service 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will find all of our costs to have been prudently incurred 
a finding that costs have been imprudently incurred can lead to disallowance of recovery for those costs 
the prices approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for us to recover our costs and to provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments 
we cannot predict the outcome of any rate review or the actions of our regulators 
the outcome of rate proceedings  or delays in implementation of new prices regarding costs that we have already incurred  could have a significant affect on our ability to recover costs and could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial results 

table of contents significant decisions about capital investments are based on forecasts of long term demand for energy incorporating assumptions about multiple  uncertain factors 
our actual experience may differ significantly from our assumptions  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
we attempt to forecast demand to determine the timing and adequacy of our energy and energy delivery resources 
long term forecasts involve risks because they rely on assumptions we make concerning uncertain factors including weather  technological change  economic conditions  regulatory requirements  social pressures and the responsiveness of customers electricity demand to conservation measures and prices 
actual future demand depends on these and other factors and may vary materially from our forecasts 
if our actual experience varies significantly from our forecasts  our consolidated financial results may be adversely affected 
our ability to fund our capital expenditures and meet our working capital and liquidity needs may be limited by conditions in the bank and capital markets or by our credit ratings or the market price of westar energy s common stock 
to fund our capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity  we rely on access to capital markets and to short term credit 
disruption in capital markets  deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which we rely  any credit rating downgrade or any decrease in the market price of westar energy s common stock may make capital more difficult and costly for us to obtain  may restrict liquidity available to us  may require us to defer or limit capital investments or impact operations  or may reduce the value of our financial assets 
these and other related affects may have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results  including our ability to pay dividends and to make investments or undertake programs necessary to meet regulatory mandates and customer demand 
our planned capital investment for the next few years is large in relation to our size  subjecting us to significant risks 
our anticipated capital expenditures for through are approximately billion 
in addition to risks discussed above associated with recovering capital investments through our prices  and risks associated with our reliance on the capital markets and short term credit to fund those investments  our capital expenditure program poses risks  including  but not necessarily limited to shortages  disruption in the delivery and inconsistent quality of equipment  materials and labor  contractor or supplier non performance  delays in or failure to receive necessary permits  approvals and other regulatory authorizations  impacts of new and existing laws and regulations  including environmental laws  regulations and permit requirements  adverse weather  unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope  environmental and geological conditions  and unanticipated cost increases with respect to labor or materials  including basic commodities needed for our infrastructure such as steel  copper and aluminum 
these and other factors  or any combination of them  could cause us to defer or limit our capital expenditure program and could adversely impact our consolidated financial results 

table of contents capital market conditions can cause fluctuations in the values of assets set aside for employee benefit obligations and the wolf creek ndt and may increase our funding requirements related to these obligations 
we have significant future financial obligations with respect to employee benefit obligations and the wolf creek ndt 
the value of the assets needed to meet those obligations are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns  which may fall below our expectations  upon which we plan to meet our obligations 
additionally  changes in interest rates affect the value of future liabilities 
while the kcc has recently allowed us to implement a regulatory accounting mechanism to track certain of our employee benefit plan expenses  this mechanism does not allow us to make automatic price adjustments 
only in future rate proceedings may we be allowed to adjust our prices to reflect changes in our funding requirements for these benefit plans 
further  the tracking mechanism for these benefit plan expenses is part of our overall rate structure  and as such it is subject to kcc review and may be modified  limited or eliminated in the future 
if these assets are not managed successfully  our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected 
adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our operations and our consolidated financial results 
our operations are affected by economic conditions 
adverse general economic conditions including a prolonged recession or capital market disruptions may reduce demand for our service  increase delinquencies or non payment by customers  adversely impact the financial condition of suppliers  which may in turn limit our access to inventory or capital equipment or increase our costs  increase deductibles and premiums and result in more restrictive policy terms under insurance policies regarding risks we typically insure against  or make insurance claims more difficult to collect  result in lower worldwide demand for coal  oil and natural gas  which may decrease fossil fuel prices and put downward pressure on electricity prices  and reduce the credit available to our energy trading counterparties and correspondingly reduce our energy trading activity or increase our exposure to counterparty default 
any of these events  and others we may not be able to identify  could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
deliveries of fuel for our plants may be interrupted or slowed  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
we purchase fuel  including coal  natural gas and uranium  from a number of suppliers 
disruption in the delivery of fuel or environmental regulations affecting any of our fuel suppliers could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
in addition  the markets for coal  natural gas and uranium are subject to price fluctuations  availability restrictions and counterparty default 
it is not possible to predict the cost or availability of these commodities 
such costs  if not recovered in our prices  could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial results 
we are subject to complex governmental regulation that could require us to incur additional expenses or subject us to penalties 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 
new laws or regulations  the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations  or penalties imposed for non compliance with existing laws or regulations may require us to incur additional expenses  which could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial results 

table of contents we could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards  which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
as a result of the energy policy act of  owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system  including westar energy and kge  are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by ferc 
if we are found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards  we could be subject to sanctions  including substantial monetary penalties  which we may not be able to recover in the prices we charge our customers 
this could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial results 
our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the future cost of compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  water quality  the use of water  the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes  natural resources  and health and safety 
compliance with these legal requirements  which change frequently and often become more restrictive  requires us to commit significant capital and operating resources toward permitting  emission fees  environmental monitoring  installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchases of air emission allowances and or offsets 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  if not recovered in our prices  could adversely affect our consolidated financial results  especially if emission and or discharge limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increases 
we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty due to our inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of environmental rules or regulations 
we may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to concerns about climate change  which could require us to incur substantial costs 
we emit large amounts of co and other gases through the operation of our power plants 
federal legislation has been in the past and may in the future be introduced in congress to regulate the emission of ghgs and numerous states have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce ghg emissions 
additionally  the epa is proceeding with regulation of ghgs under the clean air act 
under epa regulations finalized in may  the epa began regulating ghg emissions from certain stationary sources  such as power plants  in january under the regulations  any source that emits at least  tons per year of ghgs will be required to have a title v operating permit under the clean air act 
sources that already have a title v permit would have ghg provisions added to their permit upon renewal 
additionally  psd permits for new major sources of ghg emissions and ghg sources that undergo major modifications on or after january   will require the implementation of the bact for the control of ghg emissions 
the epa has issued guidance on what bact entails for the control of ghgs and individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case by case basis 
these regulations could have a material impact on our operations or require us to incur substantial costs 
furthermore  in december  the epa announced it will be proposing ghg nsps rules for power plants and refineries 
the rules for power plants will be proposed by july  and finalized by may these rules would apply to new and existing facilities  including ours 
because these regulations have yet to be proposed  we cannot predict the impact they may have on our generating facilities or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 

table of contents our cost of compliance with future federal regulations relating to the disposal of ccbs could require us to incur substantial costs 
in the course of operations  many of our facilities generate ccbs  including fly ash and bottom ash  requiring disposal or processing 
on june   the epa published in the federal register a proposed rule to regulate ccbs under rcra 
the proposed rule provides two possible options for ccb regulation  one of which would subject ccbs to increased regulation as special waste under subtitle c of rcra 
while the impact and cost associated with the potential future regulation of ccbs cannot be established until such regulations are finalized  such regulations could have a material impact on our operations and or require us to incur substantial costs 
our risk management policies cannot eliminate price volatility and counterparty credit risks associated with our energy marketing activities 
we engage in energy marketing transactions with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we operate in active wholesale markets that expose us to price volatility for electricity and fuel and other commodities 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimates of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could cause significant earnings variability 
in addition  we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail to perform their obligations to make payments or deliveries 
defaults by suppliers or other counterparties may adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
we attempt to manage our exposure to price volatility and counterparty credit risk through application of established risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 
we are exposed to various risks associated with the ownership and operation of wolf creek  any of which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
through kge s ownership interest in wolf creek  we are subject to the risks of nuclear generation  which include the risks associated with storing  handling and disposing of radioactive materials and the current lack of a long term disposal solution for radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations  uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning wolf creek at the end of its life  and costs of measures associated with public safety 
the nrc has authority to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
revised safety requirements enacted by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
in addition  the institute of nuclear power operations inpo reviews wolf creek operations and facilities 
compliance with inpo recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses at wolf creek being passed through to kge 
if an incident did occur at wolf creek  it could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial results 
furthermore  the non compliance of other nuclear facilities operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident at other facilities could result in increased regulation of the industry as a whole  which could in turn increase wolf creek s compliance costs and impact our consolidated financial results 

table of contents in addition  in the event of an extended or unscheduled outage at wolf creek  we would be required to generate power from more costly generating units  purchase power in the open market to replace the power normally produced at wolf creek and have less power available for sale into the wholesale markets 
if we were unable to recover these costs from customers  such events would likely have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
events could occur that would change the accounting principles for regulated utilities currently applicable to our business  which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
we currently apply accounting principles that are unique to regulated entities 
as of december   we had recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million 
in the event we determined that we could no longer apply these principles  either as i a result of the establishment of retail competition in our service territory  ii a change in the regulatory approach for setting our prices from cost based ratemaking to another form of ratemaking  iii a result of other regulatory actions that restrict cost recovery to a level insufficient to recover costs  or iv a change from current generally accepted accounting principles gaap to another set of standards that does not recognize regulatory assets and or liabilities  then we may be required to record a charge against income in an amount up to the remaining unamortized regulatory assets 
such an action would materially reduce our shareholders equity 
we review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of these principles is appropriate each reporting period 
based upon our most current evaluation of the various factors that are expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe that our regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
equipment failures and other events beyond our control may cause extended or unplanned plant outages  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
the generation  distribution and transmission of electricity requires the use of expensive and complicated equipment  much of which is aged  and all of which requires significant ongoing maintenance 
although we maintain our power plants and equipment  they are still subject to extended or unplanned outages because of equipment failure  weather  transmission system disruption  operator error  contractor or subcontractor failure and other factors largely beyond our control 
in such events  we must either produce replacement power from our other units  which may be less efficient or more expensive to operate  or purchase power from others at unpredictable and potentially higher costs in order to meet our sales obligations 
such events could also limit our ability to make sales to customers 
therefore  the occurrence of extended or unplanned outages could adversely affect our consolidated financial results

executive summary overview we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately  customers in kansas under the regulation of the kcc 
we also provide electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in kansas under the regulation of ferc 
we have other contracts for the sale  purchase or exchange of wholesale electricity with other utilities 
in addition  we engage in energy marketing and purchase and sell electricity in areas outside of our retail service territory 
key factors affecting our performance the principal business  economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include weather conditions  customer conservation efforts  the economy  performance of our electric generating facilities and networks  conditions in the fuel  wholesale electricity and energy markets  rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental regulation  the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources  and capital market conditions 
strategy we expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated  regulated  electric utility 
we strive to optimize flexibility in our planning and operations to be able to respond to uncertain and changing conditions of all manner 
working constructively with our regulators and public officials is an important part of our strategy 
significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible and diverse energy supply portfolio 
in doing so  presently we are making environmental upgrades to our coal fired power plants  developing more wind generation and building and upgrading transmission facilities  in addition to developing systems and programs to help our customers use energy more efficiently 
following is a summary of recent progress we have made on significant elements of our strategy 
during  we made capital expenditures of million at our power plants to reduce regulated emissions 
along with third parties  in and we developed approximately mw of wind generation facilities at three different sites in kansas  approximately half of which we own and half of which we purchase the renewable energy produced under long term supply contracts 
we completed construction of a kv transmission line in central kansas in 
table of contents we are implementing smartstar lawrence  a smart grid project based in lawrence  kansas 
under this project  we will install advanced metering infrastructure equipment to give customers the ability to better monitor their energy use 
we qualified to receive a matching grant of approximately million from the doe  million of which we received in we expect the total project to cost approximately million 
our plans and expectations for and beyond include investing approximately billion at our power plants over the next three years to reduce regulated emissions 
on december   we announced that we reached two separate agreements with third parties  subject to regulatory approval  to purchase under year supply contracts the renewable energy produced from approximately mw of wind generation beginning in late we began constructing a mile kv transmission line in south central kansas 
upon receiving all necessary regulatory approvals  prairie wind transmission  llc  a joint venture company of which we own  intends to construct approximately miles of transmission facilities running from near wichita  kansas  southwest to a location near medicine lodge  kansas  and then south to the oklahoma border 
in addition to the transmission lines described above  subject to regulatory approvals  we plan to make significant capital expenditures to develop over the next decade additional transmission lines to strengthen kansas electrical transmission network 
we expect to continue improving our distribution system through vegetation management and other programs 
we expect to continue developing and expanding programs to help customers use energy more efficiently 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted or may impact us and our operations since january  we reported income from continuing operations of million and basic eps from continuing operations of for the year ended december   compared to income from continuing operations of million and basic eps from continuing operations of for the year ended december  see increase in income from continuing operations below  we experienced warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during this period was warmer than the same period in and warmer than the year average 
warmer weather was the key contributor to the increase in retail electricity sales in  economic conditions in our service territory  particularly related to some of our largest customers  showed signs of improvement in see economic conditions below for additional information  we made capital expenditures of million during see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information  
table of contents westar energy issued million shares of common stock for million under a sales agency financing agreement and entered into forward sale transactions with respect to an aggregate of million shares 
westar energy partially settled the forward sale transactions by delivering approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  for additional information 
increase in income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased million in compared to due primarily to higher retail revenues 
the increase in retail revenues was due principally to higher electricity sales  which were the result primarily of warmer weather and higher industrial electricity sales  and price increases 
economic conditions economic conditions in our service territory showed signs of improvement in most notably  some of our commercial and industrial customers experienced increased orders and production  although not to levels experienced prior to the economic downturn 
as a result  demand for electricity was higher in compared to as evidenced by the and increases in commercial and industrial electricity sales  respectively 
we cannot predict when or if the economy may fully recover from the economic downturn or to what extent economic volatility may affect our consolidated financial results 
current trends environmental regulation environmental laws and regulations affecting power plants  which relate primarily to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes  continue to evolve and have become more stringent over time 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with existing and new environmental laws and regulations 
while certain of these costs are recoverable through the ecrr  we cannot assure that all such costs will be recoverable in a timely manner from customers 
a recent order of the kcc indicated that it may be more appropriate to recover environmental costs at la cygne through the filing of a general rate case as opposed to the ecrr 
this could increase the time between making these investments and having them reflected in the prices we charge our customers  as well as the amount we charge our customers 
our anticipated capital expenditures at la cygne for environmental equipment for through are million 
greenhouse gases under epa regulations finalized in may  known as the tailoring rule  the epa began regulating ghg emissions from certain stationary sources in january the regulations are being implemented pursuant to two federal clear air act programs the title v operating permit program and the program requiring a permit if undergoing construction or major modifications  which is referred to as psd 
obligations relating to title v permits will include recordkeeping and monitoring requirements 
with respect to psd permits  projects that cause a significant increase in ghg emissions currently defined to be more than  tons or more per year or  tons or more per year  depending on various factors  will be required to implement bact 
the epa has issued guidance on what bact entails for the control of ghgs and individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case by case basis 
we cannot at this time determine the impact of these new regulations on our operations and consolidated financial results  but we believe the cost of compliance with new regulations could be material 
in december  the epa announced it will be proposing ghg nsps rules for power plants and refineries 
the rules for power plants will be proposed by july  and finalized by may these rules would apply to new and existing facilities  including ours 
because these regulations have yet to be proposed  we cannot predict the impact they may have on our generating facilities or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 

table of contents regulation of coal combustion byproducts in the course of operating our coal generation plants  we produce ccbs  including fly ash and bottom ash  which we must handle  dispose  recycle or process 
we recycle approximately of our fly ash and bottom ash production  principally by selling to the aggregate industry 
this is referred to as beneficial use 
on june   the epa published in the federal register a proposed rule to regulate ccbs under the rcra 
the proposed rule provides two possible options for ccb regulation  both of which technically would allow for the continued beneficial use of ccbs  but we believe might actually curtail or impair beneficial use to the extent we are able to recycle it today 
the first option would subject ccbs to regulation as special waste under subtitle c of rcra 
the second option would regulate ccbs as non hazardous solid waste under subtitle d of rcra and impose national criteria applicable to ccbs disposed of in landfills and surface impoundments 
while we cannot at this time estimate the impact and cost associated with future regulations of ccbs  we believe the impact on our operations and consolidated financial results could be material 
air emissions coal contains mercury 
when we combust coal at our generating facilities  we emit mercury into the air 
the federal camr permanently caps and reduces nationwide mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants 
in  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated camr 
in lieu of camr  the epa has announced that it intends to propose air toxics standards under the clean air act  including mercury standards  for coal and oil fired electric generating units by march and to finalize a rule by november without knowing what the rule will require  we cannot estimate the impact to us 
however  our costs to comply with future mercury emission requirements could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 
in july  the epa proposed catr  which would require the district of columbia and states  including kansas  to issue regulations and develop a plan by which power plants in their respective jurisdictions will further reduce emissions of so and nox 
reductions would be required beginning in  with further reductions likely to be required in the epa expects catr to be finalized in the spring of  but it is unclear when the states would issue implementing regulations 
there are a number of uncertainties relating to this proposed rule  including whether it will be finalized and how the states will implement the requirements 
as a result  we cannot determine the impact this rule will have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
national ambient air quality standards particulate matter  principally ash  is a byproduct of coal combustion 
in  the particulate matter naaqs are scheduled for their required five year review  at which time the epa could issue more stringent standards 
we cannot at this time predict the impact of any new standards on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
the epa is currently in the process of revising the naaqs for ozone 
the epa has requested additional time to finalize the ozone naaqs  which are expected to be issued in july if these revisions result in more stringent standards  we could be required to place additional nox pollution control measures on our facilities 
without knowing the new ozone standards  we cannot determine the impact they may have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
wastewater effluent some water used in our operations is discharged as wastewater effluent 
this wastewater may contain heavy metals and other substances deemed to be pollutants 
the epa plans to propose revisions to the rules governing such wastewater effluent from coal fired power plants by july with final action on the proposed rules expected to occur by january although we cannot at this time determine the impact of any new regulations  more stringent regulations could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 

table of contents renewable energy standard in may  kansas enacted legislation that mandates  among other requirements  that more energy be derived from renewable sources 
in years through net renewable generation capacity must be of the average peak demand for the three prior years  subject to limited exceptions 
this requirement increases to for years through and for and thereafter 
we have worked with third parties to develop approximately mw of qualifying wind generation facilities  which together with the use of renewable energy credits  we expect to meet the requirement 
on december   we announced that we reached two separate agreements with third parties  subject to regulatory approval  to purchase under year supply contracts the renewable energy produced from approximately mw of wind generation beginning in late we expect these agreements  along with our prior development of wind generation facilities  will satisfy our net renewable generation requirement through and contribute toward meeting the increased requirement beginning in we expect to continue to develop renewable energy sources  which we anticipate being primarily wind generation  to meet regulatory and legal requirements as well as to diversify our generating fleet 
allowance for funds used during construction allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity 
we compute afudc by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress 
we credit to other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds the amount of afudc capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect both afudc for borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we execute our capital expenditure program 
interest expense we expect interest expense to increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program 
we believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers  as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make 
in addition  short term interest rates are extremely low by historic standards 
we cannot predict to what extent these conditions will persist 
outstanding shares of common stock we expect the number of outstanding shares of westar energy common stock to increase over the next several years as we settle our forward sale agreements and or issue additional shares to fund our capital expenditure program 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  for additional information regarding our forward sale agreements 

table of contents accounting changes the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working on several projects including  among others  revenue recognition  leases  financial instruments  fair value measurements and insurance contracts  in an effort to both improve us gaap and converge us gaap with international financial reporting standards 
these projects could significantly change accounting guidance in these areas over the next few years 
although we cannot predict the impact that such accounting changes might have on our consolidated financial results  it could be material 
outlook in  we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach 
we anticipate price increases in the form of permitted formula adjustments 
we have no way of predicting the weather and  as a result  assume for planning purposes that weather will revert to its historic average 
for  this means that we anticipate lower residential and commercial electricity sales than in we expect a slight increase in industrial electricity sales under the assumption that economic conditions will continue to improve 
we anticipate operating and maintenance as well as selling  general and administrative expenses to trend in line with historic labor increases and inflation rates 
we expect depreciation expense to increase in as a result of plant additions during the year 
furthermore  we expect to contribute million to our pension and post retirement benefit plans and wolf creek s pension plan in we plan to increase capital spending in as provided under future cash requirements below 
to fund such capital investments  we will issue additional shares of common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock 
we may also issue debt 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
were we to deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
as of december   we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately million and regulatory liabilities of million  as discussed in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
we believe that it is probable that our regulatory assets will be recovered in the future 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by applicable gaap 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
changes in these assumptions will result in changes to regulatory assets  regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and other post retirement liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
such changes may also require cash contributions

table of contents revenue recognition electricity sales we record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers 
we determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we had estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  energy marketing contracts we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the fair value method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of certain fuel supply and electricity contracts  which we record as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities  we include the net change in fair value in revenues on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
normal purchases and normal sales exception determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires that we exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that we ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements 
revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed 
contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which physical delivery is probable  quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and price is not tied to an unrelated underlying derivative 

table of contents the table below shows the fair value of energy marketing contracts outstanding as of december  fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  b a approximately million and million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts were recognized as a regulatory asset and regulatory liability  respectively 
b approximately million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts was recognized as a regulatory liability 
the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts and the maturity periods of the contracts as of december   are summarized in the following table 
fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity over years dollars in thousands prices actively quoted futures prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on option pricing models options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a options are priced using a series of techniques  such as the black option pricing model 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices 
we recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we record deferred tax assets to carry forward into future periods capital losses  operating losses and tax credits 
however  when we believe based on available evidence that we do not  or will not  have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the application of income tax law is complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous 
accordingly  we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes 

table of contents asset retirement obligations legal liability we have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of the asset retirement obligation aro is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
we estimate our aros based on the fair value of the aros we incurred at the time the related long lived assets were either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective 
we initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek our share  retire our wind generating facilities  dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants  remediate ash disposal ponds and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil 
in determining our aros  we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the aros reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we have recorded aros of million and million  respectively 
for additional information on our legal aros  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
non legal liability cost of removal we recover in our prices the costs to dispose of plant assets that do not represent legal retirement obligations 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in amounts collected  but not yet spent  for removal costs classified as a regulatory liability 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies and legal proceedings  for more detailed information 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on eps 
we have various classifications of revenues  defined as follows retail sales of electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
classification of customers as residential  commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies 
assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification 
other retail sales of electricity for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
wholesale sales of electricity to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by ferc authority 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts for the sale of such electricity that have yet to settle 
margins realized from sales based on prevailing market prices generally serve to offset our retail prices and the cost based prices charged to certain wholesale customers 

table of contents transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on tariffs with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
this category also includes energy marketing transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets  changes in valuations of related contracts and fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties 
electric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation  fuel costs  customer conservation efforts  the economy and competitive forces 
changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal 
as a summer peaking utility  the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among residential customers 
mild weather reduces customer demand 
our wholesale revenues are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity  transmission availability and weather 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow

in  our spp network transmission costs were million 
this amount  less million retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
b cannot divide by zero 

table of contents gross margin fuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs 
as permitted by regulators  we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power 
fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by ferc 
as a result  changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income 
for this reason  we believe gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next 
we calculate gross margin as total revenues less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and spp network transmission costs 
transmission costs reflect the costs of providing network transmission service 
accordingly  in calculating gross margin  we recognize the net value of this transmission activity as shown in the table immediately following 
however  we record transmission costs as operating and maintenance expense on our consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands revenues residential commercial industrial other retail total retail revenues wholesale transmission other total revenues less fuel and purchased power expense spp network transmission costs gross margin the following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended december  and no electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total gross margin increased in compared to due principally to an increase in total retail revenues 
of the million increase in total retail revenues  was attributable to higher electricity sales and was due to higher prices as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
retail electricity sales increased due primarily to the effects of warmer weather  which particularly impacted residential electricity sales  and for reasons we believe to be principally related to improved economic conditions 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than and warmer than the year average 
while weather also affects commercial and industrial customers  those electricity sales typically are not as sensitive to weather as residential electricity sales 
we believe improving economic conditions are why some of our commercial and industrial customers experienced increased orders and production in  which lead to increased electricity sales to them 
economic conditions generally have not recovered to levels experienced prior to the economic downturn 

table of contents income from operations is the most directly comparable measure to gross margin that is calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our consolidated statements of income 
our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations 
additionally  our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due primarily to higher spp network transmission costs of million  which were offset by higher spp network transmission revenues of million  higher power plant maintenance costs of million and higher maintenance costs of million for our electrical distribution system 
the higher power plant maintenance costs were due primarily to higher costs at wolf creek and our wind generation facilities while the increase in maintenance costs for our electrical distribution system was due principally to additional tree trimming and other line clearance activities in offsetting these increases was a million reduction resulting from the consolidation of vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  and a million reduction in our maximum liability for environmental remediation costs associated with assets we divested many years ago 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily to reflect the addition of wind generation facilities  new generating plant  air quality controls at our power plants and other plant additions 
we also recorded additional depreciation expense of million as a result of consolidating vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense a significant amount of our non union  non executive employee compensation is at risk to employees and  therefore  payable only in the event we meet pre established operating and financial objectives 
likewise  under our executive long term incentive and share award plan  shares are issued only when certain service conditions are met and or we meet pre established financial objectives 
in we adjusted these compensation plans to better align compensation with our financial performance 
selling  general and administrative expense increased due principally to higher compensation expense of million that was primarily the result of the aforementioned plan adjustments and our improved financial performance 
this increase was partially offset by our having recorded a million expense in related to the settlement of the epa lawsuit discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings investment earnings decreased due principally to our having recorded lower gains on investments held in a trust to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded gains on these investments of million in compared to gains of million recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest expense interest expense increased due primarily to our having recorded additional interest expense of million as a result of consolidating vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  and interest on additional debt issued in june to fund capital investments

year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total the increase in gross margin in compared to was due principally to the increase in total retail revenues 
total retail revenues increased primarily as a result of price increases authorized by the kcc  which more than offset the decrease in total retail electricity sales 
the decreases in both residential and commercial electricity sales were attributable primarily to cooler weather  particularly during the third quarter of as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during the third quarter of was cooler than the same period in and cooler than the year average 
industrial electricity sales decreased due principally to the effects of recessionary conditions that served to reduce industrial demand for electricity 
in addition  wholesale revenues decreased compared to due principally to a lower average market price for these sales that was the result primarily of reduced demand and lower natural gas prices 
substantially all of the margins realized on these electricity sales are returned to our customers

table of contents operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due primarily to a million increase in spp network transmission costs  which was offset by higher transmission revenues of million 
maintenance expense increased million due principally to a million increase in amounts expensed for previously deferred storm costs and higher maintenance costs of million for our new generating facilities 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense we completed a number of large construction projects in and consequently  depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of these plant additions 
during  we recorded depreciation expense of million for emporia energy center  million for wind generation facilities and million for various transmission projects 
during  we recorded depreciation expense of million for emporia energy center and million for the same transmission projects described above 
we did not record any depreciation expense for the wind generation facilities in because they were not yet in service 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in pension and other employee benefit costs 
in addition  we recorded a million expense related to the settlement of the epa lawsuit discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest expense in  we reversed million of accrued interest associated with uncertain income tax positions  which reduced interest expense 
we did not record such a reversal in and  as a result  our interest expense was higher 
absent this reversal  interest expense increased million in compared to due principally to interest on additional debt issued to fund capital investments 
contributing to the increase was our having recorded million less for capitalized interest as a result of completing several large construction projects in these factors were offset partially by a million decrease in interest related to lower interest rates and less borrowing under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense    a a change greater than 
in  we recognized million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions and million in state tax credits related to investments and jobs creation within the state of kansas  both of which decreased income tax expense 
we did not recognize similar income tax benefits in continuing operations in financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  as a result of consolidating the vies discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  we had recorded as of december   property  plant and equipment of variable interest entities  net  of million  current maturities of long term debt of variable interest entities of million and long term debt of variable interest entities  net  of million 
the fair market value of energy marketing contracts increased million to million at december  this was due principally to the settlement of a fuel supply contract that was recorded as a million liability at december  changes in the measurement of this fuel supply contract have an offsetting impact to regulatory assets 
tax receivable decreased million due principally to the receipt of federal and state tax refunds related to the settlement of prior tax years 
regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  decreased million to million at december   from million at december  total regulatory assets increased million due primarily to a million increase in accrued employee benefits and million increase due to the accumulation of energy efficiency costs 
increases were offset by million amortization of deferred storm costs  million decrease in previously deferred fuel expense  million decrease in net amounts due from customers for future income taxes and million amortization of previously deferred amounts for a wolf creek refueling and maintenance outage 
total regulatory liabilities increased million due principally to a million increase resulting from the increase in the fair value measurement of our ndt assets  million resulting from consolidating our leasehold interest in la cygne unit and a million increase in the fair value measurement of a treasury yield hedge we entered into in anticipation of a future debt issuance 
increases to regulatory liabilities were partially offset by an million decrease in our refund obligation related to the reca 

table of contents short term debt decreased million due principally to increased cash receipts from customers  the above mentioned tax refund and the issuance of common stock 
other current liabilities increased million  other long term liabilities decreased million and current deferred tax assets increased million due primarily to a change in the status of legal proceedings involving two former executives who we dismissed in in  the us government dismissed criminal charges against them which allowed for the resumption of an arbitration proceeding against them which had previously been stayed pending resolution of the criminal charges 
we expect arbitration to conclude within the next year 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
deferred income taxes increased million due principally to the recording of tax benefits resulting from the use of accelerated depreciation methods  including million resulting from the extension of the bonus depreciation tax provisions 
unamortized investment tax credits decreased million since we do not expect to realize all of the state investment tax credits prior to expiration that we earned on investments in plant located in the state of kansas 
accrued employee benefits increased million due primarily to a higher projected benefit obligation for our and wolf creek s pension plans 
we recognize as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability the difference between the fair value of pension and post retirement benefit plan assets and the liabilities for pension and post retirement benefit plans 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and wolf creek employee benefit plans  respectively  for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources overview available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash  westar energy s revolving credit facilities and access to capital markets 
we expect to meet our day to day cash requirements including  among other items  fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions  using primarily internally generated cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
to meet the cash requirements for our capital investments  we expect to use internally generated cash  borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets 
we also use proceeds from the issuance of securities to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facilities  with such borrowed amounts principally related to investments in capital equipment  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the aforementioned sources and uses of cash are similar to our historical activities 
for additional information on our future cash requirements  see future cash requirements below 
during  we plan to increase our capital spending and expect to contribute to our pension trust 
we continue to believe that we will have the ability to pay dividends 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include  among others factors affecting revenues described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets 

table of contents capital structure as of december  and  our capital structure  excluding short term debt  was as follows common equity preferred stock noncontrolling interests long term debt a a includes long term debt of vies in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  for additional information 
short term borrowings westar energy has a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that terminates on march  as discussed above  we use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund investments in capital equipment and to help meet our day to day cash requirements including  among other items  fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions 
as of february   million had been borrowed and an additional million of letters of credit had been issued under the revolving credit facility 
on january   ferc approved our request for authority to issue short term securities in an aggregate amount up to billion including  without limitation  by increasing the size of westar energy s revolving credit facility 
in february  westar energy entered into a new revolving credit facility with a similar syndicate of banks for an additional million 
the commitments under this facility terminate in february a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than at all times 
at december   our ratio was 
available liquidity under the facilities is not impacted by a decline in westar energy s credit ratings 
debt financing the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
under the westar energy mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  so long as any bonds issued prior to january   remain outstanding  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 

table of contents under the kge mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
some of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the agreements 
we calculate these ratios in accordance with our credit agreements 
these ratios are used solely to determine compliance with our various debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  as of december   we had million of variable rate  tax exempt bonds 
interest rates payable under these bonds are normally set by auctions  which occur every days 
however  auctions for these bonds have failed over the past few years  resulting in volatile alternative index based interest rates for these bonds 
with the kcc s approval  on october   kge refinanced million of auction rate bonds at a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of june  we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to our remaining auction rate bonds 
on august   westar energy repaid million principal amount of unsecured senior notes with borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
on june   kge issued million principal amount of first mortgage bonds at a discount yielding  bearing stated interest at and maturing on june  kge received net proceeds of million 
in addition  kge amended its mortgage and deed of trust  dated april   as supplemented  in june to increase the maximum amount of kge first mortgage bonds authorized to be issued from billion to billion 
proceeds from the issuance of first mortgage bonds were used to repay borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility  with such borrowed amounts principally related to investments in capital equipment  as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
impact of credit ratings on debt financing moody s investors service moody s  standard poor s ratings group s p and fitch investors service fitch are independent credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities 
these ratings indicate each agency s assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities 
in general  less favorable credit ratings make borrowing more difficult and costly 
under westar energy s revolving credit facilities our cost of borrowing is determined in part by credit ratings 
however  westar energy s ability to borrow under the revolving credit facilities is not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating 
we may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions  which could affect our liquidity and or our borrowing costs 
factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
objective criteria include typical financial ratios  such as total debt to total capitalization and funds from operations to total debt  among others  future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit 
subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management  the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices

common stock issuance westar energy s articles of incorporation  as amended  provide for  authorized shares of common stock 
as of december   we had  shares issued and outstanding 
through a sales agency financing agreement entered into with a broker dealer subsidiary of a bank in  westar energy sold million shares of common stock for million in and million shares of common stock for million in westar energy did not sell any shares of common stock under this agreement during during  westar energy entered into two separate forward sale agreements with banks 
the use of a forward sale agreement allows westar energy the means to minimize equity market uncertainty by pricing a common stock offering under then existing market conditions while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of common stock until funds are needed 
westar energy is also better able to match the timing of its financing needs with its capital investment and regulatory plans 
the forward sale transactions are entered into at market prices  therefore  the forward sale agreements have no initial fair value 
westar energy will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock under the forward sale agreements until transactions are settled 
upon settlement  westar energy will record the forward sale agreements within equity 
except in specified circumstances or events that would require physical share settlement  westar energy is able to elect to settle any forward sale transactions by means of physical share  cash or net share settlement  and is also able to elect to settle the forward sale transactions in whole  or in part  earlier than the stated maturity dates 
currently  westar energy anticipates settling the forward sale transactions through physical share settlement 
the shares under the forward sale agreements were initially priced when the agreements were entered into and are subject to certain fixed pricing adjustments during the term of the agreements 
accordingly  assuming physical share settlement  westar s net proceeds from the forward sale transactions will represent the prices established by the forward sale agreements applicable to the time periods in which physical settlement occurs 

table of contents westar energy entered into one such forward sale agreement on november  under the terms of the agreement  the bank  as forward seller  borrowed million shares of westar energy s common stock from third parties and sold them to a group of underwriters for per share 
under an over allotment option included in the agreement  the underwriters purchased approximately million additional shares on november   also for per share  which increased the total number of shares under the forward sale agreement to approximately million shares 
the underwriters receive a commission equal to of the sales price of all shares sold under the agreement 
westar energy must settle the forward sale agreement within months of the transaction date 
assuming physical share settlement of this agreement at december   westar energy would have received aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of commission  based on an average forward price of per share 
on april   westar energy entered into a new  three year sales agency financing agreement and forward sale agreement 
the maximum amount that westar energy may offer and sell under the agreements is the lesser of an aggregate of million or approximately million shares  subject to adjustment for share splits  share combinations and share dividends 
under the terms of the sales agency financing agreement  westar energy may offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through the broker dealer subsidiary  as agent 
the broker dealer receives a commission equal to of the sales price of all shares sold under the agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the sales agency financing agreement and forward sale agreement  westar energy may from time to time enter into one or more forward sale transactions with the bank  as forward purchaser  and the bank will borrow shares of westar energy s common stock from third parties and sell them through its broker dealer 
westar energy must settle the forward sale transactions within a year of the date each transaction is entered 
as of december   westar energy had entered into forward sale transactions with respect to an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock 
as partial settlement of the forward sale transactions  westar energy delivered approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million on october  on december   westar energy delivered approximately million additional shares for proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale transactions 
assuming physical share settlement of the approximately million remaining shares of common stock at december   westar energy would have received aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of commission  based on an average forward price of per share 
on february   westar energy delivered approximately million shares of common stock and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale transactions discussed above 
on may   westar energy entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of million shares of its common stock 
on june   westar energy issued all million shares and received million in total proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and fees related to the offering 
in  westar energy also completed a forward sale agreement entered into in november by delivering million shares of common stock for proceeds of million 
westar energy used the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility  with such borrowed amounts principally related to investments in capital equipment  as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million of cash in compared with cash provided from operating activities of million during this increase was due primarily to our having received million more in customer receipts and our having received million more in net tax refunds 
with the consolidation of the vies discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  a portion of lease payments previously reported as operating cash flows is now reported as financing cash flows  which resulted in about a million increase in operating cash flows 
in addition  we contributed million less to the westar energy pension trust  westar energy post retirement benefit plan and wolf creek pension trust  and during  we paid million more for our share of wolf creek s refueling outage 
partially offsetting these increases was our having paid in million more for fuel and purchased power and million more for interest on coli policies  which was the result of a policy change in the second quarter of under which we no longer pay interest on such policies in advance 
operating activities provided million of cash in the year ended december   compared with cash provided from operating activities of million during principal contributors to the increase were our having paid million less for fuel and purchased power and million less for interest on our coli policies 
partially offsetting increases were our having received million less in customer receipts during due primarily to lower cash receipts from our wholesale customers  which more than offset higher cash receipts from our retail customers and our having paid million more in interest on debt 
cash flows used in investing activities our principal use of cash for investing purposes relates to growing and improving our utility plant 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant ongoing investment in plant 
we invested million in  million in and million in in additions to property  plant and equipment 
the decrease from to was due principally to the completion of air quality improvements to power plants  wind generation projects  transmission projects and the construction of emporia energy center  which required significant amounts of cash in cash flows used in from financing activities financing activities used million of cash in we used cash to pay million in dividends  repay million of long term debt including vies and repay million of short term debt 
borrowings from coli provided million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million 
we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million and proceeds from short term debt provided million 
we used cash to repay million of long term debt and to pay million in dividends 
we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million and borrowings from coli provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends and to retire million of long term debt 
cash flows used in investing activities of discontinued operations in  we paid protection one  inc million for its share of the net tax benefit related to the net operating loss carryforward arising from our sale of that company 

table of contents future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect to need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service  which include  but are not limited to  expenditures for environmental improvements at our coal fired power plants  new transmission lines and other improvements to our power plants  transmission and distribution lines  and equipment 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facilities and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
changes to environmental regulations could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect our company and industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits could cause a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations 
on january   we announced a settlement with the doj of a pending lawsuit over allegations regarding environmental air regulations 
the settlement was filed with the court  seeking its approval  and on march   the court entered an order approving the settlement 
the settlement requires that we install an scr on one of the three jec coal units by the end of we estimate the cost of this to be approximately million 
this amount could change materially depending on final engineering and design 
depending on the nox emission reductions attained by the single scr and attainable through the installation of other controls on the other two jec coal units  we may have to install an scr on another jec unit by the end of  if needed to meet nox reduction targets 
recovery of costs to install these systems is subject to the approval of our regulators 
we believe these costs are appropriate for inclusion in the prices we are allowed to charge our customers 
we will also invest million over six years in environmental mitigation projects that we will own 
in  we recorded as part of the settlement million for environmental mitigation projects that will be owned by a qualifying third party and a million civil penalty 
capital expenditures for and anticipated capital expenditures  including costs of removal  for through are shown in the following table

b net of doe matching grant 

table of contents we prepare these estimates for planning purposes and revise them from time to time 
actual expenditures will differ  perhaps materially  from our estimates due to changing environmental requirements  changing costs  delays in engineering  construction or permitting  changes in the availability and cost of capital  and other factors discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we and our generating plant co owners periodically evaluate these estimates and this may result in frequent and possibly material changes in actual costs 
in addition  these amounts do not include any estimates for potentially new environmental requirements 
over the next several years  we will also need significant amounts of cash to meet our long term debt obligations 
the principal amounts of our long term debt maturities as of december   are as follows 
long term debt long term debt of vies year in thousands thereafter total maturities pension obligation in accordance with a september kcc order  we expect to fund our pension plan each year at least to a level equal to our current year pension expense 
we must also meet minimum funding requirements under the employee retirement income security act  as amended by the pension protection act 
we may contribute additional amounts from time to time as deemed appropriate 
we contributed to our pension trust million in and million in we expect to contribute approximately million in in and  we also funded million and million  respectively  of wolf creek s pension plan contributions 
in  we expect to fund million of wolf creek s pension plan contributions

off balance sheet arrangements as discussed under common stock issuance above and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  westar energy entered into two separate forward sale agreements with banks in the forward sale agreements are off balance sheet arrangements 
we also have off balance sheet arrangements in the form of operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we did not have any additional off balance sheet arrangements as of december  for additional information on operating leases  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases 
see commercial commitments below for additional information regarding our letters of credit 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the course of our business activities  we enter into a variety of contracts and commercial commitments 
some of these result in direct obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  not reflected in our underlying consolidated financial statements

the letters of credit are comprised of million related to worker s compensation  million related to new transmission projects  million related to energy marketing and trading activities  and million related to other operating activities  for a total outstanding balance of million 

table of contents other information changes in prices in february  we filed an application with the kcc to adjust our prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in our transmission formula rate discussed below 
if approved  we estimate that the new prices will increase our annual retail revenues by million 
we expect the kcc to issue an order on our request in march on october   the kcc issued an order  effective november  allowing us to recover in our prices million of previously deferred amounts associated with various energy efficiency programs 
on october   we posted our updated transmission formula rate which includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs 
the updated rate was effective january   and is expected to increase our annual transmission revenues by million 
on june   the kcc issued a final order approving an adjustment to our prices that we made earlier in the adjustment included updated transmission costs as reflected in our transmission formula rate discussed below 
the new prices were effective march   and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by million 
on may   the kcc issued an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include costs associated with environmental investments made in the new prices were effective june   and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by million 
on january   the kcc issued an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include costs associated with investments in natural gas and wind generation facilities 
the new prices were effective february and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by million 
our transmission formula rate that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs became effective january   and was expected to increase our annual transmission revenues by million 
the transmission formula rate provides the basis for our annual request with the kcc to adjust our retail prices to include updated transmission costs as noted above 
new financial regulation on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed into law 
although the dodd frank act is focused primarily on the regulation and oversight of financial institutions  it also calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets  including mandatory clearing of certain swaps  exchange trading  margin requirements and other transparency requirements  which could impact our operations and consolidated financial results 
as the implementing regulations for the dodd frank act have not yet been finalized  we cannot predict what such impact might be 
we will continue to evaluate the dodd frank act as more information becomes available 
stock based compensation we use two types of restricted share units rsus for our stock based compensation awards  those with service requirements and those with performance measures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to rsu awards with only service requirements was million as of december   and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted average period of years 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to rsu awards with performance measures was million as of december   and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted average period of years 
there were no modifications of awards during the years ended december   or 
table of contents new accounting pronouncements we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap for the united states of america 
to address current issues in accounting  the fasb issued the following new accounting pronouncement that affected our accounting and disclosure 
consolidation guidance for variable interest entities in june  the fasb amended the consolidation guidance for vies 
the amended guidance requires a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative assessment in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie and significantly changes the criteria to consider in determining the primary beneficiary 
pursuant to the amended guidance  there is no exclusion  or grandfathering  of vies that were not consolidated under prior guidance 
this amended guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we adopted the guidance effective january   and  as a result  began consolidating certain vies that hold assets we lease 
as a result  we added a significant amount of assets and liabilities to our consolidated balance sheets as discussed under operating results financial condition above 
in addition  such consolidation did not impact our net income and will not impact our net income going forward since net income of the vies is separately identified on our consolidated statements of income as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  for additional information 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy related products 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk we engage in both financial and physical trading with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including futures contracts  options and swaps 
within our energy trading portfolio  we may establish certain positions intended to economically hedge a portion of physical sale or purchase contracts and we may enter into certain positions attempting to take advantage of market trends and conditions 
we use the term economic hedge to mean a strategy intended to manage risks of volatility in prices or rate movements on selected assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions by creating a relationship in which gains or losses on derivative instruments are expected to offset the losses or gains on the assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to such market risks 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
additionally  net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have net open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
we use various types of fuel  including coal  natural gas  uranium  diesel and oil  to operate our plants and purchase power to meet customer demand 
we are exposed to market risks from commodity price changes for electricity and other energy related products and interest rates that could affect our consolidated financial results  including cash flows 
we attempt to manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when we deem appropriate  we economically hedge a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments for non trading purposes 
factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation  the availability of our power plants and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel we use to generate electricity fluctuate from period to period based on availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type  as well as planned and unscheduled outages at our generating plants that use fossil fuels 
our commodity price exposure is also affected by our nuclear plant refueling and maintenance schedule 
our customers electricity usage also varies based on weather  the economy and other factors 
the wholesale power and fuel markets are volatile 
this volatility impacts our costs of purchased power  fuel costs for our power plants and our participation in energy markets 
we trade various types of fuel primarily to reduce exposure related to the volatility of commodity prices 
a significant portion of our coal requirements is purchased under long term contracts to hedge much of the fuel exposure for customers 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 

table of contents one way by which we manage and measure the commodity price risk of our trading portfolio is by using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the future 
the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and a measure of volatility associated with potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period and a day historical observation period 
it is possible that actual results may differ markedly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposures 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  the financial condition of our counterparties and interest rate movement 
see the credit risk and interest rate risk discussions below for additional information 
also  there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 
credit risk we are exposed to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in rtos 
such credit risk is associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis pricing differentials  physical liquidity constraints and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties intended to reduce our overall credit risk 
we also employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to credit agency ratings of our senior unsecured debt 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to the provisions  could require collateralization on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december  and  was million and million  respectively  for which we had posted no collateral 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december  and  we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million and million  respectively  of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable 
interest rate risk we have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our variable interest rate exposure  utilizing various maturity dates and entering into treasury yield hedge transactions 
we may also use other financial derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

table of contents we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
interest rates payable under these bonds are normally set through periodic auctions 
however  conditions in the credit markets over the past few years caused a dramatic reduction in the demand for auction bonds  which lead to failed auctions 
the contractual provisions of these securities set forth an indexing formula method by which interest will be paid in the event of an auction failure 
depending on the level of these reference indices  our interest costs may be higher or lower than what they would have been had the securities been auctioned successfully 
additionally  should insurers of those bonds experience a decrease in their credit ratings  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs 
furthermore  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and negatively affect investment returns 
as of december   we had recorded a million gain on treasury yield hedge transactions with a total notional amount of million 
these transactions are measured at fair value by estimating the net present value of a series of payments using models with inputs such as the spread between the year us treasury bill yield and the contracted  fixed yield 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point decrease in the year us treasury bill yield would decrease the fair value of these transactions by approximately million  with a corresponding increase to regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities 
the impact of a change in market interest rates on these transactions at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such transactions are settled 
net gains or losses  to the extent realized  will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective debt issuance 
security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas statue  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   investments in the ndt fund were allocated to equity securities  to debt securities  to real estate securities and less than to cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the equity  debt and real estate securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the ndt fund as of december  we also maintain a trust to fund non qualified retirement benefits 
as of december   these funds were comprised of equity securities and debt securities 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the equity and debt securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the trust as of december  by maintaining diversified portfolios of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the aforementioned obligations within acceptable risk tolerances  including interest rate risk 
however  debt and equity securities in the portfolios are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligations rises 
we actively monitor the portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocations in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to security price risk related to the ndt fund is  in part  mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the prices we charge our customers
