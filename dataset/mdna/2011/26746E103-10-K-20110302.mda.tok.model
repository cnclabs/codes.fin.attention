item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs 
we currently have three major business elements we commercialize kalbitor ecallantide on our own in the united states for treatment of acute attacks of hae and are also developing kalbitor for use in other indications 
outside of the united states  we have established partnerships to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize kalbitor in other major markets and are evaluating opportunities in additional territories 
we leverage our proprietary phage display technology through our licensing and funded research program  or lfrp 
this program  which generated million in revenue in  has also resulted in a portfolio of product candidates being developed by our licensees 
this portfolio currently includes product candidates in clinical development 
to the extent that one or more of these product candidates are commercialized according to published timelines  we anticipate that revenues under the lfrp will increase substantially 
we continue to use our phage display technology to identify new drug candidates and advance others within our preclinical pipeline 
kalbitor and the ecallantide franchise in february  we began commercializing kalbitor in the united states for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we are commercializing kalbitor on our own in the united states  and working through corporate partners  we intend to seek approval for and commercialize kalbitor for hae and other angioedema indications in markets outside of the united states 
during  we entered into four separate agreements to develop and commercialize subcutaneous ecallantide for the treatment of hae and other therapeutic indications throughout europe  japan  north africa  the middle east  russia  australia  new zealand and israel 
we are also exploring the use of ecallantide for the treatment of drug induced angioedema  a life threatening inflammatory response brought on by adverse reactions to angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors 
in december  we filed an ind for this indication with the fda 
we plan to initiate a dose ranging phase clinical study and commence dosing of the first patients in the first half of in addition  we have licensed ecallantide for development through a collaboration with fovea pharmaceuticals sa  a subsidiary of sanofi aventis  for treatment of retinal diseases 
phage display licensing and funded research program we believe that our phage display libraries represent the gold standard for therapeutic development and we leverage our proprietary phage display technology through our lfrp licenses and collaborations 
this program currently generates significant revenues and has the potential for substantially greater revenues if and when product candidates that are discovered by our licensees receive marketing approval and are commercialized 
we have ongoing lfrp license agreements 
of the product candidates that are currently in clinical development under the lfrp portfolio  four are in phase  four are in phase and nine are in phase to the extent that these product candidates receive marketing approval and are commercialized according to published timelines  we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales beginning in furthermore  based on our own analysis as to the probability of receiving marketing approval and the large markets being addressed  we expect potential annual royalty revenues under the lfrp of more than million by several of our lfrp collaborations also provide us access to co develop and or co promote drug candidates identified by other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
to date we have received more than million  primarily related to license fees and milestones  in revenues under the lfrp 
in  we earned million  including an million buy out of one royalty obligation for xyntha  and we expect receipts under the lfrp to continue to grow as more products advance in clinical development 
in addition  under a loan arrangement with cowen healthcare  we obtained million in debt funding  secured exclusively by the lfrp 
this debt  which has a current principal balance of million  is being repaid from a portion of lfrp receipts  is required to be repaid in full by  and may be prepaid without penalty in august dyax pipeline we are also developing a pipeline of drug candidates using our phage display technology 
we use phage display to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds with therapeutic potential for development in our own internal programs 
these preclinical drug candidates may be developed independently or through strategic partnerships with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
although we will continue to seek to retain ownership and control of our internally discovered drug candidates by taking them further into preclinical and clinical development  we will also partner certain candidates in order to balance the risks associated with drug discovery and maximize return for our stockholders 
kalbitor and the ecallantide franchise ecallantide is a compound that we developed using our phage display technology  which we have shown in vitro to be a high affinity  high specificity inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein 
plasma kallikrein  an enzyme found in blood  is believed to be a key component responsible for the regulation of the inflammation and coagulation pathways 
excess plasma kallikrein activity is thought to play a role in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  including hae 
hae is a rare  genetic disorder characterized by severe  debilitating and often painful swelling  which can occur in the abdomen  face  hands  feet and airway 
hae is caused by low or dysfunctional levels of c inh  a naturally occurring molecule that inhibits plasma kallikrein  a key mediator of inflammation  and other serine proteases in the blood 
it is estimated that hae affects between in  to in  people around the world 
despite the fact that of patients experience symptoms before age  of patients are not diagnosed until after age  which makes it difficult to accurately determine the size of the hae patient population 
hae patient association registries estimate there is an immediately addressable target population of approximately  patients in the united states 
kalbitor in december  ecallantide was approved by the fda under the brand name kalbitor for treatment of hae in patients years of age and older regardless of anatomic location 
kalbitor  a potent  selective and reversible plasma kallikrein inhibitor discovered and developed by us  is the first subcutaneous hae treatment approved in the united states 
as part of product approval  we have established a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems program to communicate the risk of anaphylaxis and the importance of distinguishing between hypersensitivity reaction and hae attack symptoms 
to communicate these risks  the rems requires a medication guide be dispensed with each dose of kalbitor and a dear healthcare professional letter be provided to doctors identified as likely to prescribe kalbitor and treat hae patients 
we have also initiated a phase observational study which will be conducted with hae patients to evaluate immunogenicity and hypersensitivity with exposure to kalbitor for treatment of acute attacks of hae 
the study is designed to identify predictive risk factors and develop effective screening tools to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
this year study was initiated in february united states sales and marketing we have established a commercial organization to support sales of kalbitor in the united states 
we believe that a field based team of approximately professionals  consisting of sales representatives and corporate account directors  is appropriate to effectively market kalbitor in the united states at this time  where patients are treated primarily by a limited number of specialty physicians  consisting mainly of allergists and immunologists 
kalbitor accesssm in furtherance of our efforts to facilitate access to kalbitor in the united states  we have created the kalbitor access program  designed as a one stop point of contact for information about kalbitor  which offers treatment support service for patients with hae and their healthcare providers 
kalbitor case managers provide comprehensive product and disease information  treatment site coordination  financial assistance for qualified patients and reimbursement facilitation services 
distribution we have an exclusive relationship with three wholly owned subsidiaries of amerisourcebergen specialty group  inc absg to establish a distribution network for kalbitor 
our agreements with each subsidiary have an initial term of three years  although each contains customary termination provisions and may be terminated by us for any reason upon six months prior written notice 
this distribution network includes the following us bioservices corporation us bio  serves as our specialty pharmacy for kalbitor in the united states  and also administers kalbitor access  which provides comprehensive call center services for patients and healthcare providers seeking information and access to kalbitor  asd specialty healthcare inc asd  serves as our wholesale distributor for kalbitor to treating hospitals in the united states  and integrated commercialization solutions  inc ics  provides warehousing  inventory management and other logistical services in connection with the distribution of kalbitor throughout the united states 
manufacturing in connection with the commercial launch of kalbitor in the united states  we have established a commercial supply chain  consisting of single source third party suppliers to manufacture  test and distribute this product 
all third party manufacturers involved in the kalbitor manufacturing process are required to comply with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
to date  ecallantide drug substance used in the production of kalbitor has been manufactured in the united kingdom by msd biologics uk limited formerly known as avecia biologics limited  a subsidiary of merck co  inc we are currently in the process of manufacturing additional ecallantide drug substance that is expected to be released during the first quarter of our inventories would then be sufficient to supply all ongoing studies relating to ecallantide and kalbitor and to meet anticipated market demand into under existing arrangements with msd biologics  they have agreed to conduct additional manufacturing campaigns  as necessary  to supplement existing inventory 
the shelf life of our frozen ecallantide drug substance is four years 
ecallantide drug substance is filled  labeled and packaged into the final form of kalbitor drug product by hollister steir at its facilities in spokane  washington under a commercial supply agreement 
this process  known in the industry as the fill and finish process  is not unique to kalbitor and alternative manufacturers are readily available in the event that we elect  or are required  to relocate the fill and finish process 
kalbitor in its filled and finished form has additional refrigerated shelf life of three years 
ecallantide outside of the united states in markets outside of the united states  we intend to seek approval and commercialize ecallantide for hae and other angioedema indications in conjunction with multiple partners by entering into license or collaboration agreements with companies that have established distribution systems and direct sales forces in such territories 
in june  we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with sigma tau to develop and commercialize subcutaneous ecallantide for the treatment of hae and other therapeutic indications throughout europe  north africa  the middle east and russia 
we retained our rights to ecallantide in all other territories 
under the terms of the agreement  sigma tau made a million upfront payment to us and also purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which represented a premium over the day average closing price through june   for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we will also be eligible to receive over million in development and sales milestones related to ecallantide and royalties equal to of net sales of product 
sigma tau will pay the costs associated with regulatory approval and commercialization in the licensed territories 
in addition  we and sigma tau will share equally the costs for all development activities for future indications developed in partnership with sigma tau 
the marketing authorization application maa was submitted in may to the european medicines agency ema for ecallantide for the treatment of hae 
in july  the ema completed its validation process for the maa for potential approval to market ecallantide in the european union eu 
we are working with sigma tau on the response to the day consolidated list of questions from the ema 
these questions are within our expectations 
we anticipate an ema decision by year end we also anticipate that the maa will be transferred from us to sigma tau prior to any approval decision 
if approved  kalbitor will receive marketing authorization in eu member states 
in december  we amended our agreement with sigma tau to expand our collaboration to commercialize kalbitor for the treatment of hae in australia and new zealand 
under the terms of the amendment  in january  sigma tau made a  upfront payment to us and also purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which represented a premium over the day average closing price through december   for an aggregate purchase price of  we will also be eligible to receive up to million in regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties equal to of net sales of product  as adjusted for product costs 
consistent with the previous agreement  sigma tau will pay the costs associated with regulatory approval and commercialization in these additional territories 
in september  we entered in an agreement with cmic co  ltd cmic to develop and commercialize subcutaneous ecallantide for the treatment of hae and other angioedema indications in japan 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million upfront payment 
we will also be eligible to receive up to million in development and sales milestones for ecallantide in hae and other angioedema indications and royalties of of net product sales 
cmic is solely responsible for all costs associated with development  regulatory activities  and commercialization of ecallantide for all angioedema indications in japan 
cmic will purchase drug product from us on a cost plus basis for clinical and commercial supply 
in march  we entered into an agreement with neopharm scientific ltd  neopharm to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ecallantide for hae and other angioedema indications in israel 
under the terms of the agreement  we will provide neopharm drug supply at a price equal to of net sales 
ecallantide for treatment of other angioedemas in addition to its approved commercial use  we are also developing ecallantide in other angioedema indications 
another form of angioedema is induced by the use of so called ace inhibitors 
with an estimated million prescriptions written annually worldwide  ace inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce ace and generally reduce high blood pressure and vascular constriction 
it is estimated that up to of patients treated with ace inhibitors suffer from angioedema attacks  which represents approximately of all angioedemas treated in emergency rooms 
research suggests the use of ace inhibitors increases the relative activity of bradykinin  a protein that causes blood vessels to enlarge  or dilate  which can also cause the swelling known as angioedema 
as a specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein  an enzyme needed to produce bradykinin  ecallantide has the potential to be effective for treating this condition 
we filed an ind for a placebo controlled phase clinical study for this indication 
this application was filed with the fda in december we are in the process of establishing clinical trial sites and expect to treat the first patient during the first half of data from this trial are expected in the second half of ecallantide for ophthalmic indications we entered into a license agreement in with fovea pharmaceuticals sa  a subsidiary of sanofi aventis  for the development of ecallantide in the eu for treatment of retinal diseases 
under this agreement  fovea will fully fund development for the first indication  retinal vein occlusion induced macular edema  for which a phase trial was initiated in the third quarter of we retain all rights to commercialize ecallantide in this indication outside of the eu 
under the license agreement  we do not receive milestone payments  but are entitled to receive tiered royalties  ranging from the high teens to mid twenties  based on sales of ecallantide by fovea in the eu 
if we elect to commercialize ecallantide in this indication outside of the eu  fovea will be entitled to receive royalties from us  ranging from the low to mid teens  based on our sales of ecallantide outside the eu 
the term of the agreement continues until the expiration of the licensed patents or  if later  the eleventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of ecallantide in an ophthalmic indication 
the agreement may be terminated by fovea on prior notice to us and by either party for cause 
licensing and funded research program lfrp product development currently  product candidates generated by our licensees or collaborators under the lfrp portfolio are in clinical development  four of which are in phase  four are in phase and nine are in phase in addition  one product has received market approval from the fda 
furthermore  we estimate that our licensees and collaborators have over additional product candidates in various stages of research and preclinical development 
our licensees and collaborators are responsible for all costs associated with development of these product candidates 
we will receive milestones and royalties from our licensees and collaborators to the extent these product candidates advance in development and are ultimately commercialized 
generally  under the terms of our lfrp licenses  we are entitled to receive royalties on commercial salesof all products for at least ten years after initial commercialization 
to the extent that the product candidates in the chart above receive marketing approval and are commercialized according to published timelines  we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales beginning in furthermore  based upon our own analysis as to the probability of receiving marketing approval and the large markets being addressed  we expect potential annual royalty revenues under the lfrp of more than million by currently  the types of licenses and collaborations that we enter into have one of three distinct structures library licenses 
we believe our phage display libraries represent the gold standard for therapeutic development 
under our library license program  we grant our licensees rights to use our phage display libraries in connection with their internal therapeutic development programs 
we also provide these licensees with related materials and training so that they may rapidly identify compounds that bind with high affinity to therapeutic targets 
the period during which our licensees may use our libraries is typically limited to a to year term 
library license agreements contain significant up front license fees  annual maintenance fees  milestone payments based on successful product development  and royalties based on any future product sales 
we have approximately library licensees including amgen  aveo  bayer schering  biogen idec  boehringer ingelheim  csl  imclone systems a wholly owned subsidiary of eli lilly  merck serono  novo nordisk  sanofi aventis and trubion now known as emergent biosolutions 
funded research 
under our funded research program  we perform funded research for various collaborators using our phage display technology to identify  characterize and optimize antibodies that bind to disease targets provided by the collaborators 
our funded research collaborators with products currently in development include astrazeneca  baxter healthcare  biogen idec  merck serono  merrimack  and trubion now known as emergent biosolutions 
patent licenses 
under our patent license program  we grant other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies non exclusive licenses to use our core phage display patents known as the ladner patents  to discover and develop biologic compounds for use in specified fields 
we generally grant licenses on a non exclusive basis so that we may retain broad rights to practice our phage display technology in multiple fields 
our license agreements generally provide for up front license fees  annual maintenance fees  milestone payments based on successful product development  and royalties based on any future product sales for a period of ten years after commercialization of any resulting product 
in addition  under the terms of our license agreements  most licensees have agreed not to sue us for using phage display improvement patents which they developed and some have granted us specific access to certain phage display technologies which they have developed or which they control 
we believe that these provisions allow us to practice enhancements to phage display developed by our licensees 
we currently have approximately patent licensees worldwide 
once the ladner patents expire in  we will no longer be entering into additional patent license agreements 
we expect to continue to enter into licenses and collaborations that are designed to maximize the strategic value of our proprietary phage display technology 
dyax pipeline we are pursuing additional niche indications by leveraging our phage display technology expertise to identify new drug candidates 
we have several preclinical candidates in our internal pipeline generated from phage display technology 
our goal is to file a new investigational new drug application every months 
candidates are targeted which have defined regulatory pathways and address meaningful market opportunities 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues for were million  compared with million in and million in our financial guidance for total revenue in is to million  including kalbitor sales of to million 
in addition  our financial guidance for total revenue in is to million  including kalbitor sales of to million and lfrp revenue of to million 
product sales 
we began commercializing kalbitor in the united states for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older in february  at which time product sales commenced 
we sell kalbitor to absg  which functions as our exclusive distributor  and we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed to absg  typically upon delivery 
due to the specialty nature of kalbitor  the limited number of patients  limited return rights and contractual limits on inventory levels  we anticipate that absg will carry limited inventory 
we record product sales net of allowances and accruals related to trade prompt pay discounts  government rebates  a patient financial assistance program  product returns and other applicable allowances 
development and license fees 
we also derive revenues from licensing  funded research and development fees  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators in amounts that fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of the clinical activities of our collaborators and licensees 
this revenue was million in  million in and million in the revenue increase was due to million recognized from the sale of rights to royalties and other payments related to xyntha  a product developed by one of our licensees under the lfrp  and million of previously deferred revenue associated with the cubist license that was fully recognized during based upon cubist s termination of its ecallantide development program 
during  we recognized million of revenue associated with the cubist license 
the decrease in revenue from to was primarily due to million of revenue recognized in that was associated with our sanofi aventis license agreement 
under this exclusive worldwide license  sanofi aventis received rights for the development and commercialization of the fully human monoclonal antibody dx as a therapeutic product 
we recognized no revenue under this license in the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase of million in revenue from our license agreement with cubist  as well as an increase in patent and library license revenue  including milestones and royalties 
cost of product sales 
we incurred  of costs associated with product sales during this primarily includes the cost of testing  filling  packaging and distributing the product  as well as a royalty due on net sales of kalbitor 
costs associated with the manufacture of kalbitor prior to fda approval were previously expensed when incurred and accordingly are not included in the cost of product sales during the supply of kalbitor produced prior to fda approval is expected to meet anticipated commercial needs through early when this supply has been depleted  we expect our cost of product sales will increase  reflecting the full manufacturing cost of kalbitor 
research and development 
our research and development expenses are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands kalbitor development costs ecallantide drug substance manufacturing costs other research and development expenses total our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs for our personnel dedicated to research  development  medical and pharmacovigilence activities  as well as costs of post approval studies and commitments and kalbitor life cycle management  as well as fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research and clinical trials and the cost of manufacturing drug material prior to fda approval 
in addition  our development expenses include million of costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the treatment of hae in europe which are being reimbursed by sigma tau 
the cost decrease in the period is primarily due to an million decrease in ecallantide drug manufacturing costs and million in lower personnel expenses resulting from our workforce reduction in the the decrease in the research and development expenses as compared to the period  is primarily due to cost savings related to the workforce reduction in and closure of the liege  belgium research facility in  as well as a million decrease in clinical costs after our edema phase trial which was completed in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in costs to manufacture kalbitor drug substance during research and development expenses may increase in future years primarily due to clinical trial costs associated with our exploration of using kalbitor for treatment of drug induced angioedema 
we plan to initiate a phase clinical study during until the phase clinical study is completed  we are not able to predict the future clinical costs that may be incurred for this indication 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the sales and marketing costs of commercializing kalbitor in and  costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees and the reporting requirements of a public company 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in costs is primarily due to additional infrastructure to support the commercial launch of kalbitor  including the expansion of sales and marketing personnel 
these costs include increases of million in internal sales and marketing expenses and million in external sales and marketing expenses 
the higher general and administrative costs in compared to were primarily due to an increase in infrastructure to support plans for commercialization of kalbitor and a charge of million for share based compensation expense for amendments to the exercise and vesting schedules of certain options in restructuring and impairment 
in  we implemented a workforce reduction to focus necessary resources on the commercialization of ecallantide and to support our long term financial success 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
due to the decrease in necessary facility space following the workforce reduction  we amended our facility lease  resulting in a charge of approximately  for the write down of leasehold improvements 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to the full pay off of our debt with paul royalty 
interest expense 
interest expense in was million compared to million in and million in the increase is due to additional interest expense under the cowen healthcare loan  consisting of approximately million for payments to cowen healthcare in connection with the sale of our rights to royalties and other payments related to the xyntha product  and interest on the million tranche b loan which was received in march the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest on the million tranche b loan from cowen healthcare 
interest and other income 
interest income was   and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income from to was due to lower rates of return on our investments 
the decrease from to was due to lower investment balances and lower interest rates on our investments 
in  income of million was recognized for several grants received under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
under this program  the internal revenue service  in conjunction with the department of health and human services  approved our applications for projects that showed significant potential to produce new and cost saving therapies  support jobs and increase us competitiveness 
all proceeds from this grant were classified as other income in the statement of operations 
in  we received an  grant from the walloon region of belgium  which included specific criteria regarding employment and investment levels that needed to be met 
in connection with the closure of our liege  belgium facility in  we refunded approximately  of the grant 
in  all remaining investment criteria were met and the residual grant balance of approximately million was released from short term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as other income in the statement of operations 
net loss 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million or per share  as compared to million or per share in  and million or per share in liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash flow activity years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign currency translation on cash balances net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we require cash to fund our operating activities  make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and service debt 
through december   we have funded our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million 
we have also borrowed funds under our loan agreement with cowen healthcare  which are secured by certain assets associated with our lfrp 
in addition  we generate funds from product sales and development and license fees 
our excess funds are currently invested in short term investments primarily consisting of united states treasury notes and bills and money market funds backed by the united states treasury 
our financial guidance is that we expect to be at cash flow breakeven during operating activities 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our net loss which was million 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had a net change in other operating assets and liabilities of million  including a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
the change in deferred revenue is primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue associated with the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with cubist in  offset by additional deferred revenue of million from collaborations to commercialize ecallantide outside the united states 
during october  a new drug substance manufacturing campaign was initiated with msd biologics to meet the demand for kalbitor and supply clinical programs  as needed 
costs under this manufacturing campaign are expected to approximate million and will be paid in in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our net loss which was million 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million  interest expense of million  non cash income of million primarily due to the recognition of million in income related to the walloon grant  impairment of fixed assets totaling million  and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had a net change in other operating assets and liabilities which used cash of  including decreases in deferred revenue of million and accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and deferred rent of  these were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in cash used for operating activities in compared to was million  primarily due to revenue deferred in and the debt extinguishment cost in in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our net loss which was million 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million  interest expense of million and stock based compensation expense of million  and certain revenues  for which we received payment totaling million  were deferred for financial reporting purposes in in addition  when we repaid the paul royalty loan  million was recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt and that cash payment is reflected in financing activities 
investing activities 
our investing activities for consisted of the purchase of securities totaling approximately million  offset by investment maturities of million  as well as a decrease of  in restricted cash from the contractual reduction of the letter of credit that serves as our security deposit for the lease of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
our investing activities for consisted of investment maturities totaling approximately million  offset by purchases of additional securities of million and the purchase of approximately  of fixed assets 
our investing activities for primarily consisted of the timing of the maturity and purchase of our short term investments and a million decrease in restricted cash from a contractual reduction of our letter of credit that serves as our security deposit for the lease of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
in addition  we purchased fixed assets totaling million 
financing activities 
our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock  as well as principal repayments of long term debt totaling million  consisting of capital lease payments and million to cowen healthcare 
our financing activities for consisted of equity offerings providing net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of million from the tranche b loan with cowen healthcare  which was an amendment to our existing loan agreement with cowen healthcare 
this tranche b loan is secured by our lfrp on the same terms as the initial tranche a loan  which was executed in we also repaid long term obligations  totaling million  primarily principal payments to cowen healthcare on these loans 
our financing activities for primarily consist of net proceeds of million from our note payable to cowen healthcare  a million private sale of common stock  proceeds from long term obligations of million and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
we also repaid the paul royalty loan for million and other long term obligations of million 
we have financed fixed asset purchases through capital leases and debt 
capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets under lease 
we expect to continue to manage our cash requirements by completing additional partnerships  collaborations  and financial and strategic transactions 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments together with anticipated cash flow from existing development  collaborations and license agreements and product sales of kalbitor will be sufficient to support our current operations through we will need additional funds if our cash requirements exceed our current expectations or if we generate less revenue than we expect during this period 
we may seek additional funding through some combination of our collaborative arrangements and public or private equity or debt financings 
we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  and we may not be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
if we need additional funds and are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we might need to curtail significantly our research  development or commercialization programs in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue operations  which could adversely affect our business prospects 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years more than years in thousands note payable capital leases leasehold improvement arrangements operating lease obligations patent and product license obligations obligations for research  development and manufacturing total contractual obligations these amounts represent projected future principal and interest payments to cowen healthcare based on our current lfrp projections  which are subject to uncertainties based on the timing and amounts of cash receipts under the lfrp
