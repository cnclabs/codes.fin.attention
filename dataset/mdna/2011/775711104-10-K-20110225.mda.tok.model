table of contents results of operations versus overview for the year ended december   the company had net income of million compared to million in  a increase 
the company achieved a increase in revenue  with all business lines contributing to the growth

additionally  the company was effective in controlling cost as gross margin improved percentage points to for versus for sales  general and administrative expense also showed a small improvement  was of revenue versus in while there was a small deterioration in depreciation margin in versus in  it is a result of our investments in acquisitions  most notably hometeam and crane 
during we were able to direct our business so that the weak economy did not have a serious impact 
the company business model provides for strength from recurring revenues and a diverse customer base  in  our largest twenty customers were less than of our total revenues

cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december  cost of services provided increased million or  compared to the twelve months ended december  gross margins year to date increased to for versus for margins improved basis points due to lower cost of fuel and a basis point improvement in productivity 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in material and supply costs driven by change in sales mix  as commercial  fumigation and termite control have higher material and supply costs than residential pest control 
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million  an increase of compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase is due to million in depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition of hometeam on april  and the crane pest control acquisition of december  
table of contents sales  general and administrative for the twelve months ended december   sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or compared to the twelve months ended december  representing of revenues compared to of revenues in the prior year period 
the increase in total dollars and expense margin primarily reflects having a full year of hometeam expenses in and only nine months in along with a full year of crane that was acquired december  savings in lower fuel costs were offset by increase in sales costs as we expanded our sales team 
interest income expense  net interest income expense for the year ended december  was a million expense  an increase of million compared to interest expense of million in due to average debt outstanding over the full year being greater than the prior year and a reduction of cash on hand

table of contents fiscal in the opinion of management  additional plan contributions will not have a material effect on the company financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company used million on investments for the year ended december  and invested approximately million in capital expenditures during the year 
capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of equipment replacements and technology related projects 
the company expects to invest between million and million in in capital expenditures 
during  the company acquired waltham services and several smaller companies totaling million compared to million in acquisitions during and million in the expenditures for the company acquisitions were primarily funded by cash on hand and borrowings under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the company continues to seek new acquisitions

on march   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america  na for an unsecured line of credit of up to million  which includes a million letter of credit subfacility  and a million swingline subfacility 
as of december   borrowings of million were outstanding under the line of credit and million under the swingline subfacility 
the company maintains approximately million in letters of credit 
these letters of credit are required by the company fronting insurance companies and or certain states  due to the company self insured status  to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage 
the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets  funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims 
the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by rollins domestic subsidiaries 
the maturity date of the credit agreement is march  outstanding balances of individual tranches under the credit agreement currently mature in the first quarter of revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates  at the company election the base rate  which is the highest of suntrust bank prime rate for the day of the borrowing  a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libor rate determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one month  or with respect to any eurodollar borrowings  adjusted libor which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the us federal reserve plus an additional amount  which varies between

the revolving credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions  including  without limitation  certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the company ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens  or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity 
further  the revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants restricting the company ability to permit the ratio of the company consolidated debt to ebitda to exceed certain limits 
the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december  and expects to maintain compliance throughout litigation for discussion on the company legal contingencies  see note to the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows  the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
the impact that the company contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years line of credit business combination related liabilities non cancelable operating leases unrecognized tax positions total the company estimates interest on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit to be less than million for the period of less than one year 
these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  uncertain tax positions of million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement 
minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required 
the company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately million 
critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows subsequent events the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued 
as of  the filing date  february   there were no subsequent events that would affect its financial statements 
accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs and associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services 
factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company business practices 
however  it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims 
positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts  more effective treatment methods  more effective termiticides  and expanding training 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management 
table of contents knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data  actual developments may vary from the company projections 
this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment 
therefore  changes in estimates may be material 
management judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly  bi monthly or quarterly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services 
the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service 
fair values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the company 
the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
revenue received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  and  the cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred 
for outstanding claims  an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information 
the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and  while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts  these costs are incurred over the contract term 
as the revenue is being deferred  the future cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred 
the company accrues for noticed claims 
the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codificationtm asc topic contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation  
table of contents judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company financial condition or results of operations 
defined benefit pension plans in  the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins  inc defined benefit plan  although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march the company has other smaller pension plans acquired related to acquisitions included in note to the company financial statements 
the company accounts for these defined benefit plan in accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs 
with the assistance of the actuary  the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets  the discount rate  and other factors  and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes  the investments strategy  and the views of our investment adviser 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
the company assumption for the expected return on plan assets is seven percent which is unchanged from the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company utilizes a yield curve approach 
the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year 
the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds 
the discount rate was percent as of december  compared to percent in and percent in a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 
as set forth in note to the company financial statements  included among the asset categories for the plan investments are real estate  tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds 
these investments are categorized as level investments and are valued using significant non observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value 
in accordance with asu no 
investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested 
these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect  resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments 
the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 
as of december   the defined benefit plans were under funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by million before tax 
new accounting standards recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements that include multiple revenue generating activities  and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in asu

the guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers and information on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under level of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  the company adopted the amendments for levels and in the first quarter of and the adoption did not have a material impact on the disclosures of in the company consolidated financial statements

if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liabilities would generally be recognized in accordance with asc contingencies  if the criteria for disclosures under that topic are met 
the disclosures are required for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted these amendments in the first quarter of the adoption did not have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements
