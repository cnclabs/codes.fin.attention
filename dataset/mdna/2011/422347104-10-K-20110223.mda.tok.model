overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier with corporate headquarters in north liberty  iowa and operating office and shop combined regional terminal locations in nine states and two shop only locations outside of iowa 
the company provides regional dry van truckload services through its regional terminals plus its corporate headquarters 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
the company s elev en regional operating divisions  not including operations at the corporate headquarters  accounted for   and of the  and operating revenues  respectively 
the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the keys to maintaining a high level of service are the availability of late model equipment and experienced drivers 
operating efficiencies and cost controls are achieved through equipment utilizat ion  operating a fleet of late model equipment  maintaining an industry leading driver to non driver employee ratio  and the effective management of fixed and variable operating costs 
the industry experienced soft freight demand in  which worsened throughout creating downward pressures on freight rates and fuel surcharge rates throughout and into early during industry capacity tightened although current freight volumes are still below volumes experienced prior to the recent recession 
the tightening capacity in the industry with an increase in freight volumes  compared to  allowed for stabilization and certain improvements in freight rates during which management expects to continue into as fuel prices soared to historical highs during  containment of fuel cost became a top priority of management 
the company continued to address fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs during and these initiatives included 
table of contents strategic fueling of our trucks whether it be terminal fuel or over the road fuel  reduction of tractor idle time  controlling out of route miles  increased fuel economy through new tractors acquired in through  and to a lesser extent fuel hedging 
these initiatives proved beneficial during the us average price of diesel fuel increased from approximately per gallon to approximately per gallon and the company miles increased in compared to  however fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenues  only increased 
at december   the company s tractor fleet had an average age of years while the trailer fl eet had an average age of years 
the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company s regional operating areas 
in addition to the development of its regional operating centers  the company has made five acquisitions since we believe our commitment to quality service allowed the company to hold its freight rates relatively stable throughout  during the most recent recession  in comparison to our competitors  better positioning the company for future growth

the company increased the retention limits for auto liability claims from million to million for each claim occurring on or after april  in an effort to offset raises in insurance premium costs 
depreciation increased million  to million during from million in the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in tractor purchases during and and as part of the company s latest fleet upgrade program 
as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase 
the majority of the latest tractor fleet upgrade took place throughout therefore  depreciation expense during did not reflect a full first year of depreciation on newly acquired tractors 
tractors purchased subsequent to january  are being depreciated using the declining balance method 
tractors purchased prior to january  are depreciated using the declining balance method 
the change was the result of the cost of new tractors  current tractor trade values and the expected values in the used equipment market

the change in all other depreciation was not significant 
operating and maintenance expense increased million  to million during from million in operating and maintenance costs increased due to higher freight volumes when comparing the two periods as well as costs to prepare tractors for trades and certain updates to older trailers within the company fleet 
the company also experienced increases in over the road repairs mainly due to heightened awareness of maintenance issues under csa compliance guidelines 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during from million in the gain decrease was the net effect of a decrease in gains on trades and sales of tractor equipment of million offset by an increase in gains on trailer equipment sales of million and other sales of million 
the decrease in gains on tractors was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of units traded or sold in compared to the increase in gains on trailer sales was due to the company not selling any trailers during interest income decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease is mainly the result of lower average returns due to the decline in interest rates applicable to short and long term investments which persisted throughout the decrease in the company overall return was largely attributable to a larger mix of cash and cash equivalents tied to short term interest rates from long term auction rate security investments due to a signi ficant amount of calls received during the company s effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to a decrease in a favorable income tax expense adjustments during compared to the same period of resulting from the roll off of certain state tax contingencies

other revenues decreased million as these other fees are directly associated with loads and miles driven 
fewer miles during resulted from a combination of less demand for shipping services as shippers were shipping lower quantities of goods during based on overall economic conditions  continued overcapacity within the industry  and significant pricing pressure within the industry

company driver wages decrease was consistent with the decrease in line haul revenues detailed above due to freight volume declines in compared to with a slight decrease in total company mileage rates paid due to a slight decrease in mileage rates paid to new drivers hired subsequent to may office and shop personnel wages decreased primarily as a result of fewer non driver personnel during compared to workers compensation expense decreased million due to an overall decrease in frequency and severity of claims incurred 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of of the total decrease  million related to a decrease in amounts paid to independent contractors and in other rental charges 
the decrease in amounts paid to independent contractors is attributable to fewer miles driven m illion and a decrease in amounts paid under the company fuel stability program due to lower average fuel costs during compared to million 
fuel decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the decrease is the net result of decreased fuel prices million and a decrease in miles driven and idle reduction initiatives million

depreciation increased million  to million during from million in the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in tractor purchases during the third and fourth quarters of and as part of the company latest fleet upgrade program 
as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase 
tractors purchased prior to january  are depreciated using the declining balance method 
tractors purchased subsequent to january  are being depreciated using the declining balance method  which increased tractor depreciation million during when compared to the depreciation method used in the prior year 
the change was the result of the cost of new tractors  current tractor trade values and the expected values in the trade market for the foreseeable future 
during the second half of and the company has placed in service  new tractors which have a higher base cost than previous tractors purchased approximately and are in the first year of depreciation 
tractor depreciation increased million to million in from million the increase in tractor depreciation was offset by a decrease of million in trailer depreciation in compared to the decrease in trailer depreciation was the direct result of a portion of our trailer fleet being depreciated to the estimated salvage value and accordingly th ere is not any further depreciation expense on these respective trailers 
all other depreciation increased million 
other operating expenses decreased million  to million during from million in other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs which have decreased mainly due to lower load counts  driver miles and less driver recruiting 
gain on the disposal of pro perty and equipment increased million  to million during from million in the gain increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the number of tractors traded or sold during the period 
table of contents compared to the period 
interest income decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease is mainly the result of lower average returns due to the decline in interest rates applicable to short and long term investments which the company saw throughout  and continued declines into as well as lower average balances of cash and investments due to uses of cash for investing and finance purposes 
the company effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increased favorable income tax expense adjustment during compared to the same period of as a result of the roll off of certain state tax contingencies due to the application of the authoritative guidance on uncertain income tax positions coupled with less taxable income during the current year compared to the same period of along with additional state income tax benefits recorded in from certain state tax return filing positions 
as a result of the foregoing  the company operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with durin g the year ended december  net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  inflation has been fairly modest with its impacts mostly related to revenue equipment p rices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology  epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufactured after january  and january   and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
during the fleet upgrade in and  the company experienced an average increase in tractor prices of associated with the latest engine emission requirements  when compared to tractor prices associated with the last fleet upgrade with pre january tractor engines 
beginning in mid the company began to experience increases in freight rates in certain markets but over the most recent three year period  increases in freight rates have been minimal compared to the percentage increase in the price of newer tractors 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
during average fuel prices fluctuated between per gallon and per gallon with significant increases in relatively short periods of time 
during and changes in average fuel prices were more modest  fluctuating between per gallon and per gallon with increases covering a longer period of time 
as a result  for the years ended december    and  fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue and fuel stabilization paid to independent contractors along with favorable fuel hedge settlements  was   and  respectively  of the company s total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue 
nbsp  significant fluctuations in fuel prices increase our cost of operations as the company is unable to pass through all increases in fuel prices 
the company is not able to recover fuel surcharge on empty miles or fuel used in idling so as there are significant changes in fuel prices the company operating results could be adversely effected 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  fund ing revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations  which was the case during and with the purchase of  new tractors and new trailers 
during an additional tractors and new trailers were purchased and funded with cash flows from operations 
the total estimated net purchase commitments at december  for new tractors and trailers  net of guaranteed minimum trade values  is currently estimated at million 
although the company expects to sell trailers during to provide additional sources of cash flows for new trailers  there were no guaranteed commitments from third parties to buy trailers during the company ended with c ash and cash equivalents of million 
the company s primary source of liquidity for was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in this was primarily a result of net income excluding non cash depr eciation  changes in deferred taxes  and gains on disposal of equipment being approximately million lower in compared to offset by an increase in cash flow generated by operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the net increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for compared to the same period of was mainly attributable to a reduction in accrued in come taxes offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased freight volumes 
cash flow from operating activities was of operating revenues in compared with in 
table of contents cash flows from investing increased million for compared to the same period of due to net cash inflows of million during compared to cash outflows of million during the increase of investing cash flows was mainly the result of a decline in capital expenditures of million  an increase in cash provided by sales of revenue equipment of million and increased cash received from investment maturities and calls  net of investment purchases  of million 
cash received from sales of equipment exceeded cash expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  by million during compared to cash outflows for equipment purchases of million in related to revenue equipment investments 
the company currently anticipates capital expenditures on revenue equipment to be approximately million in  net of guaranteed residual values on tractors expected to be sold during although the company expects to sell trailers during to provide additional sources of cash flows for new trailers that would directly reduce the commitment amount  there were no guaranteed commitments from third parties to buy trailers during the company received million in cash during related to partial calls of tax free  auction rate student loan educational bonds ars compared to million receipts from ars calls during the company received an additional million from ars partial calls subsequent to december  which are reflected as short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company paid million in dividends during compared to cash dividends of million paid dividends paid during included a special dividend of paid in october there were no special dividend payments in the dividends declared in the fourth quarter of and were paid i n the fourth quarter of and  respectively  and there were no outstanding dividends in accounts payable as of december  and in september  the board of directors of the company authorized a program to repurchase million shares  adjusted for stock splits  of the company s common stock in open market or n egotiated transactions using available cash  cash equivalents and investments 
in and respectively  million and million shares were repurchased in the open market and retired for million and million respectively 
there were no shares repurchased during the authorization to repurchase remains open at december  and has no expiration date 
the r epurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
approximately million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program 
the company paid income taxes  net of refunds  of million in which was million higher than income taxes paid during the same period in of million 
the increase is mainly driven by higher estimated federal income tax payments based on higher expected taxable income for the year ending december  combined with income tax payments during being lower due to bonus depreciation deductions on significant revenue equipment purchases during compared to management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
management believes the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded from cash flows provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the company s balance sheet remains debt free 
the company ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  an increase of million from december  all of the company s short term and long term investment balances at december  and primarily all of the short term and long term investment balances at december  were invested in ars that are classified as available for sale 
the investments typically have an interest reset provision of days with contractual maturities that range from to years as of december  at the reset date  the company has the option to roll the investments and reset the interest rate or sell the investments in an auction 
the company receives the par value of the investment plus accrued interest on the reset date if the underlying investment is sold 
as of december   of ars holdings  at par  were backed by the us government and held aaa or equivalent ratings from recognized rating agencies 
as of december   all of the company s auction rate student loan bonds were associated with unsuccessful auctions 
as such  the estimated fair value of the underlying investments had declined below amortized cost of the investments as a result of liquidity issues in the auction rate markets 
to date  there have been no instances of delinquencies or non paymen t of applicable interest from the issuers and all partial calls of securities by the issuers have been at par value plus accrued interest 
since the first auction failures in february when the company had approximately million ars at par  the company has received approximately million of calls from issuers  at par  plus accrued interest at the time of the call 
this includes million received in january which has been classified as short term investments as of december  accrued interest income is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
th e company estimates the fair value of the auction rate securities applying the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes fair value as an estimate of what the company could sell the investments for in an orderly transaction with a third party as of each measurement date 
it is not the intent of the company to sell such securities at discounted pricing 
the 
table of contents authoritative guidance established a three level fair value hierarchy with level investments deriving fair value from quoted prices in active markets and level investments deriving fair value from model based techniques that use significant inputs and assumptions not observable to market participants 
until auction failures began  the fair value of these investments were calculated using level observable inputs and fair value was deemed to be equivalent to amortized cost due to the short term and regularly occurring auction process 
based on auction failures beginning in mid february and continued failures through december   there were no significant observable quoted prices or other relevant inputs for identical or similar securities 
the fair value of these investments as of the december  and measurement dates could not be determined with precision based on lack of observable market data and could significantly change in future measurement periods 
the company performs an internal cash flow analysis on an individual investment basis to estimate fair value of ars using inputs determined based o n management consideration of its own internal considerations as well as information derived from other publicly available third party sources 
this approach considers the anticipated estimated outstanding average life of the underlying student loans range of one month for announced calls to twelve years that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns over the average life of the underlying student loans using forward rate curves  and payout formulas 
the range of estimated outstanding lives is based on call notices received by the company  communications with trusts  and communications with third party financial institutions 
these underlying cash flows  by individual investment  were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration adjusted for a lack of liquidity in the market 
the company also obtains estimated fair value of ars from third party financial advisors 
the company obtains an underst anding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value 
all of this information is considered when determining the estimated fair value of these instruments as recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company discounted cash flow approach requires the use of multiple input factors including an estimated rate of return  base discount rate  and a liquidity discount rate to reflect the current lack of liquidity of ars in capital markets due to auction failures 
we understand that models employed by the company third party financial advisors are also subject to changes in similar input factors 
as such  the estimated fair value of ars is subject to change based on significant changes to the underlying input factors 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of a basis point change to the rate of return  discount rate  and liquidity discount rate noting that this would not materially impact the recorded fair value 
the table below shows the inputs in the company cash flow models as of december  for the remaining ars investments compared to the inputs used in cash flow models as of december  inputs used in company models of all securities held as of december  and december  excluding investments whose fair value is estimated to be par value as of the reporting period due to call notices being received by the company were as follows december  december  average life of underlying loans years years rat e of return discount rate liquidity discount rate the unrealized loss of million is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and the company has not recognized any other than temporary impairments in the consolidated statements of income 
there were not any realized gains or losses related to these investments for the years ended december    and off balance sheet transactions the company s liquidity or financial condition is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  
table of contents payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligation obligations for unrecognized tax benefits obligations for unrecognized tax benefits represent potential liabilities and include interest and penalties 
the company is unable to reasonably determine when these amounts will be settled 
at december  and  the company had a total of million and million in gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
of this amount  million and million represe nts the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate as of december  and unrecognized tax benefits were a net decrease of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  due mainly to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation net of additions 
the total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was million and million at december  and and is included in income taxes payable 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income tax filing positions for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
these changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations  examinations or other unforeseen circumstances 
as of december   the company did not have any ongoing examinations or outstanding litigation related to tax matters 
at this time  management s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits to be a decrease of approximately to million during the next twelve months mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for the years and forward 
tax years and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on the tax code and administrative practice of each state 
as of december  the company did not have any significant operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations or outstanding long term debt obligations 
the company has entered into commitments to further upgrade the company existing tractor and trailer fleets 
delivery of tractor equipment began in the third quarter of and is currently scheduled to continue into the second quarter of in addition  the company has purchase commitments outstanding for deliveries of trailer equipment throughout the total estimated net purchase commitments  net of guaranteed minimum trade values  at december  is currently estimated at million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue and cost recognition revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
revenue associated with loads delivered but not billed as of the end of an accounting period are estimated as part of revenue for that period 
driver wages and other direct operating expenses are recognized when freight is delivered and are estimated for loads in process at the end of an accounting period 
property  plant and equipment management estimates the useful lives of revenue equipment based on estimated use of the asset 
for tractors  it has been the historical practice of the company to buy tractor and trailer equipment new directly from manufacturers 
depreciable lives of 
table of contents tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
management estimates the useful lives on tractors based on average miles per truck per year as well as manufacturer warranty periods 
the company has not historically run tractors outside of manufacturer warranty periods 
management estimates the useful lives of trailers based on manufacturer warranty periods as well as the company internal maintenance programs 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
a key component to expected market values of equipment is the company historical maintenance programs which in management opinion is critical to the resale value of equipment 
management selects depreciation methods that it believes most accurately reflects the timing of benefit received from the applicable assets 
tractors are depreci ated using the declining balance method for tractors acquired before january  and for tractors acquired after january  as management believes this is the best matching of depreciation expense with the decline in estimated tractor value based on use of the tractor 
self insurance accruals management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
industry development as well as the company historical case results are used to determine development of individual case claims 
income taxes significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
recent tax law changes have not significantly effected the company expectation of tax rates 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
the company has recorded a million valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets associated with the unrealized loss due to auction rate securities fair value adjustments 
this valuation allowance was recorded as the company does not have historical capital gains nor does it expect to generate capital gains sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by the fair value adjustments 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets as it is management opinion that it is more likely than not the company will be able to utilize the remaining deferred tax assets based on the company history of profitability and taxable income 
management judgment is required in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements based on recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income filing positions and not federal income tax filing positions 
measurement of uncertain income tax positions is based on statutes of limitations  penalty rates  and interest rates on a state by state and year by year basis 
auction rate securities auction rate security investments are valued at fair value applying a fair value hierarchy as established by applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as there is no current active market for these securities  management utilizes a combination of internal discounted cash flow models with key inputs and assumptions being the discount rate  rate of return and duration as well as external market data provided by financial institutions 
management does not consider there to be significant credit risk due to government support of the underlying loans and current credit ratings 
management monitors its investments and ongoing market conditions to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair values continue to remain below cost or the fair value decrease significantly from current fair value due to credit related issues  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments  through a charge in the consolidated statement of income 
to date  the company has not recorded any impairment of these investments in the consolidated statement of income 
the company performs an internal cash flow analysis on an individual investment basis to estimate fair value of ars using inputs determined based on management own internal considerations as well as information derived from other publicly available third party sources 
this approach considers the a nticipated estimated outstanding average life of the underlying student loans range of one month for announced calls to twelve years that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns over the average life of the underlying student loans using forward rate curves  and payout formulas 
the range of estimated outstanding lives is based on call notices received by the company  communications with trusts  and communications with third party financial institutions 
these underlying cash flows  by individual investment  were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration adjusted for a lack of liquidity in the market 
the company also obtains estimated fair value of ars from third party financial advisors 
the company obtains an understanding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value 
all of this information is considered when determining the estimated fair v alue of these instruments as recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company discounted cash flow approach 
table of contents requires the use of multiple input factors including an estimated rate of return  base discount rate  a nd a liquidity discount rate to reflect the current lack of liquidity of ars in capital markets due to auction failures 
we understand that models employed by the company third party financial advisors are also subject to changes in similar input factors 
as such  the estimated fair value of ars is subject to change based on significant changes to the underlying input factors 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of a basis point change to the rate of return  discount rate  and liquidity discount rate noting that this would not materially impact the recorded fair value 
the table below shows the input factors in the company cash flow models as of december nbsp  and for the ars investments held on those dates 
in both instances  this excludes insurance backed investment or investments with less than aaa credit rating for purposes of comparison 
these two groups are insignificant at both december  and inputs used in company models of all securities held as of december  and december  excluding investments whose fa ir value is estimated to be par value as of the reporting period due to call notices being received by the company december  december  average life of underlying loans years years rate of return discount rate liquidity discount rate the unrealized loss of million is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and the company has not recognized any other than temporary impairments in the cons olidated statements of income 
there were not any realized gains or losses related to these investments for the years ended december  and new accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financi al statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our investments and from changes in commodity prices 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk 
the company s investments are primarily in the form of tax free  auction rate student loan educational bonds backed by the us government 
the investments typically have an interest reset provision of days with contractual maturities that range from to years as of december  at the reset date  the company has the option to roll the investments and reset the interest rate or sell the investments in an auction 
the company receives the par value of the investment plus accrued interest on the reset date if the underlying investment is sold 
as of december   approximately of the underlyin g investments of the total portfolio held aaa or equivalent ratings from recognized rating agencies 
there is no guarantee that when the company elects to participate in an auction and therefore sell investments  that a willing buyer will purchase the security and therefore there is no guarantee that the company will receive cash upon the election to sell 
the company experienced unsuccessful auctions beginning in february and continuing through december  as discussed in the footnotes to the financials and elsewhere in this report 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rate of the underlying investment is reset to a default maximum interest rate as stated in the prospectus of the underlying security which is typically a multiplier of current market interest rates 
until a subsequent auction is successful or the underlying security is called by the issuer  the company will be required to hold the underlying investment until contractual maturity 
the company only holds senior positions of underlying securities 
the company does not invest in any other asset backed securities and does not have direct securitized subprime mortgage loans exposure or loans to  commitments in  or investments in subprime lenders 
should the company have a need to liquidate any of these investments  the company may be required to discount these securities for liquidity but the company currently does not have this liquidity requirement 
based on historical and current operating cash flows  the company does not currently anticipate a requirement to liquidate underlying investments at discounted prices 
if the investments are downgraded in the credit ratings or the company witnesses other indicators of issues with collection  the company may be required to recognize an impairment other than the temporary impairment already recognized on these securities and record a charge in the statement of income 
assuming the company maintains short term and long term investment balances consistent with balances as of december   million amortized cost  and if market rates of interest on our investments decreased by basis points  the estimated reduction in annual interest income would be approximately million 
interest rate risk the company has no debt outstanding as of december  and therefore  has no market risk related to debt 
management believes that an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
we believe that the majority of the fuel price increases are generally passed to our customers
