readers are also urged to carefully review and consider our discussions regarding the various factors that affect our business  which are described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
overview on september   we entered into and consummated a series of agreements that resulted in the acquisition of all of the ordinary shares of deer international  a corporation organized under the laws of the british virgin islands on december   parent of its wholly owned subsidiary winder since march   and delta  a wholly owned subsidiary of winder 
winder and delta were incorporated in the guangdong province of the people s republic of china prc on july   and february   respectively 
pursuant to the share exchange agreement  we acquired from deer international  ordinary shares  consisting of all of its issued and outstanding capital stock for  shares of our common stock 
concurrently with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the share exchange agreement and as a condition thereof  we entered into an agreement with crescent liu  our former director and chief executive officer  pursuant to which he returned  shares of our common stock for cancellation 
mr 
liu was not compensated for the cancellation of his shares of our common stock 
upon completion of the foregoing transactions  we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
in connection with the above transaction  we changed our name to deer consumer products  inc on september  the exchange of shares with deer international was recorded as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting because deer international obtained control of our company 
accordingly  the merger of deer international into us was recorded as a recapitalization of deer international  with deer international being treated as the continuing entity 
the historical financial statements presented are the consolidated financial statements of deer international 
the share exchange agreement has been treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination  therefore  no pro forma information is disclosed 
at the date of this transaction  the net liabilities of the legal acquirer were we are engaged in the manufacture  marketing  distribution and sale of small home and kitchen electric appliances 
we develop  promote  manufacture and sell a broad range of stylish  safe and easy to use products including blenders  juicers and soy milk makers that are designed to make today s lifestyles simpler and healthier 
we manufacture our products in yangjiang  china and have corporate functions in nanshan  shenzhen  china 
we operate through our two wholly owned subsidiaries  winder  which is a wofe and responsible for research  production and delivery of goods  and delta  which transferred its material former operations to winder 
we have traditionally acted as both an odm and oem for the export market 
on april   we incorporated deer technology and anlin technology in anhui province 
we invested million in deer technology and million in anlin technology 
deer technology and anlin technology are engaged in the manufacture and sale of household electric appliances and were formed for the purpose of establishing a new factory located in the wuhu area of anhui province 
in deer technology paid approximately million and anlin technology paid approximately million to secure land use rights in anhui province 

table of contents we will continue to target the china domestic market by expanding our production and manufacturing facilities by building a new factory in the wuhu area of central china 
wuhu is located on the banks of the yangtze river within hours from shanghai and nanjing  which are some of china s most populous and economically developed regions 
this central location will improve our ability to deliver our products to customers located throughout china 
the new factory  which will increase our production capacity by  and distribution center will allow us to target the neighboring population of more than million as we continue to grow our business in the china domestic market 
we anticipate that the new factory will be completed in critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our results of operations  financial position and in liquidity 
we believe the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
areas that require estimates and assumptions include valuation of accounts receivable and inventory  determination of useful lives of property and equipment  estimation of certain liabilities and sales returns 
accounts receivable 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
advances to suppliers 
we make advances to certain vendors for purchase of its material 
the advances to suppliers are interest free and unsecured 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
we compare the cost of inventories with their market value and allowance is made to write down inventories to their market value  if lower 
long lived assets 
we periodically assess potential impairments to our long lived assets 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
factors we considered include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  based on the fair market value if available  or discounted cash flows 
to date  there has been no impairment of long lived assets 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred  additions  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
when property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is included in operations 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows buildings years equipment years vehicles years office equipment years revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when no other significant obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue 

table of contents foreign currency transactions and comprehensive income 
us gaap generally requires recognized revenue  expenses  gains and losses to be included in net income 
certain statements  however  require entities to report specific changes in assets and liabilities  such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation  as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet 
such items  along with net income  are components of comprehensive income 
our functional currency is the chinese renminbi 
the unit of renminbi is in yuan 
translation gains are classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
other comprehensive income in the statements of income and other comprehensive income includes translation gains recognized each period 
currency hedging 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange agreements with the bank of china  whereby we agree to sell us dollars to the bank of china at certain rates 
at december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu no

 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu no 

asu no 
re defines authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities to be only comprised of the fasb accounting standards codification codification and  for sec registrants  guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is a reorganization and compilation of all then existing authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities  except for guidance issued by the sec

on february   the fasb issued asu no 
subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  effective immediately 
the amendments in the asu remove the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of us gaap 
the fasb believes these amendments remove potential conflicts with the sec s literature 
the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on march   the fasb issued asu no 
derivatives and hedging topic scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives 
this asu clarifies the guidance within the derivative literature that exempts certain credit related features from analysis as potential embedded derivatives requiring separate accounting 
the asu specifies that an embedded credit derivative feature related to the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is not subject to bifurcation from a host contract under asc  derivatives and hedging embedded derivatives recognition 
all other embedded credit derivative features should be analyzed to determine whether their economic characteristics and risks are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and whether bifurcation is required 
the asu was effective for us on july  the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb codified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition 
fasb asu no 
provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
fasb asu no

we do not expect this asu will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as a result of its adoption on january  results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  change change revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest and financing costs  net other income  net including subsidy foreign exchange gain loss income tax expense net income

our products currently are available in approximately  stores as of march beginning in the latter half of  we increased sales of our products to suning  a prominent national electric appliance retail chain in china with roughly stores  under a private label arrangement

in addition  we introduced new product lines in  such as humidifiers and dehumidifiers  bringing our current product offerings up to approximately different product varieties from in these results are on pace with management s plan to capture the fast growth experienced in the china domestic small appliance market 
our sales in south america were million for  a million or increase over our sales in asia were million for  a million or increase over we believe the increase in sales in south america and asia were largely due to emerging wealth in the regions and because those regions experienced less of an impact from the recent financial crisis 
in the longer term  we are optimistic about the south american and asian markets because of their gdp growth and large populations 
our sales in europe were million for  a million or increase over our sales in the middle east were million for  a million or increase over our sales gains in europe and the middle east were largely due to deer gaining market share following the financial crisis 
our sales in the us were million for  a million or decrease over the economic recovery in the us has been slower than anticipated and our us customers placed orders as expected based on the slow recovery 
we expect our us revenues to recover in as the economic recovery progresses and we continue to pursue new large us customers 
following the financial crisis  we believe that many smaller suppliers with limited capital resources went out of business  leading to further consolidation in the industry 
in addition  we noticed that buyers increasingly favored companies with financial strength  higher quality products  sufficient plant capacity and a track record of prompt delivery 
buyers placed greater emphasis on being able to source quality supplies without delays or interruptions 
we utilized this market opportunity to add new accounts and increase sales volume with our existing customers

gross profit our gross margin for was compared to for the increase in gross margin for compared to was due to increased sales in the china domestic market  which has higher margins 
our gross margin is higher in the china domestic market because our own branded products are sold directly to agents for domestic retail locations 
we continue to improve our manufacturing efficiency through in house production of motors and other primary components of our products  thereby benefiting from economies of scale due to higher revenue volume 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of million or from million for selling expenses for increased by or million in comparison to due to our significant increase in revenue 
associated selling costs include advertising to expand the market  increase brand awareness and generate the significant increase in revenue 
general and administrative expenses for increased by or million in comparison to due to the hiring of additional employees to further our growth  an increase in research and development to improve our product quality and introduce new products and trade shows to support our marketing efforts 
interest and financing costs  net interest and financing costs  net  for was a net gain of  an increase of  or from a net loss of  for the change is due principally to interest income increasing from  in to  in and no interest expense in compared to  in financial expense also decreased from  in to  in

foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange loss for was million compared to foreign exchange gain of million for  a decrease of million 
the change is due principally to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was as opposed to for the prc government granted us this special tax rate effective as of because of our high tech enterprise status

we utilized this market opportunity to add new accounts and increase sales volume with our existing customers 
a portion of our expected revenue did decrease due to the economic slowdown in the us and europe 
our revenues in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in these geographic areas were lower than our expectations 
the fourth quarter is typically our best quarter and can account for as much as of our annual sales due to greater volume for christmas in the us and the european market 
yet in the fourth quarter of  our sales were only million  or roughly of our annual sales 
in the first quarter of  our sales were million versus million for the first quarter of  or a drop in revenue 
our revenues in europe and north america decreased during the financial crisis as retailers reduced their inventory levels 

table of contents however  our revenue also increased in due to an increase by retailers of their inventory levels commencing in the second quarter of after such retailers realized their inventories were too low relative to consumer demand 
at that time  many of our smaller competitors who did not have our capital strength  economies of scale and our low cost production abilities went out of business 
our us revenue increased in  which we largely attribute to a gain in market share from our competitors in as the demand for our products came back 
a weak fourth quarter in reduced our expected results 
in  the economic environment improved  but our first quarter was still weaker than expected 
our revenue increased in the first quarter of largely due to improved demand  as we continued to gain market share and experienced improved revenues when compared to the weak first quarter of cost of revenue our cost of revenue for was million  an increase of million or from million for the increased cost of revenue in was due to the increase in sales

general and administrative expenses for decreased by or  in comparison to operating expenses include overhead expenses such as rent  management and staff salaries  general insurance  marketing  accounting  legal and offices expenses 
we have scaled back and consolidated our operations  thus reducing selling  general and administrative expenses to withstand the effect of the global financial crisis 
also  we have contracted out our delta subsidiary beginning in  whereby all delta operations have been run through our winder subsidiary 
as a result of these cost cutting efforts  we have been able to reduce our operating expenses while at the same time increasing our growth in revenue 
interest and financing costs net interest and financing costs  net for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the change is due principally to lower interest expense due to lower borrowings in and higher interest income due to the excess cash invested in interest bearing accounts 
other income expense other income for was  an increase of  or from  for the increase in other income is due to increases in grants received from the prc government for our high tech enterprise status and our hiring of a large number of local workers 
foreign exchange gain foreign exchange gain for was  a decrease of  or from  for we entered into a forward exchange agreement with the bank of china whereby we agreed to sell us dollars to the bank of china at certain rates 
since the contractual rate at which we sold us dollars to the bank of china was greater than the exchange rate on the date of each exchange transaction  we recognized foreign exchange gains

our principal demands for liquidity are to increase sales in china  add capacity  purchase inventory and for sales distribution and general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that the amount of cash we have on hand as of the date of this report  as well as the cash that we will generate from operations  will satisfy these requirements 
other current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
working capital was million 
the current ratio was at december  the following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the years ended december  and cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash flows provided by operating activities for was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the cash flows from operating activities was attributed principally to the net income generated during  an increase in accounts payables  tax payable and bank acceptance outstanding  offset by an increase in our accounts receivable and advances to suppliers 
the increase in account receivable is within our expectations as we continue to increase sales rapidly in the china domestic market  which has longer receivable requirements 
our strongest quarters seasonally are our third and fourth quarters  which is common for the consumer products industry in china 
the higher margin in the china domestic market typically requires payment terms for as long as seven to eight months from the date of shipment 
we historically have not experienced significant bad debts from our customers  therefore  we believe our current receivables are manageable and within expectations 

table of contents we used million in investing activities during  principally for the purchase of land use rights intangible assets for our new production and manufacturing facility that will be located in the wuhu area of central china and for the purchase of other fixed assets of million during cash used in financing activities for was million  which included proceeds from the exercise of warrants of million offset by  in payment of offering costs and the purchase of treasury shares for million 
the following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the years ended december  and cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash flows provided by operating activities for was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the cash flows from operating activities were attributed principally to the net income generated during as of december   our accounts receivable increased by  compared with the balance as of december  the increase in accounts receivable in was due primarily to increased sales 
we intend to continue our efforts to maintain accounts receivable at reasonable levels in relation to our sales 
inventories increased by  from the balance at december   due to the need to increase our inventory levels to keep up with the increase in sales 
our accounts payable increased by  during compared with the balance as of december  other payables increased by  and accrued payroll increased by  for the same period 
unearned revenues  which are payments received before all relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied  decreased by  tax and welfare payable decreased by  and short term loans decreased by  over the same period 
notes payable increased by  due to the receipt of proceeds from new loans entered into during we used million in investing activities during  principally for the construction in progress and purchase of fixed assets 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  which was mainly from proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million offset by million 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment  purchase of raw materials and the expansion of our business  through cash flow provided by operations and funds raised through offerings of our securities  if and when we determine such offerings are required 
we maintain export insurance that covers losses arising from customer rejection of our products  political risk  losses arising from business credit and other credit risks including bankruptcy  insolvency and delay in payment 
the majority of our revenues were denominated in us dollars and expenses were denominated primarily in renminbi 
as we increase our sales in china  we expect a significant component of our revenue to be denominated in renminbi 
there is no assurance that exchange rates between the renminbi and the us dollar will remain stable 
we currently do not engage in currency hedging 
inflation has not had a material impact on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while our operations are in china and our functional currency is the renminbi  a majority of our sales currently are made in the export market and may be denominated in currencies other than renminbi 
in  approximately of our revenues were from the export market 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar  euro and other currencies could result in exchange losses and affect our sales and profitability as we may suffer financial losses when transferring money received outside of china into the country or paying vendors for services performed outside of china 
moreover  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi will affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not engage in forward foreign exchange agreements or other hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future may have limited effectiveness  and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currencies 
we are exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of our raw materials  including plastics  which are derived from petroleum  stainless steel and copper 
we monitor the commodities markets for pricing trends and changes  but we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against raw material fluctuations 
instead  we attempt to mitigate the short term risks of price swings by purchasing raw materials in advance
