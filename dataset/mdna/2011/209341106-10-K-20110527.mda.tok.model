table of contents most of our sales are generated by individual orders through commissioned sales personnel 
we predominately recognize revenue from these orders when we deliver the ordered goods and services 
to a large extent  continued engagement of our company by our customers for successive business opportunities depends upon the customers satisfaction with the quality of products and services we provide 
as such  it is difficult for us to predict with any high degree of certainty the number  size  and profitability of printing services that we expect to provide for more than a few weeks in advance

conversely  revenues tend to be seasonally weaker in the quarters ended june and september

our cost of sales mainly consists of raw materials consumed in the printing process  as well as labor and outside services  such as delivery costs 
paper cost is the most significant component of our materials cost  however  fluctuation in paper pricing generally does not materially impact our operating margins because we typically quote  and subsequently purchase  paper for each specific printing project we are awarded 
as a result  any changes in paper pricing are effectively passed through to customers by our printing businesses 
additionally  our cost of sales includes salary and benefits paid to operating personnel  maintenance  utilities  repair  rental and insurance costs associated with operating our facilities and equipment and depreciation charges 
our selling expenses generally include the compensation paid to our sales professionals  along with promotional  travel and entertainment costs
