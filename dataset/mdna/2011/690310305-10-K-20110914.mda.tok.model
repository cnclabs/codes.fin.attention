overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial position and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection products 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling maintenance contracts and rendering related services  selling spare parts  and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
the majority of our sales are generated through our branded channel  which includes systems integrators and vars  with the remainder from our private label arrangement with our oem  hp 
during fiscal  we experienced decreased revenues related to our oem channel while our branded channel remained relatively constant 
business transition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we fulfilled all our obligations under the hp agreement for supply of tape libraries  however  we will continue to provide spares and services under the agreement 
hp product revenue  including spares  accounted for and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
hp total revenue accounted for and of net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
due in large part to the overall decline in hp revenue  we reported net revenue of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decline in net revenue resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources 
at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock in a private placement for a total issuance price of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
cash management and preservation continue to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar year as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 
management has projected that cash on hand  combined with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next months 
significant changes from our current forecast  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
this could force us to make further reductions in spending  extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting decreases in current assets and current liabilities of million and million  respectively  during fiscal the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities and reduced sales  resulting in lower inventory balances 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to operating activities  a million reduction in our current liabilities associated with our non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements and a million reduction in debt related to the repayment of our note payable to anacomp inc anacomp 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in accrued payroll and employee compensation related to a million liability recorded for an equity instrument modification in the fourth quarter of fiscal offset by a million decrease in accrued payroll related to timing of payment dates 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of these arrangements 
industry trends 
we estimate that the cost of managing digital assets is four times the cost of acquiring storage devices 
furthermore  many smes and smbs are seeking to implement tiered storage for primary and secondary data utilizing a combination of low cost sata serial ata drives and high performance sas serial attached scsi drives 
idc estimates that the total networked attached storage nas market will grow at approximately through  and the growth rate for nas storage systems in price bands up to  where most of our snap server solutions lie  is estimated to be 
according to idc  tape storage still constitutes approximately of the total storage revenue in the global storage market 
sales of tape automation appliances represented and of our revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
recent developments in july  we launched our overlandcare service offerings for our line of snap server nas  snapsan  neo series tape products and reo series vtl solutions 
in august  we terminated our mcf financing agreement pursuant to its terms 
in august  we entered into the credit facility that provides for an million secured revolving loan 
the proceeds of the credit facility may be used to fund our working capital and to fund our general business requirements 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature august  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
generally  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
for products in which software is more than an incidental component  we recognize revenue in accordance with current authoritative guidance for software revenue recognition 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu no 
 software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the new standards change the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in multiple element arrangements and require the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
we adopted these standards effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the adoption of these standards  sales of products which contain both hardware and software components  and for which we had previously concluded that the software was more than incidental are no longer within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance as the hardware and software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
for any multiple element agreement  we allocate the relative fair value to each component 
if in an arrangement we have fair value for undelivered elements but not the delivered element in an arrangement  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element s and the relative fair value is allocated to the delivered element s 
undelivered elements typically include services 
revenue from extended warranty and product service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
we have various royalty arrangements with independent service providers that sell our product and also sell and provide service on our product 
these independent service providers pay a royalty fee for service contracts in place on our product 
the royalty fee is calculated by us for the units covered in the quarter  and agreed to by the service provider  based upon the monthly fee for each unit covered by the independent service provider 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
the licensees provide us with periodic reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made the determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
generally  our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification 
if we fail to identify an account as doubtful  or if we identify an account as uncollectible that is later collected  our results could vary 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
a change in our share based compensation for the year ended june  would have affected our net loss by million 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including  among others  expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
impairment of long lived assets we test for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the related assets 
such impairment charges may be material 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or asset group using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flow analysis  including the discount rates  are determined using management s best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if our future results are significantly different than forecasted  we may be required to further evaluate our long lived assets for recoverability and record impairment charges for these assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
warranty obligations we provide for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with current accounting rules 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
any such unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual  which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative loss from operations other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss a summary of the sales mix by product follows fiscal year tape based products neo series arcvault family disk based products reo series ultamus snap server service spare parts and other vr fiscal compared with fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline was primarily in our oem revenue related to decreased revenue from hp  which represented approximately of net revenue in fiscal compared with of net revenue in fiscal in our branded channel  the decrease in net revenue was attributable to decreased volumes in our apac and emea channels primarily due to the discontinuance of our arcvault and ultamus products offset by increases in units of snap server products 
product revenue net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
net product revenue from our oem customer  hp  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily associated with the fulfillment of our obligations under the product supply portion of the agreement and includes million of previously deferred revenue associated with obligations under the agreement 
we will continue to provide spares and services under the existing agreement 
net product revenue from overland branded products  excluding service revenue  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily associated with decreases of million from arcvault products and million from ultamus products due to the discontinuance of these two products  as well as a decrease of million from reo products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million from snap server products and million from neo products 
we began selling the neo s product in the second quarter of fiscal service revenue net service revenue was relatively constant at million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is primarily associated with lower vr technology royalties 
vr technology royalties during fiscal totaled million compared with million during fiscal gross profit 
overall gross profit was relatively constant at million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal gross margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal primarily related to the increase in higher margin branded product revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
product revenue gross profit on product revenue during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the decrease in net product revenue 
gross margin on product revenue at for fiscal increased from for fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of higher margin products and an improved product mix 
service revenue gross profit on service revenue during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to our transition of a significant portion of service repair from a third party vendor to our own personnel  during the third quarter of fiscal  which reduced our payments to third party vendors 
gross margin on service revenue at for fiscal increased from for fiscal sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense in fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily a result of i a decrease of million in employee and related expenses  including travel costs  associated with a decrease in the average headcount by seven employees  primarily due to the streamlining of our sales force  ii a decrease of million in public relations and advertising expense  including contractor fees  due to restructuring and reductions in marketing programs and bringing previously outsourced projects in house and iii a decrease of million in severance costs associated with the fiscal restructurings 
these decreases were slightly offset by a million increase in share based compensation expense primarily associated with options granted to an executive officer in february research and development expense 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is primarily a result of i an increase of million in employee and related expenses  including travel costs  associated with an increase in average headcount by seven employees associated with the restructuring of our research and development department  including the addition of a chief technology officer  ii an increase of million in outside contractor fees and iii an increase of million in share based compensation expense primarily associated with options granted to an executive officer in march these increases were offset by a million decrease in development expense associated with the timing of new product development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense in fiscal increased to million from million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is primarily a result of i an increase of million in share based compensation expense primarily associated with options granted to executive officers in february  ii an increase of million in executive bonuses  iii an increase of million in outside contractor expenses  principally for financial and accounting services  iv an increase of million in investor relation expenses and v an increase of million in fees associated with the termination of our financing agreement with faunus group international fgi 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease of million in legal fees and ii a decrease of million in severance expense associated with a former executive officer  iii a decrease of million in employee related expenses  including travel costs  associated with a decrease in average headcount by four employees and iv a decrease of million in audit  tax and consulting fees related to our transition to a new public accounting firm 
interest expense

other income expense  net 
during fiscal  we incurred other income expense  net  of million of income compared with million of income during fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the receipt of million from various institutional investors in consideration for a minority ownership interest in any amounts we receive from litigation awards or settlements arising from our patent infringement lawsuit against bdt  dell and ibm and our complaint for patent infringement with the united states international trade commission against the same defendants 
this increase was offset by i a decrease of approximately million in realized currency exchange gains due to foreign currency fluctuations and ii a decrease of million related to the prior year liquidation of our auction rate securities ars 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal the income tax expense in fiscal primarily related to earnings in our foreign operations

cash management and preservation continue to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting decreases in current assets and current liabilities of million and million  respectively  during fiscal the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities and reduced sales  resulting in lower inventory balances 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to operating activities  a million reduction in our current liabilities associated with our non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements and a million reduction in debt related to the repayment of our note payable to anacomp 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in accrued payroll and employee compensation related to a million liability recorded for the stock appreciation rights sar awards in june offset by a million decrease in accrued payroll related to timing of payment dates 
management has projected that cash on hand  combined with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next months 
significant changes from our current forecast  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
this could force us to make further reductions in spending  extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
as a result of our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during fiscal  we used cash in operating activities of million  compared to million in fiscal the use of cash during fiscal was primarily a result of our net loss of million offset by overall decreases in operating assets and liabilities 
the decreases primarily consisted of i a decrease in inventory  ii a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and iii a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales 
we used cash in investing activities of million during fiscal  compared to million cash generated from investing activities in fiscal during fiscal  we acquired intangible assets consisting of existing technology acquired technology for  during fiscal and  capital expenditures totaled million for each year 
such expenditures were associated with machinery and equipment to support new product introductions 
during fiscal  we liquidated our ars for million 
we generated cash from our financing activities of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal in november  we sold  shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors at per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million 
in march  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock in a private placement for a total issuance price of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
during fiscal  we made payments totaling million against the anacomp note  and repayments of million for amounts funded under our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements 
cash generated from financing activities in fiscal primarily relates to the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants for a total issuance price of million and net proceeds of approximately million  and the sale of  shares of our common stock through a public offering of common stock at per share resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million  offset by payments under the notes payable to anacomp and adaptec  which totaled million during fiscal during fiscal  million of cash generated by financing activities related to net funding activity from accounts receivable pledged to mcf and fgi 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties that are not fully recorded in our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments at june  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents contractual lease obligations under non cancellable operating leases on our san diego  california  san jose  california  wokingham  england  and paris  france facilities 
represents purchase orders for inventory and non inventory items entered into prior to june   with purchase dates extending beyond july  some of these purchase obligations may be cancelled 
liabilities associated with uncertain tax provisions  currently estimated at million including interest are not included in the table above as we cannot reasonably estimate when  if ever  an amount would be paid to a government agency 
ultimate settlement of these liabilities is dependent on factors outside of our control  such as examinations by each agency and expiration of statutes of limitation for assessment of additional taxes 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods presented 
historically  we have been able to pass on to our customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation 
if at any time we cannot pass on such increases  our margins could suffer 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and essentially all of our products sold in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france and germany incur costs that are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results may vary from expectations when translated into us dollars  which could adversely impact overall expected results 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations during fiscal and resulted in a loss of million for fiscal and a gain of million for fiscal
