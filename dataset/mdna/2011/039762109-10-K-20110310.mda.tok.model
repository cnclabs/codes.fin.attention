item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other parts of this report and other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently known to the company 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
such statements may be identified by such words as anticipate  expect  may  believe  could  estimate  project  and similar words or phrases 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company changes in economic  political or social conditions our profitability may be impacted by both national and local economic conditions  particularly in southern california 
changes in economic conditions such as recessionary cycles  increased levels of unemployment  higher consumer debt levels  inflation  higher interest rates and tax rates and increased energy costs may result in reduced consumer spending or influence our customers to shift their spending to our lower priced competitors 
the depressed state of the economy  including its impact on the unemployment rate  the financial markets and the real estate markets  as well as the effects of budget uncertainties in california  have and will continue to influence consumer spending patterns in the future 
in addition  current market conditions have continued to limit the amount that the company can charge for its products and the company has continued to emphasize price specials and discount coupons in its advertising 
if the company s sales volume continues to decrease or if the company is unable to pass increased costs on to its customers  profit margins may be negatively affected 
in addition  our business may be subject to interruption from acts of terrorism  national emergencies or natural disasters 
competition in the grocery business the retail grocery business is intensely competitive with respect to price  food quality and selection  service and location 
the company is in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
there are a number of well established competitors with substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than ours  many of which are also nonunion 
the company frequently faces the opening of a new or remodeled competitor s store in its trade area 
consequently  the company also must continually maintain its existing stores in order to retain their appeal 
an inability to successfully compete with other grocery retailers in our trade areas could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability 
food and drug safety concerns there is increasing governmental scrutiny and public awareness regarding food and drug safety 
the company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company s food and drug products 
any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination  drug contamination or food borne illness could result in product liability claims and a loss of consumer confidence 
in addition  adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether valid or not  may discourage consumers from buying the company s products or cause production and delivery disruptions  which could have an adverse effect on the company s sales and results of operations 
new labor contracts and labor stoppages the majority of our employees belong to unions with which we have labor agreements which establish rates of pay  benefits  work rules and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in order to continue to attract and retain quality personnel  we may accept terms that increase our operating costs  which in turn  may negatively impact our profitability 
if contract negotiations are not successful  the union could recommend that our employees vote to strike our stores  distribution center and offices 
in july  the united food commercial workers international union ufcw completed negotiation of a new contract with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area vons  ralphs and albertsons grocery chains majors 
the wage increases agreed to by these three competitors were somewhat less than the company agreed to for certain job classifications and experience levels during our ufcw negotiations in february and march this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose labor costs are less than our own 
our contract with the ufcw expired march   the same date as the majors contract 
the majors are currently in negotiations with the ufcw to renew their collective bargaining agreements 
the company has signed an extension agreement with the ufcw pending the outcome of the ufcw s negotiations with the majors which obligates gelson s to any changes agreed to by the majors in hourly wage rates and contributions to the benefit plans 
cost of providing employee benefits the company provides health insurance for the majority of its nonunion employees  for which the employees pay a portion 
health care costs have increased significantly in recent years 
if this trend continues  it could have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
the status of the recent health care reform makes it more difficult than ever to predict the impact on health care costs in the near future 
the company also contributes to several multi employer union health care plans in accordance with the company s various collective bargaining agreements 
the majority of the company s union employees are members of the ufcw 
the company s ufcw health and welfare contribution rate was scheduled to increase effective with hours worked during march  however  the company was notified by the southern california united food commercial workers unions and the food employers joint trust funds trust  in the first quarter of  that the increase had been suspended 
in march  the company was notified that the ufcw health and welfare contribution rate would increase effective march to the maximum allowable rate under the collective bargaining agreement resulting in a significant increase in the company s health and welfare expense 
the agreement also allowed for an additional increase in the health and welfare contribution rate effective february which has gone into effect 
as discussed above  the company s contract with the ufcw expired march  the ufcw is currently negotiating with the majors 
all employers who participate in a multi employer plan are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plan  and accordingly  the company will be subject to the same contribution rate as negotiated by the majors 
the company has been notified that the ufcw health and welfare plan is currently underfunded 
many factors influence the funded status of the plans including changes in the cost of health care  the plans return on investment  changes to benefits offered under the plans  government regulations and the level of employee utilization 
the company also participates in various multi employer union pension plans 
adverse financial market developments have significantly impacted the funded status of pension plans on a worldwide basis 
the company s contributions under the ufcw pension plan were fixed under the terms of the agreement which expired on march  the economic downturn has had a significant impact on the funded status of the health care and pension plans to which the company contributes 
the company anticipates that both health care and pension benefits will be important topics during negotiations with the ufcw 
if the company and other participating employers are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with the union concerning employee benefits  a labor dispute could result or the negotiations could result in a new agreement requiring higher contribution rates 
in addition  if any of the participating employers in the plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions 
each of these scenarios could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
retention of key personnel our success is dependent on our key employees 
we must continue to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel including the replacement of senior management upon retirement 
individuals of this caliber could be in short supply and this shortage may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and thus  may hinder our ability to operate effectively 
changes in laws or regulations or failure to comply we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and licensing requirements which regulate health and sanitation standards  food labeling and handling  the sale of alcoholic beverages  employment practices  working conditions  citizenship requirements and public accommodations 
changes to such laws or regulations may adversely affect our profitability by increasing our costs or affecting the sale of certain items 
in addition  we must comply with state and local fire  zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect the costs and the operation of our existing stores or could delay or prevent the opening of a new store 
changes in accounting standards  policies and practices the issuance of new pronouncements or changes to existing accounting policies and practices could have a significant impact on our reported results or change the way we account for various transactions 
new policies and changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
availability and retention of retail space we currently lease the majority of our store locations 
typically  our supermarket leases have initial twenty year lease terms and may include options for up to an additional twenty years 
the average term remaining on our supermarket leases  including renewal options  is approximately seventeen years 
our revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew any of these leases at reasonable rates 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new trade areas and to operate these stores successfully 
our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations  and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites 
we may not be able to find suitable locations that meet our demographic and operational requirements at a reasonable cost 
the most recent opening of a gelson s store occurred in september when the company opened its location in pasadena  california 
the ability of our vendors to supply products and services in a timely manner our business is dependent on our ability to purchase products from a large wholesaler and numerous smaller vendors in a timely manner and at competitive prices 
the largest supplier for our stores is unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has provided product for our stores for approximately years 
we currently procure approximately of our product from unified 
any disruption in the business of unified or any of our other principal suppliers could negatively impact our sales and profitability 
even where we have access to alternative sources of supply  the failure of a major supplier to fulfill our orders could temporarily disrupt store level merchandise selection 
ability to control insurance coverage costs and claims experience we use a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for coverage associated with losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  fiduciary  employment practices liability  business interruption  crime  earthquake and health care 
if insurance costs increase  it could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications  cost control measures  sales increases or by improving our operating efficiency 
we are self insured for general and auto liability and  in some prior years  for workers compensation as well 
we have stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure on a per claim basis and are insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
the company devotes substantial time and effort to maintaining a safe environment in our stores  warehouse and offices 
however  the cost of both insured and self insured plans is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of premiums and our ability to manage claims 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings from time to time we are the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging injury  food quality or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former or current employees  claims concerning hazardous substances on our current or previously owned or leased properties  class action suits concerning warning labels and other claims 
a lawsuit or claim could result in a decision against us that could have an adverse effect on our business if not covered by insurance 
additionally  the cost of defending ourselves against lawsuits and claims  regardless of merit  could have a negative impact on our profitability 
impact of local projects in the vicinity of our supermarkets from time to time  local events or projects take place in the vicinity of our stores that may have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 
stock price volatility the market price of our class a common stock class a could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events including general economic and market conditions  variations in our earnings results  publicity regarding the company or its competitors and the grocery business in general 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
furthermore  there is not a significant volume of trading in our class a which subjects our stock price to a higher level of volatility and may adversely impact the liquidity of the stock 
in march  the company merged its stock bonus plan into its k retirement savings plan k plan in order to satisfy the new congressionally mandated diversification requirements 
stock previously held for the benefit of participants in the company s stock bonus plan was transferred to individual participant accounts in the company s k plan 
as of january   participants in the company s k plan held  shares of class a in the k plan 
these participants can elect to sell their shares which may have a negative effect on the price of class a 
fluctuations in our class a price also impact compensation expense as it relates to our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars

overview arden is a holding company which conducts operations through its first and second tier wholly owned subsidiaries  arden mayfair and gelson s  respectively  as well as owning and managing its real estate through mayfair realty which is owned by the company and arden mayfair 
gelson s operates eighteen full service supermarkets in southern california 
gelson s caters to those customers who expect superior quality  service and merchandise selection 
in addition to the customary supermarket offerings  gelson s offers specialty items such as imported foods  unusual delicatessen items  prepared foods and organic and natural food products 
gelson s stores include the typical service departments such as meat  seafood  service deli  floral  sushi  cheese and bakery 
in addition  some stores offer further services including fresh pizza  coffee bars  self service hot and cold food cases  gelato bars and carving carts offering cooked poultry and meats 
the company s management focuses on a number of performance indicators in evaluating financial condition and results of operations 
same store sales  gross profit and labor costs are some of the key factors that management considers 
both sales and gross profit are significantly influenced by competition in our trade area 
gelson s faces competition from regional and national supermarket chains most of which have greater resources and a larger market share than gelson s  stores specializing in natural and organic foods  specialty and gourmet markets and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
the weak economic conditions have led to even greater competition in the grocery industry 
as discretionary income has declined  some consumers have reduced their spending and are making more price conscious decisions which has caused us to compete for fewer customer dollars and has forced us to lower some of our retail prices and offer more promotional discounts as our competitors have also reduced their prices in an attempt to maintain or increase their own market share 
principally  for these reasons  the company has experienced year over year sales decreases since labor and other related payroll costs are the second largest expense after product cost incurred by gelson s  and thus is a financial measure which is monitored by management 
as of the fiscal year end  gelson s had approximately  full time and part time store  warehouse and office employees 
the majority of gelson s employees are members of the ufcw 
the company s current contract with the ufcw expired march  the agreement that the majors currently have with the ufcw provides for hourly wage rates based on job classification and experience levels that  in some cases  are less than those agreed to by gelson s 
the majors are currently in negotiations with the ufcw to renew their collective bargaining agreements which also expired on march  the company has signed an extension agreement with the ufcw pending the outcome of the ufcw s negotiations with the majors which obligates gelson s to any changes agreed to by the majors in hourly wage rates and contributions to the benefit plans 
in addition  certain of the company s warehouse and office employees are members of the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters union 
the company s contract with the teamsters union was renewed in for a five year period expiring september  on terms similar to those reached by the major retailers and wholesaler in our trade area 
the company contributes to a multi employer health care trust and a pension plan trust on behalf of its employees who are members of the ufcw 
all employers who participate in a multi employer plan are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plan 
the company s health and welfare contribution rate was scheduled to increase effective with hours worked during march and after  however  the company was notified by the trust  in the first quarter of  that the increase had been suspended 
in march  the company was notified that the ufcw health and welfare contribution rate would increase effective march to the maximum allowable rate under the collective bargaining agreement  and as a result  average weekly health and welfare expense has been running approximately  higher than prior to that increase 
the expired agreement allowed for an additional increase in the health and welfare contribution rate effective february which has resulted in an additional increase of  per week 
the increase in health and welfare costs  as well as the labor cost issue discussed above  has negatively impacted the company s profitability and will continue to unless the company is able to offset the increased expense through a combination of sales growth  increased gross margin  reduced labor hours and cost savings in other areas 
current economic and competitive conditions make it difficult for the company to achieve significant sales growth and increased profit margins 
the company also participates in various multi employer union pension plans 
adverse financial market developments have significantly impacted the funded status of pension plans on a worldwide basis 
currently  the company s contributions under the ufcw pension plan are fixed under the terms of the current agreement which ended on march  the economic downturn and increases in health care costs have had a significant impact on the funded status of the health care and pension plans to which the company contributes 
many factors influence the funded status of the plans including changes in the cost of health care  the return on investments of funds held by the plans  changes to benefits offered under the plans  government regulations and the level of employee utilization 
the company anticipates that both health care and pension benefits will be important topics during the ufcw negotiations 
if  in the future  the company and other participating employers are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with the union concerning employee benefits  a labor dispute could result or the negotiations could result in a new agreement requiring higher contribution rates 
in addition  if any of the participating employers in the plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions 
each of these scenarios could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
another component of labor related expense is the cost of workers compensation 
for some years prior to july   the company is primarily self insured through the use of a high deductible policy which provides the company with stop loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis and provides coverage for qualifying costs in excess of per claim limits 
since july   the company has purchased fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance to replace the high deductible program 
the guaranteed cost program eliminates the company s risk against claims occurring after june  and has resulted in lower workers compensation expense compared to the high deductible program 
the company continues to maintain an accrual for workers compensation claims incurred prior to july under the high deductible program 
that accrual is based on both undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment  the ultimate cost of workers compensation is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of health care costs and the company s ability to manage claims 
in the past  the company s quarterly results have reflected significant fluctuations in operating income as a result of adjustments recorded to reflect the change in the fair value of sars that have been granted to non employee directors and certain employees 
each sar entitles the holder to receive cash upon exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the company s class a  as determined in accordance with the sars agreement  on the date of exercise over the fair market value of such share on the date granted 
fluctuations in the market price of the company s class a from the end of the previous fiscal year impact the recognition or reversal of sars compensation expense in the year being reported upon 
since the company cannot predict future fluctuations in the market price of its stock  it also cannot forecast future sars compensation expense adjustments and the extent to which operating income will be impacted 
results of operations compared to sales from the company s eighteen supermarkets all of which are located in southern california  including revenue from licensing arrangements  subleases  leases and finance charges  were  in this represents a decrease of from  when sales were  sales were negatively impacted by economic conditions  competition in our trade area and increased promotional discounts 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in in calculating gross profit  the company deducts product costs  net of discounts and allowances  and inbound freight charges  as well as warehouse  transportation  purchasing  advertising and occupancy costs 
gross profit as a percent of sales for the company may not be comparable to those of other companies in the grocery industry since there may be differences in recording certain costs as cost of sales or as selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in the increase in sg a expense as a percent of sales is predominately due to the increase in the health and welfare contribution rate as discussed above 
contributions to the health and welfare trust were somewhat offset by a reduction in labor hours worked as a result of decreased sales 
also  as sales decrease  sg a expense as a percent of sales increases to some degree as certain of the company s costs are fixed and do not decrease proportionately with a decline in revenues 
sg a expense as a percent of sales is also higher due to an increase in ufcw hourly wage rates effective march in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement 
the increase in sg a expense as a percent of sales was partially offset by a gain of  from the early termination of a lease by the landlord of a property that was being leased by amg holdings  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of arden mayfair 
the company contributes to several multi employer union pension and health care plans 
pension and health care payments are determined based on straight time hours worked and the contribution rate as stipulated in the company s various collective bargaining agreements 
the company recognized union pension expense of  in compared to  in union health care expense was  in compared to  in health care costs increased due to an increase in the contribution rate partially offset by a reduction in the number of hours eligible for contributions 
authoritative guidance requires the company to measure and recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of sars 
the fair value must be remeasured each reporting period until the award is settled and compensation expense must be recognized or reversed each reporting period to reflect changes in fair value and vesting 
during  the company reversed  of sars compensation expense recognized in prior periods due to the exchange of shares as discussed below and a decrease in the fair value of sars during the year partially offset by additional vesting 
during  the company reversed  of sars compensation expense 
compensation expense is included under sg a expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as of january   assuming no change in the sars fair value  there was approximately  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding sars which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total intrinsic value of sars exercised during and was and  respectively 
intrinsic value represents the amount by which the fair value of sars exceeds the grant price 
in january  holders of the company s sars with a grant date on or before december  were offered the opportunity to exchange their then outstanding sars units for an equal number of new sars units with a lower grant price of and a new vesting period 
existing grant prices for these units ranged from to 
ordinarily  the grant price is determined based upon the fair market value of a share of the company s class a on the date of grant 
on january   when the exchange offer was made to these sars holders  the class a closing price was per share 
for those holders who accepted the company s exchange offer  the new sars were granted effective january  and expire january  the class a closing price on the january  grant date was 
sar holders who opted to exchange their sars also agreed to restart their vesting period 
the new sars vest each year beginning at the end of the third year and expire seven years from the date of grant

interest and dividend income  net of interest expense  was  in compared to  for individually  both interest income and interest expense increased over the prior year as the company invested in more debentures at a premium 
the amortization of this premium is recorded under interest expense

self insurance reserves the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims and for all open years prior to july  for workers compensation 
the company maintains stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
effective july   the company purchased a fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy for losses occurring after june  this policy replaced the high deductible program for workers compensation 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company under the high deductible programs are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and regression analysis 
accruals are based on undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
the company s liability reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at january  was approximately  employment agreement bernard briskin  chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer of the company has an employment agreement with the company that provides for annual retirement compensation for the remainder of his lifetime equal to of his average base salary and bonus earned in the last three fiscal years prior to his retirement 
the company had accrued  under the terms of the employment agreement as of january  property  plant and equipment purchases as of january   management had authorized expenditures on incomplete projects for the purchase of property  plant and equipment which totaled approximately  the company has an ongoing program to remodel existing supermarkets and to add new stores 
during  total capital expenditures were  standby letters of credit all of the company s letters of credit renew automatically each year unless the issuer notifies the company otherwise 
the amount of each outstanding letter of credit pursuant to the company s workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance programs will be adjusted annually based upon the outstanding claim reserves as of the renewal date 
each letter of credit obligation related to insurance will cease when all claims for the particular policy year are closed or the company negotiates a release 
in march  the company announced a stock repurchase program  authorized by the board of directors  to purchase from time to time up to  shares of its class a in the open market or in private transactions 
this was in addition to  shares remaining under prior repurchase authorizations 
the timing  volume and price of purchases are at the discretion of the management of the company 
no stock was repurchased under this program in  or during  and  the company paid regular quarterly dividends of cents per share of class a for a total of approximately  in each year 
in addition  the company paid a special cash dividend of twenty five dollars per share on its outstanding class a totaling approximately  on december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to reflect the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories and cost of sales supermarket nonperishable inventories are recorded using the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo basis or market 
under the retail inventory method  cost of sales is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to sales for the period to determine cost of sales 
cost of sales is then deducted from beginning inventory plus purchases to arrive at ending inventory 
the company performs physical inventories of nonperishable items at all of its locations three times per year  at which time  ending inventory and cost of sales are adjusted to reflect actual inventory on hand and cost of sales 
physical inventories of perishable products are conducted at the end of each fiscal month 
approximately and of the company s inventories were valued using the lifo method as of january  and january   respectively 
the lifo method assumes that the cost of the most recently purchased items are the first to be sold  and thus  are used to measure cost of sales  leaving the earlier costs residing in the ending inventory valuation 
the company uses the link chain  dollar value method for purposes of calculating its lifo charge or credit each year for nonperishable inventories 
this method requires management to compute a cumulative price index which represents the change in inventory cost since the base year ie  the beginning of the year in which lifo was first elected compared to the current cost of inventory 
the cumulative index is then applied to the current cost of inventory to determine the value of inventory at base year costs 
this computation is performed separately for each of the company s individual lifo pools ie  groupings of similar items such as basic grocery  housewares  alcoholic beverages  etc 
the lifo method requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory mix and factors related to the computation of price indices which could impact the ending inventory valuation as well as cost of sales 
if the fifo method had been used for nonperishable inventories instead of the lifo method  total inventory as of january  and january  would have been higher by approximately  and  respectively 
the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts at its stores and warehouse 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
although the company has sufficient historical data to record reasonable estimates of inventory shortages  actual results could differ 
as of january   a difference between actual and estimated shortages of  for example  basis points would have an annual impact of approximately  on cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows undiscounted and before interest charges are less than carrying value 
the factor that most significantly affects the impairment calculation is management s estimate of future cash flows which is inherently uncertain and relies on various assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
the company s cash flow projection looks several years into the future and includes assumptions such as the rate of inflation deflation  the strength of the economy  competition in our trade area  the ability to secure subtenants and the company s ability to negotiate early termination agreements 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets could occur 
to the extent that an asset is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against earnings 
no asset impairment charges or adjustments were recognized during fiscal  or workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance the company is primarily self insured i for losses for all years related to general and auto liability claims and ii for some years prior to july  for workers compensation 
where primarily self insured  the company purchases stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
related accruals are based on undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the amount of reserves for reported claims are determined by a third party administrator claims representative who considers the individual facts of each claim including severity in arriving at an estimate of the company s total exposure 
in addition  the company analyzes its historical paid and incurred loss trends in order to further develop an estimate of its ultimate cost of reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and historical trends are not an absolute indication of future results  and the company reevaluates these reserves quarterly based on the most current information available 
the ultimate cost of claims are impacted by numerous variables including the frequency and severity of claims  legal and legislative trends  changes in benefit levels  the rate of inflation and claim settlement patterns 
since july   the company has purchased fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance thereby limiting its exposure for workers compensation to the cost of the related insurance premium 
the company s self insured workers compensation accrual for claims incurred prior to july decreased from  at the beginning of fiscal to  at the end of the year as a result of payments of  which amount was partially offset by reserve adjustments of  the company expects the workers compensation reserve to continue to decline as it continues to pay down and close outstanding workers compensation claims which occurred prior to july  the company s reserves for general and auto liability claims increased by approximately  during fiscal the net increase reflects a net accrual  including reserve adjustments  of  partially offset by payments of  vendor allowances the company receives a variety of allowances from its vendors whose products are sold in gelson s stores 
typically  the vendors are paying the company to promote their products 
the promotion may be a temporary price reduction  a feature in a print advertisement or newsletter  placement of the vendor s product in a preferred location in a store or introduction of a new product 
the promotions range from approximately two weeks to six months and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor allowances as a reduction of cost of sales  as well as the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory  requires management judgment and estimates 
management estimates current year purchase volume based on projected and historical data 
in turn  the estimated purchase volume is used to determine the amount of vendor allowances to recognize each period 
the company does not expect that there will be a significant change in the annual level of vendor support  however  a one percent change in total vendor funds earned would likewise impact gross profit by approximately 
as a percent of sales 
stock appreciation rights outstanding sars are revalued at the end of each quarter using the black scholes option pricing model which incorporates various highly subjective assumptions  including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and a risk free interest rate 
the fair value of sars  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model  does not necessarily reflect the amount that will be paid out in accordance with the sars agreement on the date of exercise 
in addition  changes in the market price of the company s class a can and have significantly impacted the recognition or reversal of sars expense 
recent accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements of assets and liabilities  including the amounts of significant transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers  the reasons for any transfers in or out of level  and information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of recurring level fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation of assets and liabilities  and information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
except for certain detailed level disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years  the new guidance became effective for the company s first quarter of the company did not have transfers of assets or liabilities in or out of level fair value measurements and does not have assets or liabilities requiring level fair value measurements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company currently has no outstanding bank debt or fixture financing 
if the company should borrow in the future  the company could then be exposed to market risk related to interest fluctuations 
a change in market prices exposes the company to market risk related to its investments 
as of january   all investments were classified as available for sale securities and totaled  a hypothetical drop in the market value of these investments would result in a  unrealized loss and a corresponding decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
this hypothetical drop would not affect cash flow and would not have an impact on earnings until the company sold the investments
