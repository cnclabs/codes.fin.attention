overview edgewater is a strategic consulting firm that brings a synergistic blend of specialty services in the areas of business advisory  analytics  data management  and technology to its client base 
during the fiscal year ended december   we generated revenues  including software revenue and reimbursement of out of pocket expenses  of approximately million from a total of clients 
headquartered in wakefield  massachusetts  as of december   our company employed approximately consulting professionals and total professionals 
as we advanced through  we reported improved and or sustained quarterly operating metrics on both a sequential and year over year basis 
the improvements in our business are primarily attributable to the strategic initiatives we planned in and implemented in these initiatives are described in further detail under factors influencing our results of operations revenue 
we have observed an increase in our bid and proposal activities related to our traditional management  technical and enterprise management consulting service offerings which are collectively referred to herein as our core service offerings  we have experienced year over year organic growth in service revenue related our core service offerings  and we have experienced growth in our fullscope erp related service offering 
the cumulative effect of these trends is reflected in our year over year growth in total revenue and service revenue  improvement in our billable consultant utilization rate and improvement in our gross margin 
while our operating metrics are still below our historical and targeted ranges  has been a year of recovery and improvement in our business 
factors influencing our results of operations revenue 
the company derives its service revenue from time and materials based contracts  fixed price contracts and fixed fee arrangements 
time and materials based contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates 
revenue pursuant to fixed price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting 
fixed price contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue under fixed fee contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period  as outlined within the respective contract 
fixed fee contracts represented of service revenue during the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenue is recognized and billed as services are performed 
for fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
provisions for estimated profits or losses on uncompleted projects are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined 
on many projects  we are reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenue and cost of revenue 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 

table of contents as disclosed in our periodic sec filings  our quarterly and annual operating results were significantly impacted by a dramatic slowdown in the it consulting services business environment 
however  we proactively responded to these challenges through a systematic reorientation of the company s strategic direction  service offerings and resources  which we believe has positioned the company to respond to and capitalize upon the changing needs of the marketplace 
each of the strategic initiatives we have implemented the development of new service offerings  the cross disciplinary training of our billable consultant resources and focusing our sales efforts on new technologies was under taken with the specific goal of transforming the company s it service offerings towards a product based consulting model 
our strategic migration to a product based consulting model was accelerated by our december  acquisition of fullscope  inc fullscope  which specializes in erp related consulting services 
the addition of fullscope s services to our existing service offering portfolio enables the company to provide our customers with a comprehensive range of product based services 
in connection with our migration to more of a product based consulting model  we anticipate that software revenue will continue to be a significant portion of our revenue 
software revenue is expected to fluctuate between quarters dependent upon our customers demand for such third party off the shelf software 
fluctuations in software revenue may have an impact upon our periodic operating performance  including gross margin 
as a result of the anticipated margins associated with our product sales and their impact upon our quarterly operating performance  we have started to measure our business with regards to total revenue  as opposed to our historical approach of evaluating and discussing our operating results solely in connection with service revenue 
operating expenses 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting costs  third party vendor payments and non billable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge our clients and the non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expense consists of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue levels 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing client engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new client assignments 

table of contents company performance measurement systems and metrics 
the company s management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators on an ongoing basis 
for example  we regularly review performance information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant  periodic consultant utilization rates  gross profit margins  average bill rates and billable employee headcount 
edgewater has also developed internal enterprise performance management systems which aid us in measuring our operating performance and consultant utilization rates 
the matching of sales opportunities to available skill sets in our consultant base is one of our greatest challenges and therefore  we monitor billable consultant utilization closely 
these metrics  along with other operating and financial performance metrics  are used in evaluating management s overall performance 
these metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
increase in professional services and embezzlement related expenses 
during the year ended december   we are reporting a year over year increase in our professional service related expenses 
the current year expense increase is primarily attributable to certain non routine expenses  which totaled million 
specific non routine expenses incurred by the company related to the following acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately thousand in professional service related expenses directly associated with our acquisitions of fullscope  inc the fullscope acquisition and meridian consulting international the meridian acquisition 
our stated goal is to continue to pursue strategic growth initiatives focused upon making our company a leading provider of specialty information technology consulting services 
our strategic growth initiatives may be based upon the expansion of our existing core service offerings or through the acquisition of new and or complementary service or product based offerings 
pursuing either of these growth avenues may cause the company to incur non routine operating expenses in connection with our investment in a particular growth initiative 
employee embezzlement related costs 
on july   the company issued a press release related to the discovery of embezzlement activities at fullscope  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries the fullscope embezzlement issue 
based upon the results of forensic accounting procedures  we concluded that the embezzlement activities did not have a material impact upon our previously issued financial statements specifically our quarterly report on form q for the three month period ended march   which represents the only reporting period prior to identification of the embezzlement during which fullscope s operating results were included as part of edgewater s consolidated results 
in the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million in non routine operating expenses associated with the embezzlement issue 
the costs incurred by the company included thousand in professional services related expenses such as forensic audit and legal related costs  thousand in connection with write off of embezzled accounts receivable balances  and thousand related to the establishment of an accrual for estimated pre acquisition sales and use tax exposure 
these amounts were reduced by thousand in insurance proceeds received by the company during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  in connection with our review of the impact of the discovered embezzlement activity upon fullscope s historical financial statements  the company recorded a thousand liability associated with potential pre acquisition sales and use tax obligations 
the potential sales and use tax related liability was created by the methods employed by a former employee of fullscope to conceal the discovered fraudulent activity 
while the company has accounted for this liability as a period expense  we believe that any amounts actually paid to resolve this issue will be recoverable from an existing  fully funded escrow account which was established in connection with our acquisition of fullscope 
future amounts recovered  if any  will be recorded by the company in the period in which the amounts are determined to be probable of recovery from escrow 

table of contents we anticipate that we may continue to incur additional expenses associated with the fullscope embezzlement issue as we intend to aggressively pursue recovery through all possible avenues  including a claim against the escrow account established in connection with the fullscope acquisition 
we believe that we may be able to recover some  if not all  of the receivable amounts embezzled  plus the professional expenses we have incurred to date  or will incur in the future  addressing this situation 
plans for growth and acquisitions 
our goal is to continue to build one of the leading strategic consulting firms in north america by growing our client base  leveraging our industry expertise to enhance our service offerings and continue to make disciplined strategic acquisitions 
previous acquisitions have further expanded our geographical footprint  increased our vertical expertise and have provided more scale to our organization 
consistent with our strategy of growth  we consummated one acquisition during on may   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of meridian consulting international  pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement the meridian acquisition 
headquartered in chicago  illinois  meridian is a specialty solution provider of oracle s hyperion strategic finance product which encompasses strategic planning and forecasting  scenario modeling and mergers and acquisitions analysis 
meridian has delivered its services to organizations across various vertical markets including energy  higher education  retail and healthcare 
the acquisition of meridian continues our investment in epm related service offerings and aligns with our product centric service offering model 
the addition of meridian s strategic finance capabilities positions edgewater as one of the few domestic based companies with the capability to provide the full suite of oracle s epm service offerings 
the acquisition is more fully described in
