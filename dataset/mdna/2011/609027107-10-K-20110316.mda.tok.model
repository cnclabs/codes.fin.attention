operating results summary below is a summary of our results for the years ended december for  and  respectively amounts in millions  except per share amounts percentage increase decrease vs vs casino revenues food and beverage revenues hotel revenues other revenues net revenues sales  general and admin expense income from operations net income earnings per share diluted operating margin pts pts our results for the year ended december  reflect improvement from our results in which suffered from the effects of the challenging operating environment that began in the three month period ended december  as in many other areas around the country  the economic downturn in northern nevada in the fourth quarter of has deepened throughout  and other factors causing negative financial impact that continued from the fourth quarter of were aggressive discounting programs by our competitors 
in response to these challenges  we increased promotional expenditures to attract and retain guests 
furthermore  based on statistics released by the nevada gaming control board  the reno gaming market has shrunk in the aggregate 
despite these headwinds  we successfully increased net revenue  income from operations and net income for the year ended december  compared to we believe these results are primarily attributable to the improvements to our facility see the capital spending and development section below and strong execution of service standards both of which we believe have improved the experience our customer s receive when they come to the atlantis 
our results reflect a thousand one time charge related to the demolition of our room motor lodge in the fourth quarter of the quality of the room product of the motor lodge was no longer consistent with the higher standards of our upgraded facilities 
we converted the motor lodge to paved surface parking right next to the atlantis 
in october  we launched a new program under the club paradise program called ez comp sm 
among other things  the technology allows atlantis patrons to see their redeemable complimentary point balances 
prior to the launch of the ez comp sm program  we recognized expense at the time complimentary points were redeemed and the redemption value was at our discretion 
under the new program  we recognize complimentaries expense at the time points are earned  which occurs commensurate with casino patron play 
the redemption value is now known to the patron 
this change in the our program resulted in a one time  non cash charge in of approximately million to recognize the liability for redeemable complimentary point balances on the date the ez comp sm program was launched 
the factors described above were the primary drivers of increases of   and in our casino  food and beverage  hotel and other revenues  respectively  resulting in a net revenue increase of  a increase in income from operations  an increase in our operating margin by points or 
capital spending and development we seek to continuously upgrade and maintain the atlantis facility in order to present a fresh  high quality product to our guests 
in june  we broke ground on an expansion project several phases of which we completed and opened in the second half of new space was added to the first floor casino level  the second and third floors and the basement level totaling approximately  square feet 
the existing casino floor was expanded by over  square feet  or approximately 
the first floor casino expansion includes a redesigned  updated and expanded race and sports book of approximately  square feet and an enlarged poker room 
the expansion also included the new manhattan deli  a new york deli style restaurant 
the second floor expansion created additional ballroom and convention space of approximately  square feet  doubling the existing facilities 
we constructed and opened a pedestrian skywalk over peckham lane that connects the reno sparks convention center directly to the atlantis 
in january  we opened the final phase of the expansion project  the new spa atlantis featuring an atmosphere  amenities and treatments that are unique from any other offering in our market 
additionally  many of the pre expansion areas of the atlantis were remodeled to be consistent with the upgraded look and feel of the new facilities 
through the completion date in january  the company had incurred approximately million related to these capital projects 
with the opening of the new skywalk the atlantis became the only hotel casino to be physically connected to the reno sparks convention center 
the reno sparks convention center offers approximately  square feet of leasable exhibition  meeting room  ballroom and lobby space 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in during and capital expenditures primarily consisted of construction costs associated with the expansion  skybridge and redesign capital projects that commenced in june during we also spent approximately million to acquire two additional land parcels with buildings within close proximity to the atlantis see additional discussion of these parcels below under properties in item capital expenditures in were for various general facility improvements and for purchase of additional gaming equipment 
future cash needed to finance ongoing capital expenditures is expected to be available from operating cash flow  the credit facility see the credit facility below and  if necessary  additional borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance reserves  concentration of credit risk  the calculation of income tax liabilities and the calculation of share based compensation  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodologies applied  our significant accounting policies are discussed where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of monarch  golden road  high desert and golden north 
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company extends short term credit to its gaming customers 
such credit is non interest bearing and is due on demand 
in addition  the company also has receivables due from hotel guests which are primarily secured with a credit card at the time a customer checks in 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is set up for all company receivables based upon the company s historical collection and write off experience  unless situations warrant a specific identification of a necessary reserve related to certain receivables 
the company charges off its uncollectible receivables once all efforts have been made to collect such receivables 
the book value of receivables approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the receivables 
self insurance reserves we are currently self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for workers compensation and certain medical benefit costs provided to our employees 
the company reviews self insurance reserves at least quarterly 
the reserve is determined by reviewing the actual expenditures for the previous twelve month period and reports prepared by the third party plan administrator for any significant unpaid claims 
the reserve is an amount estimated to pay both reported and unreported claims as of the balance sheet date 
we believe changes in medical costs  trends in claims of our employee base  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for this reserve 
unforeseen developments in existing claims  or the possibility that our estimate of unreported claims differs materially from the actual amount of unreported claims  could result in the over or under estimation of our self insurance reserve 
casino revenues casino revenues represent the net win from gaming activity  which is the difference between wins and losses 
additionally  net win is reduced by a provision for anticipated payouts on slot participation fees progressive jackpots and any pre arranged marker discounts 
progressive jackpot provision estimates are determined based on the award amount and the statistical probability of a player receiving that award 
the frequency of future progressive jackpot awards could vary from the statistical probability used in determining the estimate 
promotional allowances our frequent player program  club paradise  allows members  through the frequency of their play at the casino  to earn and accumulate points which may be redeemed for a variety of goods and services at the atlantis 
points may be applied toward room stays at the hotel  food and beverage consumption at the food outlets  gift shop items as well as goods and services at the spa and beauty salon 
points earned may also be applied toward off property events such as concerts  shows and sporting events 
points may not be redeemed for cash 
the retail value of hotel  food and beverage services provided to customers without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
the cost of the products and services provided is reported as casino operating expense 
income taxes income taxes are recorded in accordance with the liability method pursuant to authoritative guidance 
under the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes  the following basic principles are applied in accounting for income taxes at the date of the financial statements a a current liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on taxes for the current year  b a deferred income tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  c the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on the provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated  and d the measurement of deferred income taxes is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based upon available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes 
under the accounting guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in current and noncurrent tax liabilities  based on when expected to be recognized  within the consolidated balance sheets at december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
it requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period 
we calculate the grant date fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions which include the expected term of options granted  risk free interest rates  expected volatility  and expected rates of dividends 
we estimated an expected term for each stock option grant based on the weighted average time between grant date and exercise date and the risk free interest rate assumption was based on us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
we used historical data and projections to estimate expected volatility and expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the estimate of the stock options fair value 
in our judgment  the most volatile input for our company has been the expected volatility assumption which has fluctuated significantly from to and then again to for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations compared with for the year ended december   we earned net income of million  or per diluted share  on net revenues of million  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  on net revenues of million for the year ended december  income from operations totaled million for  a increase when compared to million for casino revenues totaled million in  an increase of from the million reported in  driven by increases in slot  table games  poker and keno win 
we believe these increased revenues are the result of the improvements to our facility described in the capital spending and development section above combined with strong service delivered to our guests 
casino operating expenses were of casino revenues in compared to in the increase was primarily due to the cost of increased complimentary food  beverages and other services provided to casino patrons 
food and beverage revenues increased to million in from million in  due primarily to a increase in average revenue per cover combined with a increase in the number of covers served 
food and beverage operating expenses as a percentage of food and beverage revenue decreased slightly to in from in primarily related to lower food and other commodity prices 
hotel revenues increased to million in from million in increases in both hotel occupancy and the average daily room rate adr combined with revenue from a per day resort fee resort fee  paid by our hotel guests  which we implemented on june  drove the revenue increase 
hotel revenues for the first six months of also include a per occupied room energy surcharge 
this energy surcharge was suspended when we implemented the resort fee 
the atlantis adr was in compared to in the average occupancy rate at the atlantis was compared to in hotel operating expenses decreased to of hotel revenues in  compared to in due primarily to the increase in hotel revenue combined with lower payroll  benefits and overall maintenance expense 
promotional allowances increased to million in compared to million in as a percentage of gross revenue  the amount in increased to as compared to for the increase is attributable to higher promotional efforts to maintain existing  and generate additional  revenues 
other revenues in increased to million  or  compared to primarily due to greater sales in our gift and sundry shops and higher revenues from our new spa that opened in january of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses remained flat at million for both and  respectively 
as a percentage of net revenue  sg a decreased to in as compared to in due to the increase in net revenue without a corresponding increase in sg a expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of compared to million in due primarily to the completion and capitalization of the capital projects described under the capital spending and development section above 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in due to decreased borrowings under our credit facility combined with lower interest rates see the credit facility below
