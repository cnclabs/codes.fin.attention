item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview genvec  inc genvec  we  our  or the company is a biopharmaceutical company using differentiated  proprietary technologies to create superior therapeutics and vaccines 
a key component of our strategy is to develop and commercialize our product candidates through collaborations 
genvec is working with leading companies and organizations such as novartis  merial  and the us government to support a portfolio of product programs that address the prevention and treatment of a number of significant human and animal health concerns 
genvec s development programs address therapeutic areas such as hearing loss  balance disorders  and cancer  as well as vaccines against infectious diseases including respiratory syncytial virus rsv  herpes simplex virus type hsv  dengue fever  influenza  malaria  and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 
in the area of animal health we are developing vaccines against foot and mouth disease fmd 
our core technology has the important advantage of localizing protein delivery in the body 
this is accomplished by using our adenovector platform to locally deliver genes to cells  which then direct production of the desired protein 
this approach reduces side effects typically associated with systemic delivery of proteins 
for vaccines  the goal is to induce an immune response against a target protein or antigen 
this is accomplished by using an adenovector to deliver a gene that causes production of an antigen  which then stimulates the desired immune reaction by the body 
our research and development activities yield product candidates that utilize our technology platform and we believe represent potential commercial opportunities 
for example  preclinical research in hearing loss and balance disorders suggests delivery of the atonal gene using genvec s adenovector technology may have the potential to restore hearing and balance function 
we are working with novartis institutes for biomedical research  inc together with novartis ag and its subsidiary corporations  including novartis pharma ag  novartis  on the discovery and development of novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
there are currently no effective treatments available for patients who have lost all balance function  and hearing loss remains a major unmet medical problem 
in partnership with our collaborators we have multiple vaccines in development 
these programs are funded by third parties and utilize our core adenovector technology 
genvec has grant supported preclinical programs to develop vaccine candidates for the prevention of rsv and hsv in addition  we have a collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the national institutes of health nih to develop a hiv vaccine and an influenza virus vaccine 
we also have programs with the us naval medical research center to develop vaccines for dengue fever and malaria 
in the field of animal health  we are working with merial to commercialize vaccines for the prevention of a major animal health problem  fmd 
development efforts for this program are also supported by the us department of homeland security and in collaboration with the us department of agriculture 
our business strategy is focused on entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the development for one or more of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 

table of contents an element of our business strategy is to pursue  as resources permit  the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
however  we believe that we have sufficient operating capital to continue our current research  development and collaborative activities for at least months 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner

years ended december  in millions tnferade vaccines hearing other clinical programs total tnferade 
we are evaluating our tnferade tm biologic tnferade for use in the treatment of cancer 
using our core adenovector technology  tnferade stimulates the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf  a known anti tumor protein in cells of the tumor 
in march  we discontinued a phase pivotal trial for first line treatment of inoperable  locally advanced pancreatic cancer known as pact based on results of an interim analysis 
the interim data strongly suggested that the trial would not achieve the statistical significance required to form the basis for approval of a biological license application in the population chosen for study  thereby warranting discontinuing the trial 
tnferade is also being evaluated for possible use in the treatment of other types of cancer 
clinical trials have been conducted and encouraging results have previously been reported in studies for esophageal cancer  head and neck cancer  rectal cancer  and soft tissue sarcomas 
we believe that identifying an appropriate partner for tnferade represents the best path forward in the development of the product 
genvec has incurred million of expenses on the development of this product candidate since the commencement of this program in costs since the commencement of this program include research  development  clinical trials  clinical supply costs  and an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses 
vaccines 
under our corporate and government funded vaccine programs  genvec continues to develop vaccine candidates against malaria  hiv  rsv  hsv  and other infectious diseases  as well as an animal health vaccine for fmd 
since commencement of these vaccine development programs in  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which have been funded under our agreements with our various sponsors 
we have recently entered into a collaboration with merial to commercialize vaccines for the prevention of a major animal health problem  fmd 
development efforts for this program are also supported by the us department of homeland security and in collaboration with the us department of agriculture 

table of contents to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities  and debt financings 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums  and other general corporate expenditures 
we have taken steps to lower our operating costs in order to increase our efficiency 
we expect that lowering costs  in addition to what we expect will be increased revenues in from funded collaborations  can provide us with at least months of operating capital from the balance sheet date  subject to changes in the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the service or products have occurred  and collectability of the contract amounts is considered probable 
our collaborative research and development agreements can provide for upfront license fees  research payments  and or substantive milestone payments 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
non refundable research and development fees for which no future performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
substantive milestone payments are considered performance payments and are recognized upon achievement of the milestone if all of the following criteria are met i achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  ii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and iii the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
determination of whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves the judgment of management 
research and development revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus fixed fee agreements is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revisions in revenues  cost  and billing factors eg indirect rate estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted 
table of contents to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
estimated contractual allowances are provided based on management s evaluation of current contract terms and past experience with disallowed costs and reimbursement levels 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
clinical trial expenses and research and development activities 
we accrue estimated costs for clinical and preclinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
we believe this method best aligns our expenses with the efforts we expend 
we monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible and adjust the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known  all adjustments to date have been inconsequential 
the expenditures necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines

clinical phase estimated completion date phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test potential product candidates in preclinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation based on the estimated grant date fair value of the stock using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated grant date fair value is recognized in earnings over the requisite service period 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures 
this asu amends topic and related guidance within us gaap to require disclosure of the transfers in and out of levels and and a schedule for level that separately identifies purchases  sales  issuances and settlements and requires more detailed disclosures regarding valuation techniques and inputs 
the company adopted this standard effective january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial statements 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb asc topic this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance changes how to determine the fair value of undelivered products and services for separate revenue recognition 
allocation of consideration under this pronouncement is based on management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered items where there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application permitted 
we do not anticipate a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in april  fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as successful completion of phases in a study or achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts 
the amendments in this asu provide guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we have historically followed the milestone method and we do not anticipate a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased revenue of million generated by our hearing loss and balance disorder program 
we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis in january  which accounted for million of revenue in  and a development agreement related to the supply of clinical trial material related to activities under the collaboration agreement in august  which accounted for million in revenue in the two novartis agreements resulted in increased revenue in as compared to when the only work performed for our hearing loss and balance disorder program was performed under a grant from the university of kansas 
partially offsetting the increased revenue associated with our hearing loss and balance disorder program is decreased revenue of million and million associated with our hiv and fmd programs  respectively  as compared to the prior year periods due to reduced work scope under each program 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to the development of tnferade including personnel  manufacturing costs  patient costs  and professional service costs related to our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  due to the termination of the clinical trial in the first quarter of stock based compensation expense included in research and development personnel costs increased approximately  in as compared to the prior year 
research and development personnel costs includes no severance expenses for former employees in  a decrease of approximately  as compared to 
table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to higher professional service cost and facility costs  partially offset by lower depreciation costs

gain loss on disposal of assets 
there was no gain loss on the disposal of assets in and a gain of  in other income loss total other income increased to  in from a net loss of  in interest income was  in as compared to  in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower yields earned on our portfolio of investments 
interest expense for the period ending december  decreased  as compared to the comparable prior year period due to adjustments in the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge in as compared to the comparable period in in there was a net expense of  resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrant liability as compared to a net income of  in other income loss was income of  in as compared to a loss of  in in  we received a grant in the amount of  under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program under d of the internal revenue code code  as added to the code by section a of the patient protection and affordable care act of this income was partially offset by the write down of shelf registration costs of  in associated with the shelf registration statement 
the loss in resulted primarily from the expensing of the remaining  of deferred financing charges when our ceff expired on march   partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in is primarily due to decreased revenue associated with our agreement with the department of homeland security dhs of million 
the lower revenue under the dhs agreement is a result of the decreased work scope and effort in as compared to the period 
the decreased revenue associated with our dhs agreement has been partially offset by increased revenue of million under our hiv program as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this increase is mostly due to the successful completion of the defined process development and quality control activities during under our hiv agreements 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to the development of tnferade including manufacturing and materials costs  patient and data management costs  professional service costs related to our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  and decreased personnel costs 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development personnel costs decreased approximately  in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in severance expenses of approximately  for former employees in as compared to the prior year 
also contributing to the decreased costs  but to a lesser extent  are decreased pass through costs associated with our funded programs  most notably pass through costs associated with our fmd program

the loss in is due mainly to the recording of a loss associated with an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a marketable equity security acquired in as consideration for the release of certain security interests in a third party of  partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant losses since our inception 
as of december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work and clinical trial work  as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   cash and investments totaled million as compared to million at december  for the months ended december   we used net cash of million for operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  which included approximately million of non cash depreciation and amortization and million of non cash stock based compensation expenses 
net cash was used primarily for the advancement of our hearing program  the advancement and subsequent termination of our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial and to a lesser extent general and administrative activities 
net cash used in investing activities during the months ended december  was million which was used for property and equipment purchases 
net cash provided from financing activities during the months ended december  was million  which was provided from the issuance of common stock and warrants  net of issuance costs

payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases   severance agreements total contractual obligations    historically we have entered into agreements with academic medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
in february  we filed a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration statement  with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration was declared effective february  and allowed us to obtain financing through the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt securities 
on june   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
during the year ended december   individual investors exercised a portion of these warrants and purchased  shares of common stock for gross proceeds to the company of  the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the remaining warrants have been registered on the shelf registration statement 
on may   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to an institutional investor for the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
during the year ended december   the institutional investor exercised a portion of these warrants and purchased  shares of common stock for gross proceeds to the company of million 
the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the remaining warrants have been registered on the shelf registration statement 
on august   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to an institutional investor of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
during the year ended december   the institutional investor exercised all of these warrants for gross proceeds to the company of million 
on february   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants were offered in units consisting of one share of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of common stock at a per unit price of 
the warrants  which have a term of five years and an exercise price of per share  have been valued using the black scholes pricing model as of the closing date and have been accounted for in permanent equity 
the estimated fair market value of the warrants at the date of issuance was million 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the remaining warrants have been registered on the shelf registration statement 
there were no warrants that were issued in connection with this transaction that were exercised during on february   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s  which we later amended on may  the shelf registration statement 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective may  and allows us to issue any combination of common stock  preferred stock  or warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock 

table of contents on may   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq stating that the minimum bid price of our common stock was below per share for consecutive business days and that we were therefore not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in marketplace rule the notification letter stated that we would be afforded until november  to regain compliance 
in order to obtain additional time to seek to regain compliance  we transferred our common stock to the nasdaq capital market effective november  on november   nasdaq notified us that we would have an additional days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements 
to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock will have had to meet or exceed per share for at least ten consecutive business days prior to may  if we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by may   nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be delisted 
at that time  we may appeal nasdaq s delisting determination to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
on march   the company filed and mailed a proxy statement relating to a special meeting to be held on april  for the purpose of voting on a one for ten reverse stock split 
the purpose of the stock split is for raising the per share trading price of our common stock and to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
on january  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with novartis to discover and develop novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed the world wide rights to our preclinical hearing loss and balance disorders program to novartis 
concurrent with entry into the agreement with novartis  we sold  shares of our common stock to novartis pharma ag in a private placement for per share of common stock  which represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and was calculated based on the average of the closing price for the common stock on the nasdaq global market for the consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to the sale of the shares 
the purchase of the shares of common stock by novartis pharma ag was undertaken in partial consideration for the rights granted under the research collaboration and license agreement 
due to the pricing formula used in the sale of the common stock  a discount of approximately million has been recorded against the upfront license payment and the value of stock associated with this sale is recorded in equity at million 
our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors  including the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we have also taken and are continuing to take steps to lower our operating costs in order to increase our efficiency 
these steps included our announcement on january  that we eliminated positions 
we currently estimate we will use approximately to million of cash in the months ending december  our estimate includes approximately million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above  as well as million for capital expenditures 
based on this estimate we have sufficient resources to fund our operations for at least months from the balance sheet date 
our business strategy is focused on entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
if we seek strategic alliances  licenses  or other alternative arrangements  such as arrangements with collaborative partners or others  we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates  or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
we also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to help offset future anticipated losses from operations  as we expect to continue to rely on government funding for a significant portion of our revenues for the next few years and  to a lesser extent  interest income 
if we are unable to advance the development of our product candidates through collaborations  or if our current operating capital is not sufficient to fund our operations  we may need to access the capital markets for financing or enter into strategic alliances or licensing arrangements 
if we determine to pursue and are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors will likely experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of 
table of contents our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
off balance sheet obligations we had no off balance sheet obligations other than in connection with our operating leases  which are disclosed in the contractual commitments table above during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows

cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to cash and cash equivalents  which consist of instruments having original maturities of three months or less  and our short term investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes  corporate stock  and corporate bonds 
the securities in our short term investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale  and are subject to minimal interest rate risk  due to their predominantly short term nature 
these securities  classified as available for sale  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
while we do not believe an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations
