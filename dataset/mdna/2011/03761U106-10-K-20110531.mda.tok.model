overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
since then  and through march   we have raised approximately billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive 
table of contents environment for the types of investments we make 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
pursuant to rules adopted in  the sec expanded the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
the sec also adopted an additional rule under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than million 
this rule became effective on july  revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually and while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of our investments may include zero coupon and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
in addition  some of our investments provide for pik interest or dividends 
such amounts of accrued pik interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 
expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by aim 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to investment advisory and management fees  expenses incurred by aim payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  calculation of our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  direct costs and expenses of administration  including independent registered public accounting and legal costs  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  registration and listing fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  taxes  independent directors fees and expenses

we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms 
during periods of asset growth  we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance  interest rate benchmarks  and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods  among other factors 
portfolio and investment activity during our fiscal year ended march   we invested billion across new and existing portfolio companies through a combination of primary and secondary market purchases 
this compares to investing million in new and existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended march  investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled million versus million for the fiscal year ended march  at march   our net portfolio consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus portfolio companies invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants at march  the weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio  subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of march  at our current cost basis were  and  respectively

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain senior secured debt  subordinated debt  and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service 
we utilize mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative 
if and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value 
accordingly  such investments go through our multi step valuation process as described below 
in each case  our independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such level categorized assets 
investments maturing in days or less are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value 
investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our investment adviser  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review our investment adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee 
investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include  as relevant available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal 
table of contents market as the reporting entity and enterprise values  among other factors 
when readily available  broker quotations and or quotations provided by pricing services are considered in the valuation process of independent valuation firms 
for the fiscal year ended march   there has been no change to the company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosure about fair value measurements was released in january and is effective for periods beginning after december   except for separate disclosures for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  as applicable  in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
this update improves financial statement disclosure around transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  around valuation techniques and inputs and around other related disclosures 
transfers between levels  if any  are recognized at the end of the reporting period 
see certain additional disclosures in note to our financial statements 
during the fiscal year ended march   meg energy corp 
common stock was transferred from level to level due to its initial public offering 
there were no other transfers into or out of level  level or level during the periods shown 
revenue recognition the company records interest and dividend income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis 
some of our loans and other investments  including certain preferred equity investments  may have contractual pik interest or dividends 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received 
pik generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
upon capitalization  pik is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments 
for the fiscal year ended march   accrued pik totaled million  on total investment income of million 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discounts are capitalized and we amortize such amounts into income using the interest method or straight line  as applicable 
upon the prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts 
structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned 
investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and or dividends in cash are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest dividend cash payments are past due days or more and or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest dividend cash payments will be collected 
such non accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash  and in management s judgment  are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest or dividend obligations 
interest or dividend cash payments received on non accrual designated investments may be recognized as income or applied 
table of contents to principal depending upon management s judgment 
at the point the company believes pik is not expected to be realized  the pik investment will be placed on non accrual status 
when a pik investment is placed on non accrual status  the accrued  uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through an adjustment to interest or dividend income  respectively 
the company does not reverse previously capitalized pik interest or dividends 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  investment income for the fiscal years ended march   and  gross investment income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the size of the income producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to two factors the reduction in the size of the income producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year and the reduction in average libor of over basis points year over year

the increase in net expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in interest and other debt expenses as we added new sources of capital that increased our weighted average annual interest cost 
the decrease in net expenses from fiscal to was primarily related to the decrease in interest and other debt expenses due to the reduction in average libor in the year over year period coupled with the lower average outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year accrued excise tax expenses totaled  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and

net realized losses incurred during fiscal years and were primarily related to sales and restructurings of certain underperforming portfolio companies such as american safety razor  lvi services and pacific crane maintenance company  various portfolio optimization measures  and our liquidity management strategy during the financial crisis early in the fiscal year 
net realized losses incurred in fiscal were mainly derived from selective exits of underperforming investments 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  cash equivalents and foreign currencies for the fiscal years ended march  and net change in unrealized appreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   net change in unrealized depreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million 
net unrealized appreciation for fiscal and was primarily due to the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation  net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals  and improving capital market conditions 
during fiscal  a material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments 
these lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation  the illiquid capital markets  and the then current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions

the company also has investments in its portfolio that contain pik provisions 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received 
pik generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
in order to maintain the company s status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends  even though the company has not yet collected the cash

more specifically  we may purchase us treasury bills from time to time on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day  settling the sale transaction on a net cash basis with the purchase  subsequent to quarter end 
apollo investment may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions  including drawing down on our facility  as we deem appropriate

table of contents we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company 
with respect to the dividends to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
pursuant to a recent revenue procedure revenue procedure  issued by the irs the revenue procedure  the irs has indicated that it will treat distributions from certain publicly traded rics including bdcs that are paid part in cash and part in stock as dividends that would satisfy the ric s annual distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for federal income tax purposes 
in order to qualify for such treatment  the revenue procedure requires that at least of the total distribution be payable in cash and that each stockholder have a right to elect to receive its entire distribution in cash 
if too many stockholders elect to receive cash  each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a proportionate share of the cash to be distributed although no stockholder electing to receive cash may receive less than of such stockholder s distribution in cash 
this revenue procedure applies to distributions declared on or before december  with respect to taxable years ending on or before december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our us mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
the company also has a revolving credit facility that is based on floating libor rates 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of march   a hypothetical one percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by less than one cent per average share over the next twelve months 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of march   a hypothetical one percent decrease in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our earning by less than one cent per average share over the next twelve months 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
