we rely on a small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us 
a substantial percentage of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a major customer could adversely affect us 
in  our two largest customers  bp and exxonmobil including subsidiaries and joint ventures accounted for approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
our revenues associated with bp are primarily for the construction of the bp owned liberty rig 
our revenues from exxonmobil are primarily for drilling related services 
our ten most significant customers collectively accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues in our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers terminate their contracts with us  fail to renew our existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts to us 
the contract drilling and the rental tools businesses are highly competitive and cyclical  with intense price competition 
the contract drilling and rental tools markets are highly competitive and although we believe no single competitor is dominant  many of our competitors in both the contract drilling and rental tools business may possess greater financial resources than we do 
some of our competitors also are incorporated in countries that may provide them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a us company and which may impair our ability to compete with them for many projects 
contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
many drilling and workover rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity  provided market conditions warrant  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area 
many competitors have constructed numerous rigs during the previous period of high energy prices and  consequently  the number of rigs available in some of the markets in which we operate has exceeded the demand for rigs for extended periods of time  resulting in intense price competition 
most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
historically  the drilling service industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of 
table of contents low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
during periods of decreased demand we typically experience significant reductions in dayrates and utilization 
if we experience reductions in dayrates or if we cannot keep our rigs operating  our financial performance will be adversely impacted 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our rigs if future cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable 
our international operations are also subject to governmental regulation and other risks 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations 
in  we derived approximately percent of our revenues from operations in countries outside the united states 
our international operations are subject to the following risks  among others political  social and economic instability  war  terrorism and civil disturbances  limitations on insurance coverage  such as war risk coverage  in certain areas  expropriation  confiscatory taxation and nationalization of our assets  foreign laws and governmental regulation  including inconsistencies and unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements  and changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations  increases in governmental royalties  import export quotas or trade barriers  hiring and retaining skilled and experienced workers  many of whom are represented by foreign labor unions  work stoppages  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnapping  piracy of vessels transporting our people or equipment  unfavorable changes in foreign monetary and tax policies  solicitation by government officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption  foreign currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  repudiation  nullification  modification or renegotiation of contracts  and other forms of governmental regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control 
we currently have operations in countries 
our operations are subject to interruption  suspension and possible expropriation due to terrorism  war  civil disturbances  political and capital instability and similar events  and we have previously suffered loss of revenue and damage to equipment due to political violence 
recent civil and political disturbances in tunisia  egypt  libya and other north african countries may affect our operations 
we currently have rigs in algeria 
to the extent that algeria experiences similar events  our operations in algeria could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to obtain insurance policies covering risks associated with these types of events  especially political violence coverage  and such policies may only be available with premiums that are not commercially justifiable 
our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of foreign countries whose political  regulatory and judicial systems and regimes may differ significantly from those in the united states 
our ability to compete in international contract drilling markets may be adversely affected by foreign governmental regulations and or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
furthermore  our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to us 

table of contents in addition  tax and other laws and regulations in some foreign countries are not always interpreted consistently among local  regional and national authorities  which often results in good faith disputes between us and governing authorities 
the ultimate outcome of these disputes is never certain  and it is possible that the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
a portion of the workers we employ in our international operations are members of labor unions or otherwise subject to collective bargaining 
we may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled and experienced workers for wages and other benefits that we believe are commercially reasonable 
we may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received or expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not take protective measures against exposure to a foreign currency 
we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
given the international scope of our operations  we are exposed to risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation 
we attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation where possible by obtaining contracts payable in us dollars or freely convertible foreign currency 
in addition  some parties with which we do business could require that all or a portion of our revenues be paid in local currencies 
foreign currency fluctuations therefore could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the shipment of goods  services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations 
our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate 
moreover  many countries  including the us  control the export and re export of certain goods  services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries  persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries  persons and entities 
the laws and regulations concerning import activity  export recordkeeping and reporting  export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing 
these laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime 
moreover  any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions  such as fines  imprisonment  debarment from governmental contracts  seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges 
we are subject to hazards customary for drilling operations  which could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately indemnified or insured 
substantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations  including blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of well control  cratering  oil and natural gas well fires and explosions  natural disasters  pollution and mechanical failure 
our offshore operations also are subject to hazards inherent in marine operations  such as capsizing  sinking  grounding  collision and damage from severe weather conditions 
any of these risks could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment  personal injury and property damage  suspension of operations or environmental damage 
we have had accidents in the past demonstrating some of these hazards 
to the extent that we are unable to insure against these risks or to obtain indemnification agreements to adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards and risks described above  then the occurrence of an event not fully insured or for which we are not indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
in addition  insurance may not continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks 
for example  pollution  reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
even if such insurance is available  insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future  so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive 
for a description of our indemnification obligations and insurance  please read item business insurance and indemnification 
certain areas in and near the gom are subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions 
when operating in the gom  our drilling rigs and rental tools may be located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage or total loss by these storms 
in addition  damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas to 
table of contents our rigs  our shore bases and our corporate infrastructure could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the effects of the damages can be repaired 
the oil and natural gas industry has sustained several catastrophic losses in recent years  including damage from hurricanes in the gom 
as a result  insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and restricted certain insurance coverage such as for losses arising from a named windstorm 
although not a hazard specific to our drilling operations  we could incur significant liability in the event of loss or damage to proprietary data of operators or third parties during our transmission of this valuable data 
government regulations and environmental risks  which reduce our business opportunities and increase our operating costs  might become more stringent in the future 
government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety  environmental protection  pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination 
environmental regulations  in particular  prohibit access to some markets locations and make others less economical  increase equipment and personnel costs  and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault 
in addition  governmental regulations  such as those related to climate change  may discourage our customers activities  reducing demand for our products and services 
we may be liable for damages resulting from pollution of offshore waters and  under united states regulations  must establish financial responsibility in order to drill offshore 
see part i  business  environmental considerations 
regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business 
some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions  in particular emissions from fossil fuels  is attracting increasing attention worldwide 
legislative and regulatory measures to address concerns that emissions of ghgs are contributing to climate change are in various phases of discussions or implementation at the international  national  regional and state levels 
in  the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  which establishes a binding set of emission targets for ghgs  became binding on the countries that had ratified it 
international discussions are underway to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration in in the united states  federal legislation imposing restrictions on ghgs is under consideration 
in addition  the epa is taking steps that would result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the clean air act the caa 
to date  the epa has issued i a mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule  effective december   which establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources in the united states emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions annually  ii an endangerment finding final rule  effective january   which states that current and projected concentrations of six key ghgs in the atmosphere  as well as emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines  threaten public health and welfare  which allowed the epa to finalize motor vehicle ghg standards the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil  and iii a final rule  effective august   to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs 
this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
finally  on november   the epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems  which will be added to the epa s ghg reporting rule 
facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa  with the first report due on march  because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry  existing or future laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could have a negative impact on our business if such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally 
in addition  such laws  regulations  treaties or international 
table of contents agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  which may have a negative impact on our business 
in addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate change legislation or regulations  our business also could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns 
an increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs  impact our ability to conduct our operations and or result in a disruption of our customers operations 
we are regularly involved in litigation  some of which may be material 
we are regularly involved in litigation  claims and disputes incidental to our business  which at times involve claims for significant monetary amounts  some of which would not be covered by insurance 
we undertake all reasonable steps to defend ourselves in such lawsuits 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and any resolution which is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in item of this form k for a discussion of the material legal proceedings affecting us 
we are currently conducting an investigation into possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other laws concerning our international operations 
the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice are conducting parallel investigations into possible fcpa violations 
if we are found to have violated the fcpa or other legal requirements  we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures  which could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
as previously disclosed  we received requests from the united states department of justice doj in july and the united states securities and exchange commission sec in january relating to our utilization of the services of a customs agent 
the doj and the sec are conducting parallel investigations into possible violations of us law by the company  including the fcpa 
in particular  the doj and the sec are investigating our use of customs agents in certain countries in which we currently operate or formerly operated  including kazakhstan and nigeria 
the company is fully cooperating with the doj and sec investigations and is conducting an internal investigation into potential customs and other issues in kazakhstan and nigeria 
the internal investigation identified issues relating to potential non compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including the fcpa with respect to operations in kazakhstan and nigeria 
at this point  we are unable to predict the duration  scope or result of the doj or the sec investigation or whether either agency will commence any legal action 
further  in connection with our internal investigation  we also have learned that an individual who may be considered a foreign official under the fcpa owns in trust a substantial stake in a foreign subcontractor with whom we formerly conducted business through a joint venture relationship in kazakhstan 
the joint venture no longer does business with the foreign subcontractor 
the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations  which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including  but not limited to  injunctive relief  disgorgement  fines  penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs 
these authorities have entered into agreements with  and obtained a range of sanctions against  several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls  whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed 
recent civil and criminal settlements have included multi million dollar fines  deferred prosecution agreements  guilty pleas  and other sanctions  including the requirement that the relevant corporation retain a monitor to oversee its compliance with the fcpa 
in addition  corporations may have to end or modify existing business relationships 
any of these remedial measures  if applicable to us  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents we are subject to laws and regulations concerning our international operations  including export restrictions  us economic sanctions and other activities that we conduct abroad 
we have conducted an internal review concerning our compliance with these legal requirements and have voluntarily disclosed the results of our review to the us government 
if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures  which could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to laws and regulations restricting our international operations  including activities involving restricted countries  organizations  entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us economic sanctions 
pursuant to an internal review  we have identified certain shipments of equipment and supplies that were routed through iran as well as other activities  including drilling activities  which may have violated applicable us laws and regulations 
we have reviewed these shipments  transactions and drilling activities to determine whether the timing  nature and extent of such activities or other conduct may have given rise to violations of these laws and regulations  and we voluntarily disclosed the results of our review to the us government 
at this point  we are unable to predict whether the government will initiate an investigation or any proceedings against us  or the ultimate outcome that may result from our voluntary disclosure 
if us enforcement authorities determine that we were not in compliance with export restrictions  us economic sanctions or other laws and regulations that apply to our international operations  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures  which could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact the demand for rental tools 
hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and gas wells whereby water  sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and  to a lesser extent  oil production 
the epa recently initiated a study to investigate the potential adverse impacts that fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
legislation has also been introduced in the us congress and some states that would require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process 
if enacted  the legislation could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production  which could adversely affect the demand for our rental tools 
risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to various factors and events  most of which are beyond our control  including the following the other risk factors described in this form k  including changes in oil and natural gas prices  a shortfall in rig utilization  operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts estimates of the financial performance of us or our competitors or the financial performance of companies in the oilfield service industry generally  changes in actual or market expectations with respect to the amounts of exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  general conditions in the economy and in energy related industries  general conditions in the securities markets  political instability  terrorism or war  and the outcome of pending and future legal proceedings  investigations  tax assessments and other claims 

table of contents a hostile takeover of our company would be difficult 
some of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it difficult for a hostile suitor to acquire control of our company and to replace our incumbent management 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors and permits the board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock or a new series of preferred stock 
risks related to our debt securities we may not be able to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control 
upon the occurrence of specific change of control events affecting us  the holders of our senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase our notes at percent of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our ability to repurchase our notes upon such a change of control event would be limited by our access to funds at the time of the repurchase and the terms of our other debt agreements 
upon a change of control event  we may be required immediately to repay the outstanding principal  any accrued interest on and any other amounts owed by us under our senior secured credit facilities  our notes and other outstanding indebtedness 
the source of funds for these repayments would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources 
however  we may not have sufficient funds available upon a change of control to make any required repurchases of this outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  the change of control provisions in the indenture governing our senior notes may not protect the holders of our notes from certain important corporate events  such as a leveraged recapitalization which would increase the level of our indebtedness  reorganization  restructuring  merger or other similar transaction  unless such transaction constitutes a change of control under the indenture 
such a transaction may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or  even if it does  may not involve a change that constitutes a change of control as defined in the indenture that would trigger our obligation to repurchase the notes 
therefore  if an event occurs that does not constitute a change of control as defined in the indenture  we will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes and the holders may be required to continue to hold their notes despite the event 
we may not have sufficient cash to repurchase the convertible senior notes at the option of the holder upon a fundamental change or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding notes at percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
in addition  unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation entirely in shares of our common stock  upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of notes converted 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of tendered notes or settlement of converted notes 
additionally  any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the notes may also limit our ability to use borrowings under that credit facility to pay for a repurchase or conversion of the notes and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the notes if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the notes would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof 

table of contents the indenture for our senior notes and our senior secured credit agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to make investments and other restricted payments  including dividends  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  engage in sale leaseback transactions  sell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions 
our senior secured credit agreement also requires us to maintain ratios for consolidated leverage  consolidated interest coverage and consolidated senior secured leverage 
these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default with respect to the related indebtedness 
if a default were to occur  the holders of our senior notes and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
if the repayment of the indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness

despite the decline in e p spending in some of our international drilling markets  we renewed and extended some existing contracts and obtained new contracts as customers turned to us to meet their drilling needs 
our significant achievements of include rental tools segment revenues increased percent in compared to  setting a new record 
rental tools segment gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased percent over utilization in the company s us barge drilling segment nearly doubled to percent in from percent in over percent of all wells drilled in by barge rigs in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico were drilled by parker rigs 
in our international drilling segment  the americas region extended four contracts into we also secured three new contracts in our asia pacific region  one of which mobilized a rig that had been ready stacked since in addition  the contract for rig  the company s caspian sea arctic barge drilling rig  was extended into the parker operated yastreb rig set a new  extended reach drilling record of  feet  nearly eight miles  in total measured depth  operating incident free throughout 
this rig  designed  built and operated by us for exxon neftegas limited  set this record during development drilling of the sakhalin project s odoptu field 
our recent performance and operating results during the fourth quarter have been driven by many of the same factors that have impacted our full year performance 
rental tools segment revenues  segment gross margin and segment gross margin as a percent of revenues set new records 
with facilities strategically located in key us drilling markets and recent timely investments in rental tool inventory  our rental tools business continued to benefit from the continued growth in the development of shale formations and the expanded use of lateral drilling to exploit oil and natural gas resources 
this led to increased demand  higher utilization and improved pricing 
the increase in onshore demand was slightly offset by a decline in us offshore and international revenues 
our us drilling segment revenues  segment gross margin and segment gross margin as a percent of revenues increased  compared to the fourth quarter 
barge drilling in the shallow water and inland areas of the gulf of mexico remained active and we achieved improvements  year to year  in rigs working and dayrates 
international drilling segment revenues  segment gross margin and segment gross margin as a percent of revenues all declined compared to the fourth quarter  primarily due to a reduction in drilling activity in the cis ame region and mexico that resulted in a decline in rig utilization and lower revenues 
this was offset in part by higher revenues from our caspian sea arctic barge rig which returned to a warm stack rate during the fourth quarter of  having been on a lower average dayrate in the prior year s fourth quarter 
though operating costs were reduced as utilization declined  they were unable to keep pace with the decline in revenues 

table of contents project management and engineering services segment revenues increased while segment gross margin and segment gross margin as a percent of revenues declined 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher operating rates on the yastreb rig and orlan platform and increased engineering services revenues 
the segment s gross margin decline is primarily attributable to lower earnings on the fourth quarter s engineering revenues compared with those of the prior year s comparable period 
construction contract revenues and earnings declined compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  representative of the work completed during each period on the customer owned liberty rig 
outlook growing demand and improving pricing in our us markets for rental tools and barge drilling were sources of revenue and gross margin increases in our project management business provided relatively steady results while international drilling activity experienced a decline in e p spending in many of the markets we serve 
looking ahead  we believe the rental tools business should continue to benefit from continued growth in us drilling activity in the oil and liquid rich shale plays 
we expect to make further investments in this business which should contribute to our growth potential 
we expect our gulf of mexico barge drilling business will continue to improve fleet utilization and will realize higher average dayrates in low finding costs for oil and gas and an established and manageable regulatory environment should support continued interest among operators to drill in this market 
international e p spending is predicted by many industry forecasters to increase in should this occur  we would expect it to impact our business later in the year 
the portfolio of the project management and engineering services segment is expected to continue to generate steady revenues and earnings related to the current projects we are managing  with the addition of incremental revenues and earnings during the year from the yastreb rig move project 
capital expenditures in  funded primarily through operating cash flows and use of revolving credit facilities  are projected to be approximately million to million  including approximately to million for rig fleet maintenance projects and rental tool investments 
major project spending is expected to include construction and delivery of the two newbuild  company owned  drill rigs for alaska

international drilling segment international drilling segment revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared with december  the largest decline occurred in the cis ame region as a result of lower average fleet utilization for our operations throughout this region as spending on drilling programs continued to be adversely impacted by weaker financial conditions and reduced spending on state involved e p programs 
in addition  our caspian sea arctic barge  located in the cis ame region  was on reduced dayrates  including a zero dayrate for a period during  as it underwent a planned refurbishment and upgrade project and a parker initiated repair program before ending the year on reduced day rates while our customer completed necessary permitting processes 
revenues in our americas region declined million to million primarily due to lower average fleet utilization and lower average dayrates in mexico due to the completion of a contract in for rig b and the release of two rigs in northern mexico during additionally  in the second quarter of  we recognized a demobilization fee  which was not repeated in this was offset by increased revenues from our operations in colombia  a result of growing activity in this market that led to higher utilization for our rigs 
in our asia pacific region  revenues decreased million in to million compared to due mainly to lower utilization of our rigs in new zealand 
this was partially offset by increased revenues in indonesia and papua new guinea as we increased the number of rigs working and earned higher dayrates 
the international drilling segment operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million to million during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   with decreases in each of our three geographic regions 
the largest decrease occurred in the cis ame region and is attributable to the overall lower revenues as well as increased expenses of the planned repair  refurbishment  and upgrade project for our caspian sea arctic barge 
the decrease in the americas region is primarily due to the lower revenues and extended rig move costs and higher labor and fuel costs in colombia 
a decrease in the asia pacific region was due to lower overall revenues  a lower realized gross margin on the most recent contract award due to start up costs  and the receipt in of a rig demobilization fee  not repeated in us drilling segment us drilling segment revenues increased percent  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the revenue increase was attributable to a 
table of contents recovering market  which has led to improved utilization for our barge drilling rig fleet 
utilization for our us barge drilling rig fleet increased to percent for from percent for and was partially offset by a decline in average dayrates of approximately percent due to a barge rig finishing a term contract at substantially higher rates to approximately  per day in from approximately  per day in the us drilling segment operating gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of primarily as a result of the improved market and operating conditions and continued cost management 
rental tools segment rental tools segment revenues increased million  or percent to million during the year ended december  as compared with the revenue increase is attributable to an increase in utilization resulting from improved market conditions  timely investments in rental tool inventory  and reduced customer discounting during the period compared with the same period during the expanded use of horizontal drilling to exploit both shale deposits and conventional oil and gas reservoirs and longer well bores have led to greater market demand for rental tools 
with its facilities strategically located in the major centers of drilling in the us  our rental tools business has benefited from servicing this growing demand 
the increased revenues from domestic land markets was somewhat offset by a moderate decline in revenues to gom offshore customers and the international offshore market in compared with the decline in revenues from gom customers is due to the cessation and slow restart of drilling in that market following the macondo well blowout in april the decline in international revenues for this segment was due to fewer placements of rental tools for offshore applications 
the rental tools segment operating gross margins  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or percent to million for as compared with as a result of the increase in revenues described above and reduced discounting in compared with project management and engineering services segment revenues for this segment increased million during as compared with this increase was primarily the result of higher revenues related to our arkutun dagi project  increased revenues from our bp liberty o m contract and higher revenues in orlan where we experienced higher dayrates offset by lower reimbursable revenues 
the increases in revenue were offset by decreases in revenue for our operations on the yastreb rig in sakhalin island and in kuwait due to lower reimbursable revenues 
for our sakhalin operations  during we earned a fixed fee during the rig move  upgrade and customer modification phase of the contract  which was not repeated in project management and engineering services do not incur depreciation and amortization  and as such  gross margin for this segment decreased million in compared with gross margin primarily due to increased operating expenses in sakhalin 
revenues from the construction contract segment decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the liberty rig project is accounted for on a percentage of completion basis with revenues and earnings recognized based on progress made relative to estimated total project costs 
the decline in reported revenues reflects reduced work effort as the construction transitioned to rig up labor from major construction in the construction contract segment does not incur depreciation and amortization  and as such  gross margin recognized during was million compared with million in the margin reduction is due to the increase in total estimated construction costs over a longer construction phase

these decreases were slightly offset by an increase in professional fees related to consulting services 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense for is primarily related to the unfavorable ruling by the atyrau oblast court to uphold the lower court decision and allow the revised tax notification to stand as discussed in note  kazakhstan ministry of finance tax audit  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents the significant terms of the convertible notes are as follows notes conversion feature the initial conversion price for note holders to convert their notes into shares is at a common stock share price equivalent of shares of common stock per  note value 
conversion rate adjustments occur for any issuances of stock  warrants  rights or options except for stock purchase plans or dividend re investments or any other transfer of benefit to substantially all stockholders  or as a result of a tender or exchange offer 
the company may  under advice of our board of directors  increase the conversion rate at our sole discretion for a period of at least days 
notes settlement feature upon tender of the notes for conversion  we can either settle entirely in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  solely at our option 
our intent is to satisfy conversion obligation for our notes in cash  rather than in common stock  for at least the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
this reduces the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include any possible conversion premium  which would be the difference between the average price of our shares and the conversion price per share of common stock 
contingent conversion feature note holders may only convert notes when either sales price or trading price conditions are met  on or after the notes due date or upon certain accounting changes or certain corporate transactions fundamental changes involving stock distributions 
make whole provisions are only included in the accounting and fundamental change conversions such that holders do not lose value as a result of the changes 
settlement feature upon conversion  we will pay either cash or provide shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion rate multiplied by a volume weighted average price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date 
conversions can be settled in cash or shares  solely at our discretion 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge note hedge and sold warrants in private transactions with counterparties that were different than the ultimate holders of the notes 
the note hedge included purchasing free standing call options and selling free standing warrants  both exercisable in our common shares 
the note hedge allows us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties to the transaction equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and or pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
the terms of the call options mirror the notes major terms whereby the call option strike price is the same as the initial conversion price as are the number of shares callable  per share and  shares  respectively 
this feature prevents dilution of our outstanding shares 
the warrants allow us to sell  common shares at a strike price of per share 
the conversion price of the notes remains at per share  and the existence of the call options and warrants serve to guard against dilution at share prices less than per share  since we would be able to satisfy our obligations and deliver shares upon conversion of the notes with shares that are obtained by exercising the call options 
we paid a premium of approximately million for the call options  and received proceeds for a premium of approximately million for the sale of the warrants 
this reduced the net cost of the note hedge to million 
the expiration date of the note hedge is the earlier of the last day on which the notes remain outstanding and the maturity date of the notes 
the notes are classified as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
because we have the choice of settling the call options and the warrants in cash or shares of our common stock and these contracts meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification  the cost of the call options and proceeds from the sale of the warrants are classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  because both of these contracts are classified in stockholders equity and are solely indexed to our own common stock  they are not accounted for as derivatives 
debt issuance costs related to the notes totaled approximately million and are being amortized over the five year term of the notes using the effective interest method

liberty project status in november  bp informed us that it was suspending construction on the liberty extended reach drilling rig project to review the rig s engineering and design  including its safety systems 
we commenced construction of this rig for bp in april pursuant to an epci contract 
in august  bp also awarded us an o m contract for the first phase of drilling on the liberty field  which is expected to be a two year project to drill an ultra extended reach well  nearly two miles deep and as far as eight miles from the pad 
bp has not announced a schedule for resuming construction on the rig or new target dates for drilling and production start up 
the liberty rig construction contract is a fixed fee and reimbursable contract accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
costs on the project are reimbursed without markup  except for costs associated with changes in work scope  for which we are entitled to a markup 
as of december   we had recognized million in project to date revenues and million in margin of the million fixed fee portion of the contract 
the liberty rig construction contract expired on february  prior to expiration of the construction contract  bp indentified several areas of concern for which it asked us to provide explanations and documentation  and we have done so 
although we believe that the issues raised by bp have been adequately addressed  there can be no assurance of when or how these issues will be resolved with our client 
at this point  construction on the rig is incomplete  and it cannot be completed until bp determines to resume construction 
the company and bp have continued activities to preserve and maintain the rig under the pre operations phase of our o m contract 
the o m contract is scheduled to expire on may   and there can be no assurance that it will be extended 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net realizable value exceeds our net carrying value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 

table of contents asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
as a result of certain impairment indicators  primarily the depressed international market  we tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december   noting our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows support the current carrying values of our assets 
therefore  we did not recognize any impairment of our property  plant  and equipment as of december  insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability and health benefits claims 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 

table of contents our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our net operating loss nol carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and  in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we provide for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
we apply the amendments to accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
this accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately anticipate actual outcome 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
construction contract revenues and costs are recognized on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the cost to cost method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
there are a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  including customer contract payment terms and the possible use of foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars  which is our functional currency  and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
due to various factors  including customer acceptance  local banking laws  other statutory requirements  local currency convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs  actual foreign currency exchange rate risk needs may vary from those anticipated in the customer contracts  resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in foreign currencies typically have not had a material impact on our overall results 
in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency requirements  foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments  specifically foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contracts  or spot purchases  may be used to mitigate foreign exchange rate currency risk 
a foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we had no open foreign currency exchange rate risk or interest rate derivative contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where 
table of contents applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of senior notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible senior notes due was million on december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million for the senior notes and million for the convertible senior notes
