item business overview we are a biomedical products company focused on commercializing the intercept blood system  or intercept system  to enhance blood safety 
the intercept system is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated blood components intended for transfusion 

table of contents we have worldwide commercialization rights for the intercept blood system for platelets  plasma and red blood cells and we currently market and sell the intercept system for both platelets and plasma in a number of countries in europe  the commonwealth of independent states  or cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world using our direct sales force or through distributors 
the intercept platelet and plasma systems have both received ce mark approval 
we continue to prioritize commercialization of the intercept blood system for platelets and plasma in these countries and regions 
in addition  we plan to continue development of our intercept red blood cell system 
subject to the availability of adequate funding we also plan to pursue regulatory approval of the intercept platelet and plasma systems in the united states 
we were incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in information regarding our revenue  net income or losses  and total assets for the last three fiscal years can be found in the financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  was formed in the netherlands in product development background the intercept blood system is designed to broadly target and inactivate blood borne pathogens  such as viruses for example  hiv  west nile  sars  hepatitis b and c  bacteria and parasites  as well as potentially harmful white blood cells  while preserving the therapeutic properties of platelet  plasma and red blood cell transfusion products 
the intercept blood system inactivates a broad array of pathogens and has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion related transmission of pathogens for which testing is not completely effective or is not currently performed 
we believe that the intercept blood system also has the potential to inactivate most new pathogens before they are identified and before tests are developed and adopted commercially to detect their presence in donated blood 
in addition  data from commercial use suggests that treating platelet components with the intercept platelet system substantially reduces the rate of transfusion related adverse events as compared to the incidence of such events prior to adoption of the intercept platelet system 
the intercept blood system is based on our proprietary technology for controlling biological replication 

table of contents products  product candidates and development activities the following table identifies our products and product development programs and their current status product or product under development product or development status commercial rights intercept blood system platelets commercialized in a number of countries in europe  the cis  and the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world united states phase iii clinical trial completed  seeking fda concurrence on additional phase iii clinical trial worldwide intercept blood system plasma commercialized in a number of countries in europe  the cis countries  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world united states orphan drug designation for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp  phase iii clinical trials completed  seeking concurrence of clinical adequacy with fda worldwide intercept blood system red blood cells phase i clinical trial completed in  preparing for initiation of phase iii clinical trial for patients requiring acute transfusion support worldwide intercept blood system for platelets the intercept blood system for platelets  or platelet system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in platelets donated for transfusion 
the platelet system has received ce mark approval in the european union and is being marketed and sold in several countries in a number of countries in europe  the cis  and the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
separate approvals for use of intercept treated platelet products have been obtained in france and switzerland 
in germany and austria  where approvals must be obtained by individual blood centers for use of intercept treated platelets  several centers have obtained such approvals 
many countries outside of europe accept the ce mark  and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes before the platelet system can be made commercially available 
in general  these processes do not require additional clinical trials 
in addition to regulatory approvals  some potential customers  including the largest branch of the german red cross  desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the platelet system 
we also expect the japanese red cross to conduct a clinical study before adoption of any pathogen inactivation system 
in the united states  we will not be able to market the platelet system until we have conducted an additional phase iii clinical trial 
we are currently working with the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to establish a protocol for such a trial 
however  we have no plans to initiate such a clinical trial unless adequate funding is secured 

table of contents additional information regarding our interactions with the fda and possible clinical trial design can be found under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  under the risk factor titled our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
information regarding our revenues from the platelet system for the years ended december    and can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
intercept blood system for plasma the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in plasma donated for transfusion 
the plasma system has received ce mark approval in a number of countries in europe and is marketed and sold in several countries in europe and in the cis 
france  switzerland  germany  and austria require separate approvals for use of intercept treated plasma products 
intercept treated plasma approvals have been obtained in these countries with the exception of austria 
many countries outside of europe accept the ce mark  and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes before the platelet system can be made commercially available 
in general  these processes do not require additional clinical trials 
in addition to regulatory approvals  some potential customers may desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the plasma system 
in the united states  we have received orphan drug status for intercept treated plasma for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  or ttp  although we will not be able to market the plasma system until we have submitted and obtained fda approval of a product marketing application based upon our completed phase iii clinical trials and  if required  additional phase iii clinical trials 
we do not know if the fda will require any additional studies 
information regarding our revenues from the plasma system for the years ended december   and can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
intercept blood system for red blood cells the intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in red blood cells donated for transfusion 
in  we completed a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with the red blood cell system 
we completed a phase i clinical trial of the red blood cell system in  meeting the clinical trial s primary end point 
we expect to spend the majority of implementing and verifying changes to the red blood cell system  manufacturing clinical supplies  and completing site set up activities before we enter phase iii clinical trials 
previously  we terminated phase iii clinical trials for acute and chronic anemia for a prior generation of the red blood cell system 
the trials were terminated due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red blood cells in two patients in the study for chronic anemia 
the antibody eventually cleared and the patients had no adverse health consequences 
after unblinding the data from the original phase iii clinical trials  we found that we had met the primary end point in the clinical trial for acute anemia 
prior to commencing the phase i clinical trial in  we evaluated the antibodies detected in the original phase iii clinical trials and 
table of contents developed process changes to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
there were no adverse events associated with intercept treated red blood cells evident in the trial 
based on the results from the clinical trial  we plan to enter our new phase iii trials with the modified process 
intercept blood system technology our platelet system and plasma system employ the same technology 
platelet components or plasma components collected from blood donors are transferred into plastic intercept disposable kits in which they are mixed with a proprietary cerus compound  amotosalen  which has an affinity for nucleic acid 
the disposable kits are then placed in an illumination device  or illuminator  where the mixture is exposed to ultra violet a uva light 
if pathogens such as viruses  bacteria or parasites are present in the platelet or plasma components  the energy from the uva light causes the amotosalen to bond with the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the ability of amotosalen to form both cross links between strands of nucleic acid and links to single nucleic acid strands results in a strong chemical bond between the amotosalen and the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the presence of these bonds is designed to prevent replication of the nucleic acid within pathogens  effectively inactivating the pathogens 
a high level of inactivation has been demonstrated in a broad range of pathogens studied by cerus and others in laboratory testing 
for instance  intercept has demonstrated inactivation of a number of single stranded nucleic acid based viruses such as hiv  hepatitis b  hepatitis c using a model virus  west nile  chikungunya  and certain influenza viruses 
since platelets and plasma do not rely on nucleic acid for therapeutic efficacy  the intercept blood system is designed to preserve the therapeutic function of the platelet and plasma components when used in human transfusions 
following the inactivation process  residual amotosalen and by products are reduced by more than through use of a compound adsorption device  which is an integrated component of the disposable kit 
we have performed extensive toxicology testing on the residual amotosalen and its by products and good safety margins have been demonstrated 
any remaining amotosalen which may be transfused is rapidly excreted by humans 
leukocytes  also known as white blood cells  are typically present in platelet and plasma components collected for transfusion  and can cause adverse transfusion reactions as well as an often fatal disease called graft versus host disease 
leukocytes  like pathogens  rely on nucleic acid for replication and cellular function 
the intercept blood system  with its combination of the amotosalen and uva light  is designed to inactivate leukocytes in the same manner it inactivates pathogens 
like the platelet and plasma systems  the red blood cell system acts by using an additive compound to form bonds with nucleic acid in pathogens that may be present in red blood cell components destined for transfusion 
the red blood cell system is designed to preserve the therapeutic qualities of the red blood cells  which do not rely on nucleic acid for their cellular function 
the red blood cell system uses a proprietary cerus compound  s unlike the platelet and plasma systems  the chemical bonds from s are not triggered by uva light  but instead by the ph level of the red blood cell components 
after mixture with the red blood cell components in plastic disposable kits  s is designed to rapidly break down into a form that is no longer chemically reactive with nucleic acid 
as with the platelet and plasma systems  a high level of inactivation in a broad range of pathogens has been demonstrated with the red blood cell system 
by treating blood components with intercept within a day of collection  the inactivation of bacteria prevents bacterial growth that could create increased risk of inflammatory response or dangerous levels of endotoxins 
extensive clinical testing has been done on platelet and plasma products treated with the intercept blood system  as well as post marketing haemovigilance studies of the treated blood products in routine use 

table of contents we believe that  due to their mechanisms of action  the platelet system  plasma system  and red blood cell system will potentially inactivate blood borne pathogens that have not yet been tested with our systems  including emerging and future threats to the blood supply 
we do not claim  however  that our system will inactivate all pathogens  including prions  and our inactivation claims are limited to those contained in our product specifications 
collaborations baxter and fenwal we collaborated with baxter international  inc  or baxter  on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in we obtained worldwide commercialization rights to the red blood cell system from baxter in february effective february   we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where the commercialization rights had been licensed to bioone corporation  or bioone 
we agreed to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of product sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company  fenwal  inc  or fenwal 
fenwal has assumed baxter s rights and obligations under our agreements 
bioone in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone was responsible for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing  the platelet system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
under that agreement  bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
in  baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal 
we received a total of million in up front payments under the terms of the agreement 
in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone for commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone was responsible for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing the plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
in  baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal 
we received a total of million in cash as well as equity securities in bioone valued at million at the time of issuance in connection with the agreement 
at december   we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in bioone using a variety of criteria 
these criteria included  but were not limited to third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of bioone and available financial information 
as a result of that analysis  we recorded a complete impairment of the carrying value of our equity interest in bioone at december  in august  we completed an acquisition of certain assets of bioone  including the commercialization rights that baxter later fenwal and we had granted to bioone for both the platelet and plasma systems 
concurrently  fenwal and we terminated the commercialization rights 
as a consequence of the termination  and pursuant to a pre existing agreement with fenwal  our commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems under our and agreements with baxter became worldwide 
as consideration for the acquired bioone assets  at the closing of the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to bioone and relinquished all of the shares we previously held in bioone 
in addition  six months from the closing date of the acquisition  we issued an additional  shares of our stock to bioone 
accordingly  at december   we had recorded the fair value of the assets acquired  consisting of commercialization rights of million  illuminators of million and recorded goodwill for million  which represents the buyer specific value derived by cerus as a result of having global commercialization rights for platelets and plasma 

table of contents united states armed forces in february  we were awarded million under a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense  or dod 
since then  we have been awarded an aggregate of million under awards and cooperative agreements with the dod  all of which were for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the cooperative agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in red blood cell units  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of concern to the united states armed forces 
settlement agreement with baxter during the fourth quarter of  we and baxter resolved several outstanding issues and disputes resulting from the transition services agreement and manufacturing agreement 
as an outcome of those negotiations  on december   we and baxter entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement  or the mrsa 
the mrsa called for the complete and permanent waiver and release of any and all claims we or baxter had on any amounts generated under the transition services agreement 
as a result of entering into the mrsa  we eliminated approximately million in payment obligations to baxter and million in receivables due from baxter which were generated under the agreements and recorded on our balance sheet 
the mrsa required us to pay million to baxter for the settlement 
as such  we recorded a million gain during the year ended december   and a million obligation on our december  balance sheet 
we paid the million payment in satisfaction of the mrsa in january  investment in aduro biotech in november  we announced that we had sold certain assets that made up our former immunotherapy business to a newly formed independent company  anza therapeutics  inc  or anza  financed by venture capital firms 
in exchange for our contribution of tangible and intangible assets to anza  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
however  due to the early clinical and pre clinical stages of anza s technology and relatively high risk of failure for such technologies  we determined that it would be unlikely that we would be able to derive any value from our equity interest in anza and as such  we did not assign a value on our balance sheet to the equity interest we held in anza 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
in july  we entered into a three way license agreement with anza and aduro biotech  or aduro  and separate agreements with each of anza and aduro collectively  the assignment agreements 
in november  anza transferred all of its intellectual property to aduro pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreements 
in addition  for agreeing to the transfer and surrendering our ownership in anza  we received preferred stock representing a equity interest in aduro  a royalty on all future product sales that aduro may recognize in the future from the transferred technology  and million in cash from aduro 
furthermore  we received cash of approximately million from anza 
as a result of entering into the assignment agreements  we no longer hold any equity in anza 
we believe that aduro s technology platforms  which are largely based on anza s in process development programs  have a high risk of failure and we have no basis to believe that we will receive economic benefit from our equity ownership in aduro 
as such  we have not assigned any value to our equity ownership in aduro 
william greenman  our senior vice president and chief business officer  is on the board of directors of aduro 
mr 
greenman does not represent cerus on aduro s board of directors 
manufacturing and supply we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the devices  disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the intercept blood system for use in clinical trials and for 
table of contents commercialization 
we currently do not have alternate manufacturers for the components in our products beyond those that we currently rely on 
we rely solely on fenwal for the manufacture of intercept blood system disposable kits and on contract manufacturers for the production of inactivation compounds  compound adsorption components of the disposable kits and uva illumination devices used in the intercept blood system 
in  we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal 
under the amended agreement  fenwal is obligated to sell  and we are obligated to purchase  finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for both clinical and commercial use 
the agreement permits us to purchase platelet and plasma kits from third party manufacturers provided that we meet certain annual minimum purchase obligations to fenwal 
we are responsible for developing and delivering to fenwal our proprietary inactivation compounds and adsorption media for incorporation into the final system configuration 
the term of the fenwal agreement extends through december   and is automatically renewed for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon thirty months prior written notice  in the case of fenwal  or twenty four months prior written notice  in our case 
we and fenwal each have normal and customary termination rights  including termination for material breach 
we are responsible for the full management and control of the supply chain for the intercept illuminator devices and certain other components of the platelet and plasma kits 
in anticipation of this obligation  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with nova biomedical corporation  or nova  september  nova has manufactured illuminators for us in the past 
the term of the nova agreement extends through september and is automatically renewable for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon twelve months prior written notice 
we have contracted with one manufacturing facility for the synthesis of amotosalen  the inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this contract  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up to  for such year 
in the past  we have incurred these penalties 
we and our contract manufacturers  including fenwal and nova  purchase certain raw materials for our disposable kits  inactivation compounds  materials and parts associated with compound adsorption devices and uva illumination devices from a limited number of suppliers 
some of our suppliers require minimum annual purchase amounts 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  parts and devices  we have not validated or qualified any alternate manufacturers 
as such  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  parts and devices  if required  will likely not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs and potential regulatory reviews 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations in the united states  western europe  the cis countries  the middle east  and japan  where various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in germany  france  and england 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allows us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelets and plasma components treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  several blood centers in germany have received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system and certain other for the plasma system 
in france  broad product adoption is dependent on a central decision by the etablissement francais du sang  or efs  and then on a broad based national supply contract being awarded 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service  and we understand that the national blood service has decided to implement bacterial detection before considering pathogen inactivation 

table of contents our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelet and plasma treated with the intercept system have been agreed upon between the french ministry of health and the efs  however  a robust budget for adopting pathogen inactivation technologies must be established before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the platelet and plasma systems in france 
we maintain a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  headquartered in the netherlands  which focuses its efforts on marketing and selling the intercept blood system in a number of countries in europe  the cis  and the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we also have a small scientific affairs group in the united states and the netherlands that supports the commercialization efforts 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
certain competing products currently on the market  such as solvent detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center 
caridianbct  or caridian  has received a ce mark for a pathogen inactivation system for the treatment of platelets and plasma in blood centers 
other competitors  such as octapharma ag and macopharma international are marketing pathogen inactivation products or systems for treating donated plasma in europe 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
some of these indirect competitors have mature  well established products and more resources than we have 
further discussion of the major competitors to our blood product business can be found in the risk factor entitled if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials or in commercial settings  we may face additional clinical  regulatory  and commercial challenges 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen inactivation technology  robustness of treated blood components upon transfusion  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value relative to perceived risk  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  we believe the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes and customer demand through the development and introduction of new products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents related to the intercept blood 
table of contents system 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire at various dates between and proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
seasonality our business is dependent on the marketing and commercialization of the intercept blood system to customers such as blood banks  hospitals  distributors and other health care providers that have a need for a pathogen inactivation system to treat blood products for transfusion 
since our customer s needs are not based on seasonal trends  seasonality does not have a material effect on our business 
inventory requirements and product return rights our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our balance sheet  can take over one year for production to be complete before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform such analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory using a number of factors  including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
we sell the intercept blood system directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  and government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective product 
customers at december   we had three customers that each accounted for more than of our outstanding trade receivables and collectively accounted for approximately of our outstanding trade receivables 
in addition  four customers  each accounting for more than of our product sales  cumulatively represented of our product revenue for the year ended december  the loss of any one of these customers would have an adverse impact on our business 
to date  we have not experienced collection difficulties from these customers 
see note of item a financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional details about these customers 
research and development expenses a significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development 
we have incurred total research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note of item a financial statements of this annual report on form k for costs and expenses related to research and development  and other financial information for fiscal years  and 
table of contents government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 
our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or the mdd  of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
the intercept blood system for platelets received the ce mark in october the intercept blood system for plasma received the ce mark in november a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union and in other countries recognizing the ce mark 
in addition  france  switzerland  germany  and austria have separate approval processes for use of the intercept treated products 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pre market approval application  or pma  include preclinical laboratory and animal tests submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  appropriate tests to show the product s safety  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  submission to the fda of a pma  and fda review of the pma in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
the fda will require a pma for each of the intercept systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells because the fda considers the intercept blood system a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
however  before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our pma to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
should the fda ask questions to bpac  we expect bpac will answer those questions and make recommendations to the fda 
in order to support our pma for the intercept blood system  we have conducted various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
since assuming responsibility for regulatory approval of the intercept blood system in the united states in  we have used the same modular process for our pma application for the platelet system that baxter had used in the united states 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and a supplemental analysis of data from this trial in we submitted this information along with several other modules of our pma  to the fda 
the fda has indicated that the clinical trial data and supplemental analysis 
table of contents are not sufficient to support a pma and we have had several interactions with the fda subsequent to the clinical trial 
in november  we presented a plan for a proposed phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the bpac 
the outcome of that meeting was the support for the design and endpoints of a clinical trial for intercept treated platelets  subject to changes regarding the sensitivity of the safety endpoint 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding further details of the proposed additional phase iii clinical trial 
we plan to initiate such a trial only if adequate funding can be secured 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than europe 
intercept treated plasma was recently granted orphan drug status for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
although we have completed clinical trials in this patient population  the fda may require us to complete additional clinical trials before approval would be granted 
if additional clinical trials are required for approval  we will likely only initiate such trials if adequate funding can be secured 
the fda inspects the facilities at which products are manufactured and will not permit clinical studies with a product or approve a product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
the facilities of the principal third party suppliers that manufacture our products are not currently fda qualified 
in addition to regulating our blood safety products  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products that they prepare using the intercept blood system 
if our products were to be approved by the fda  us based blood centers will be required to obtain site specific licenses prior to engaging in interstate transport of blood components processed using the intercept blood system 
any delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and effective  regulatory authorities have taken  and are expected to take  into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system 
data from human clinical studies must demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components 
in addition  regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data only from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consist of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
the intercept blood system for red blood cells preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
we plan to perform a clinical trial utilizing an intended commercial configuration 
further discussion of our regulatory and clinical trial status can be found in the risk factor entitled our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue in that country 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 

table of contents health care reimbursement and reform our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained 
the recent us healthcare reform act and ongoing cost saving efforts may have an impact on our ability to profitably commercialize intercept in the united states and elsewhere 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general  and administrative activities 
of the employees engaged in selling  general  and administrative activities  were employed by our european subsidiary  cerus europe bv none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

risk factors risk factors our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business may suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
there may be additional risks faced by our business 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the intercept blood system may not achieve broad market acceptance 
we may encounter governmental and transfusion medicine community resistance to commercial adoption for any or all of our products 
in addition to our customers  we must also address issues and concerns from broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system  from patients  to transfusing physicians  hospitals  private and public sector payors  regulatory bodies and public health authorities 
we may be unable to demonstrate to these constituencies that the intercept blood system is safe  effective and economical  or that the benefits of using the intercept blood system products justify their cost 
use of the platelet system results in some processing loss of platelets 
if the loss of platelets leads to increased costs for our customers  our customers or prospective customers believe that the loss of platelet reduces the efficacy of the transfusion unit  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  prospective customers may not adopt our platelet system 
certain studies have indicated that transfusion of conventionally prepared platelets may yield higher post transfusion platelet counts according to a measurement 
table of contents called corrected count increment and may be more effective than transfusion of intercept treated platelets 
while studies also demonstrate that intercept treated platelets retain therapeutic function comparable to conventional platelets  customers may choose not to adopt our platelet system due to considerations relating to corrected count increment or efficacy 
our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens may limit their acceptance 
for example  due to the biology of certain non lipid enveloped viruses  including the hepatitis a virus  our products have not been demonstrated to inactivate these viruses 
in addition  for human parvovirus b  which is also a non lipid enveloped virus  our testing has not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
although we have shown high levels of inactivation of a broad spectrum of lipid enveloped viruses  some customers may choose not to adopt our products based on considerations concerning inability to inactivate  or limited inactivation  of certain non lipid enveloped viruses 
similarly  although our product has been demonstrated to effectively inactivate spore forming bacteria  our products have not been shown to be effective in inactivating bacterial spores  once formed 
in addition  since prions do not contain nucleic acid  our products do not inactivate prions 
while transmission of prions has not been a major problem in blood transfusions  and we are not aware of any competing products that inactivate prions  the inability to inactivate prions may limit market acceptance of our products 
we have conducted pre clinical and clinical studies of our products in both in vivo and in vitro environments using well established tests that are accepted by regulatory bodies 
when an in vitro test was not generally available or not well established  we conducted in vivo studies in mammalian models to predict human responses 
although we have no reason to believe that the in vitro and in vivo studies are not predictive of actual results in humans  we cannot be certain that the results of these in vitro and in vivo studies accurately predict the actual results in humans in all cases 
to the extent that actual results in human patients differs from the results of our in vitro or in vivo testing  market acceptance of our products may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  due to limitations of detective tests  we cannot exclude that a sufficient quantity of pathogen or pathogens may still be present in active form which could present a risk of infection to the transfused patient 
such uncertainty may limit the market acceptance of our products 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
in addition  there is a risk that further studies we or others may conduct will show results inconsistent with previous studies 
should this happen  potential customers may delay or choose not to adopt our products  and existing customers may cease use of our products 
market acceptance of our products is affected by blood center budgets and the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  and other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the intercept blood system  its hospital customers may not accept  or may not have the budget to purchase  intercept treated blood products 
since blood centers would likely not eliminate the practice of screening donors or testing blood for pathogens prior to transfusion  even after implementing our products  some blood centers may not be able to identify enough cost offsets to afford to purchase our products 
budgetary concerns may be further exacerbated by the economic austerity programs implemented in european countries  which may limit the adoption of new technologies  including our products 
furthermore  it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical device products 
in certain countries  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
the recently enacted health care reform laws in the united states and proposed restructuring of the medicare and medicaid systems have also placed downward pressure on the pricing of medical products 

table of contents product adoption in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have food and drug administration  or fda  approval for any of our products 
in addition  if we do not achieve widespread product adoption in key european countries  adoption in other countries may be affected 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to effectively market  promote  distribute  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly delay or even diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in germany  france  and england 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are expected to be on a regional or even blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local approvals and centralized regulatory approvals from the paul ehrlich institute  or pei 
product characteristics relating to platelet dose of intercept treated platelets that have received marketing authorization from the pei may be incompatible with market requirements 
some potential customers may await further safety information or additional studies before choosing whether to adopt our products 
customers or prospective customers may conduct and complete their own clinical trials before adopting our products 
for instance  we have been informed by the largest group of blood centers in germany that it will complete a clinical trial before purchasing our products on a routine basis 
we cannot predict the final trial design  number of transfusions  enrollment duration  estimated time it will take to complete such a trial  or trial outcome 
while intercept treated platelets and plasma have received in country regulatory approval and reimbursement rates have been established in france  adoption throughout france has been limited to certain blood centers 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service and we understand that the national blood service has decided to implement bacterial detection testing before considering pathogen inactivation 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures in japan 
the japanese red cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen inactivation of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt any pathogen inactivation approach 
before the japanese red cross considers our products  we understand that we may need to commit to making certain product configuration changes in order to allow the intercept blood system to integrate with the collection platforms of the japanese red cross 
our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue in that country 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
our products  both those sold commercially and those under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  sales and distribution  
table of contents use standards and documentation  post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
our products are in various stages of development and regulatory approval  and we face the risks of failure inherent in developing medical devices and biotechnology products based on new technologies 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
for our product candidates  we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years 
we may continue to encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
clinical trials are particularly expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
we do not know whether we will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
criteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials and products emerging from any successful trial may not reach the market for several years 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
for instance  clinical trials previously conducted using intercept treated plasma for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura lasted approximately four years due in part  to the difficulties associated with enrolling qualified patients 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into clinical trials on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 
outside the united states  regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in addition to ce mark documentation  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation 
in may  we obtained a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our platelet system and will need to obtain an extension every five years 
we or our customers may also be required 
table of contents to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the ce mark as being adequate for commercializing the intercept blood system in those countries 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but may be expensive or take a long time to complete 
in addition  regulatory agencies are able to withdraw or suspend previously issued approvals 
we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to discrepancies in safety results 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms and had shown statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
we understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the fda s questions 
in november  we and the fda presented a proposed clinical trial protocol for a second phase iii clinical trial to the fda s blood product advisory committee  or bpac 
although the bpac agreed with the proposed trial design  safety endpoints and efficacy endpoints  we believe we will need to reach agreement with the fda on the means necessary to satisfy the bpac s request for more stringent safety margins than we had proposed 
in order to meet the more stringent safety margins  we may need to enroll and collect data from more patients than what we had initially proposed to bpac 
until the final study size and design requirements are determined  we will not be able to assess the feasibility of a second phase iii trial 
the dimensions of such a phase iii trial may be prohibitive due either to prospective cost  availability of patients in the target population  or logistics 
we have no plans to initiate such a trial unless adequate funding is secured 
the additional phase iii clinical trial will need to be completed and data submitted to the fda before we can complete our regulatory submission 
we obtained a ce mark approval in europe for our plasma system in november and final french approval of intercept treated plasma in may in february  the first approval for use of intercept treated plasma was obtained from the paul ehrlich institute by a blood center in germany 
in some countries  including several in europe  we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than in europe 
intercept treated plasma was recently granted orphan drug status by the fda for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
although we have completed clinical trials in this patient population  the fda may require us to complete additional clinical trials before approval would be granted 
should the fda require us to complete additional clinical trials  we would need to secure adequate funding before we would initiate such a trial 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by bpac 
should the fda ask bpac questions  we expect bpac to answer those questions and make recommendations to the fda 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily have to approve those products 
if bpac were to answer fda questions recommending against approval of one or more of our products  the fda would have to take into consideration the points of concern raised by bpac which could affect the approval of the products 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale in the united states  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice  or gmp  and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united 
table of contents states  and could result in an enforcement action  which could harm our business 
the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for international distribution and sale are not fda qualified facilities 
it will require both time and expense to obtain such qualification 
the fda will require  and other regulatory authorities may also require  a post marketing clinical study  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate a redesign of our product or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
we expect the fda will require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects in the proposed second phase iii trial of the platelet system 
as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in two patients in the chronic arm of the trials  we have been conducting additional research and development activities on our red blood cell system to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results from these additional research activities as well as additional in vitro and in vivo studies and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of to test modifications to the red blood cell system 
that new phase i clinical trial was completed in early  successfully meeting its primary endpoint of red cell recovery measured twenty four hours after transfusion 
in addition to red cell recovery  we also measured red cell lifespan  measured as the half life of red cells circulating in transfusion recipients 
intercept treated red blood cells fell within the established normal reference range for red blood cells 
non treated red cells were above the established normal reference range 
significantly lower lifespan for intercept treated red blood cells compared to non treated red blood cells may inhibit our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or may impair market acceptance if the red blood cell system is successfully developed 
a number of trial design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our research and development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing  conducting trials or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further studies may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements in several countries around the world  including the united states  germany  canada  austria  and australia  and other countries  applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  
table of contents the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
in those countries  blood centers and other customers are required to obtain approved license supplements from the appropriate regulatory authorities in each country before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals 
these requirements or regulators delays in approving license applications or supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit applications or supplements for manufacturing and sale may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
in august  in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from bioone  we regained the rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
regulatory authorities in these countries may require our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval 
we have limited experience operating a global commercial organization 
we rely on third parties to market  sell  distribute and maintain our products and to maintain customer relationships in a certain countries 
we are responsible for sales  marketing  distribution  maintenance and regulatory support of the intercept blood system worldwide 
if we fail in our efforts to develop or maintain such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our attempts to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we have a wholly owned subsidiary  headquartered in the netherlands  dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in geographies where the intercept platelet and plasma systems are approved or can be imported through the import license process 
we will need to maintain and continue to increase our competence in a number of functions  including sales  marketing  regulatory  inventory and logistics  customer service  credit and collections  risk management  and quality assurance systems 
many of these competencies require compliance with european union and local standards and practices  with which we have limited experience 
we have entered into contracts  generally on a geographically exclusive basis  with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our pathogen inactivation products directly 
we have entered into geographical distribution agreements for distribution in a number of countries in europe  the cis countries  the middle east and australia 
we rely on these distributors to obtain any necessary in country regulatory approvals  market and sell the intercept blood system  provide customer and technical product support  maintain inventories  and adhere to our quality system in all material respects  among other activities 
while our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence  these distributors may fail to commercialize the intercept blood system in their respective territories 
they may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers 
initial purchases of uva illuminators or disposable kits by these third parties may not lead to follow on purchases of disposable platelet and plasma system kits 
we have limited visibility into the identity and requirements of blood banking customers these distributors may have 
accordingly  we may be unable to ensure our distributors properly maintain illuminators sold or provide quality technical services to the blood banking customers to which they sell 
agreements with our distributors typically require the distributor to maintain quality standards that are compliant with standards generally accepted for medical devices 
we may be unable to ensure that our distributors are compliant with such standards 
distributors may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general 
we may have little recourse  short of termination  in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations and contractual provisions 

table of contents our manufacturing supply chain exposes us to significant risks intercept platelet and plasma disposable kits are manufactured and assembled by fenwal 
fenwal has agreed  through a supply agreement signed with us in december  to manufacture disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for us through the end of after  fenwal may terminate the supply agreement  provided that fenwal shall have provided us thirty months prior notice of termination 
fenwal is our sole supplier for manufacture of these products 
fenwal may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of disposable kits or to do so on a cost effective basis  which would subject us to loss of revenue and reduced contribution margin 
we also have contracts with independent suppliers  including nova biomedical corporation  or nova  for the manufacture of uva illuminators and certain components of the intercept blood system which are manufactured or assembled at facilities not owned by fenwal 
these contractors are our sole suppliers for such components 
nova has not manufactured uva illuminators for a number of years 
should nova have difficulties manufacturing uva illuminators  we may not be able to supply customer demand or provide replacement uva illuminators to existing customers 
facilities at which the intercept blood system or its components are manufactured may cease operations for planned or unplanned reasons  causing at least temporary interruptions in supply 
we do not have qualified suppliers beyond those on whom we currently rely  and we understand that fenwal relies substantially on sole suppliers of certain materials for our products 
if we need to or choose to identify and qualify alternate suppliers  the process will be time consuming and costly 
even a temporary failure to supply adequate numbers of intercept blood system components may cause an irreparable loss of customer goodwill 
if we conclude that supply of the intercept blood system or components from fenwal and others is uncertain  we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials  work in process components  or finished goods  which would consume capital resources and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient 
some components of the uva illuminator device are no longer manufactured  which will require us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
future supply of illuminators is limited to availability of components  some of which are in short supply or are no longer manufactured 
we will likely be required to redesign the illuminator used in the platelet and plasma systems to manage the risk of obsolete components 
such redesign may be expensive and lead to regulatory delays in obtaining approvals to market the redesigned device 
fenwal manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
in order to be used in clinical studies or sold in the united states  our products would be required to be manufactured in fda approved facilities 
fda validation of manufacturing facilities  whether owned by fenwal or by other parties  will be costly and time consuming 
if we attempt to establish alternate manufacturers  we will be dependent on fenwal to transfer know how relevant to the manufacture of the intercept blood system  however  certain of fenwal s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to fenwal 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to fenwal  nova  or other suppliers without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review 
fenwal is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
raw material and component suppliers may not meet quality specifications we have set  which would cause a disruption in supply and may lead to lost sales and irreparable damage to our customer relationships 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 
in the event of a failure by fenwal or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the 
table of contents full loss of business opportunity 
our supply agreements with fenwal and nova  and supply agreements with others contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
a supplier s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 
our product supply chain requires us to purchase certain components in minimum quantities and may result in a production cycle of more than one year 
significant disruptions to any of the steps in our supply chain process  may result in longer productions cycles which could lead to inefficient use of cash 
we are in the early stages of commercializing the intercept blood system and may not accurately forecast demand for the intercept blood system 
as a result  we may carry excess work in process or finished goods inventory  which would consume capital resources and may become obsolete  or our inventory may be inadequate to meet customer demand 
we have entered into certain public tenders  some which call for us to maintain certain minimum levels of inventory 
if fenwal or third party manufacturers fail to produce components or our finished products satisfactorily  at acceptable costs  and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  or non compliance with certain public tenders which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations or loss of customers 
our platelet and plasma system disposables have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
we and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers prior to the expiration of product shelf life  which would require that we destroy or consume the outdated inventory in product demonstration activities 
product expiration may in turn lead to elevated product demonstration costs or reduced gross margins 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected and stored in storage solutions  called intersol and ssp  and for platelets suspended in plasma 
in order to address the entire market in the united states  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
in order to gain regulatory approvals for a pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we will need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
similarly  to achieve market acceptance in certain geographies  we may be required to design  develop and test new product configurations for the platelet and plasma systems 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms and may have competing pathogen inactivation technologies 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others may require adaptations to either the intercept blood system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the intercept blood system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment  if required 

table of contents we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the red blood cell system 
our red blood cell system that was used in our preclinical studies and phase i red blood cell trial was a prototype of the system to be used in the final products 
as a result  we plan to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
we may determine that the red blood cell system may not be commercially feasible from potential customers perspectives 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished  and our potential competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product will likely be substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
we will need to identify and contract with manufacturers who can develop processes to manufacture the compounds used in the red blood cell system 
for commercial manufacturing  we will need to demonstrate to regulatory authorities that the commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that the compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture the red blood cell system on a commercial scale 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our products and product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  and may compete with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to customer and prospective customer needs and medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
competitors products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
several companies have  or are developing  technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
these alternative strategies may be more effective in inactivating certain types of pathogens from blood products  including non lipid enveloped pathogens  such as hepatitis a virus  which our products have not demonstrated an ability to inactivate  or human parvovirus b  for which our products have not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
while our products can effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens in blood components  including more robust inactivation of many pathogens than has been shown by other companies  market acceptance of our products may be reduced if customers determine that competitor s products inactivate a broader range of pathogens that are of particular interest to the transfusion medicine community 
in addition  customers and prospective customers may believe that our competitor s products are safer or more cost effective than intercept blood system products 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma ag and macopharma international  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
caridianbct is developing a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued ce marks for a pathogen reduction system for both platelets and plasma 
we 
table of contents understand that caridianbct has also conducted a clinical trial on a pathogen inactivation system for whole blood 
caridian s product candidate  if successful  may offer competitive advantages over our intercept blood system 
companies developing competing products may also offer and sell other blood banking products and services 
as a result  competitors may have pre existing long term relationships with customers and may be able to offer synergies for both pathogen inactivation and non pathogen inactivation products that we are unable to offer 
new methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
other companies are marketing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  and developing synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
our insurance coverage may be inadequate to offset losses we may incur 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received 
for example  in cases where we have obtained regulatory approval for our products  we have demonstrated pathogen inactivation to specified levels based on well established tests 
however  there is no way to determine  after treatment by our products  whether our products have completely inactivated all of the pathogens that may be present in blood components 
there is also no way to determine whether any residual amount of a pathogen remains in the blood component treated by our products  and there is no way to exclude that such residual amount would be enough to cause disease in the transfused patient 
for ethical reasons  we cannot conduct human testing to determine whether an individual who receives a transfusion of a blood component containing a pathogen that was inactivated using the intercept blood system might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
while we believe  based on the clinical experience of our scientists  that the level of inactivated pathogens would likely be too small to induce a detectable antibody response in diagnostic tests  we cannot exclude that a transfused patient might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
we could be subject to a claim from a patient that tests positive  even though that patient did not contract a disease 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 

table of contents if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations or if we are unable to generate positive cash flows from our operations  we will need to curtail planned development or sales and commercialization activities 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell the intercept blood system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that our available cash balances and access to credit under our growth capital facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we have borrowed and in the future may borrow capital from institutional and commercial banking sources 
potential borrowings may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to product revenues  our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by global  regional or national economic conditions 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital we may need to curtail planned development 
we expect to prioritize continued commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  the cis  the middle east and in selected countries in other regions around the world 
in addition  we are developing and plan to perform the required clinical trials for product approval and commercialization of the red blood cell system 
to the extent that we are able to find funding  we will seek regulatory approval of the platelet or plasma systems in the united states 
historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
access to federal grants and cooperative agreements is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future research and development activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the year ended december  the platelet and plasma systems are not yet approved in the united states or in many other countries around the world 
the red blood cell system is in clinical development and may never emerge from the clinical development stage as a marketed product 
we may be required to reduce the sales price 
table of contents for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which may reduce or altogether eliminate our gross profit on sales 
at our present sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture  distribute  market  sell  support and administer the systems are in excess of revenue 
contribution from product sales is unlikely to exceed the costs we incur in research  development  and commercialization of the intercept blood system for the near term 
we expect our losses to continue at least until the intercept blood system achieves more significant market acceptance 
to the extent that we reach agreement on a clinical pathway with the fda for our platelet or plasma products and if we choose to pursue such opportunities  we would expect to incur substantial costs which could extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss 
we have issued long term notes payable containing certain covenants that we may be unable to comply with 
our operations may not provide sufficient cash to meet the repayment obligations of the note on march   we entered into a growth capital credit agreement  or the credit agreement  for million of which we immediately borrowed and issued a note payable for million 
in march  we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement and loan are secured by all of our us assets  except for intellectual property 
the amended credit agreement and note require that we comply with certain customary and routine covenants  including the requirement to meet growing revenue levels set at pre established levels 
for  our revenues  on a trailing six month basis  are required to be at least of our projected revenues 
for and beyond  our revenues are required to be at least million per quarter 
if we are unable to increase our product revenues to comply with the covenants in the amended credit agreement  the lender may call the note which would require us to repay the principal of the note sooner than we have anticipated 
in the event that the note was called due to non compliance with the covenants  we may be unable to pay back the principal which would allow the lender to liquidate collateralized assets 
this in turn  would harm our business 
in addition  our operations may not reach the levels needed to meet the scheduled repayment obligations of the note 
if we are unable to meet the scheduled repayment obligations of the note using our available cash  we may be forced to liquidate other assets  refinance the notes or issue equity securities to raise the necessary cash to meet our obligations 
there is no assurance that we would be able to sufficiently or timely liquidate assets to meet the note s repayment obligations or that we would be able to refinance the notes or issue equity  in which case our business would be significantly harmed and may force the company into bankruptcy 
our investment portfolio may become impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of december  consisted primarily of high credit  high liquidity united states government agency securities  asset backed securities  corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
as a result of adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
we have limited holdings of these investments in our portfolio 
we recognized other than temporary impairments of million on our investment portfolio during the year ended december  the recent global economic crisis has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 

table of contents virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
we also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have also taken measures to limit damage that may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage  system or component failure  or corruption of data files 
however  we may lose critical computerized data  which may be difficult or impossible to recreate  which may harm our business 
we may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems  which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences  up to and including loss of our abilities to conduct business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe there exists substantial questions concerning its validity 
we cannot be certain  however  that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems  if and when those products are sold in the united states 
our key patents generally expire at various dates between and recent patent applications will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
in addition  we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire from to due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if 
table of contents at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
our patents do not cover all of the countries in which we are selling  and planning to sell  our products 
we will not be able to prevent potential competitors from using our technology in countries where we do not have patent coverage 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and certain contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
consequently  we may suffer losses 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems and incur operating expenses in euros and other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january  to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock

we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
provisions of our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law  unless its application has been waived  provides certain default anti takeover protections in connection with transactions between the company and an interested stockholder of the company

overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of blood safety systems and  from until late  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
our intercept platelet system  or the platelet system  and our intercept plasma system  or the plasma system  have received ce marks and are being marketed in a number of countries in europe  the cis  and the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
in addition  we plan to continue development of our intercept red blood cell system 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants and or capital markets  we also plan to pursue regulatory approval of the intercept platelet and plasma systems in the united states 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell intercept  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that cash received from product sales  our available cash balances  and available credit under our growth capital credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the overall economic turmoil has generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and the terms less favorable to the companies seeking to raise financing 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to the disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide or other factors  we will need to curtail planned development and commercialization activities 
historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood system may decline when compared to historic levels 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal 
table of contents government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for the continued development of the intercept system in the united states at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
we recognize growing  but still relatively modest  product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in europe  the cis countries  the middle east  and certain other countries around the world 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our product candidates that  together with anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after our platelet and plasma systems gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our products are approved and in other regions around the world 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our blood safety products 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
we pay royalties to fenwal on product sales  at rates of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system  for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in december  we amended and extended our supply agreement with fenwal for the manufacture of intercept finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems through december  under the amended manufacturing agreement  we pay fenwal a set price per kit  which is established annually  plus a fixed surcharge per kit 
in addition  volume driven manufacturing overhead will be paid or refunded if actual manufacturing volumes are lower or higher than the annually estimated production volumes 
under the amended manufacturing agreement  we are responsible for providing certain disposable kit components to fenwal at no cost to fenwal 
this required us to enter into supply arrangements with certain other manufacturers for those components  some of which contain minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  can take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
in november  we spun off our immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc  or anza for preferred stock representing and equity interest of approximately of anza s preferred equity 
we accounted for the immunotherapy business as a discontinued operation and restated our consolidated financial statements for and prior periods to reflect that accounting treatment 
we were informed in february that anza had ceased operations 
in july  we entered into a three way license agreement with anza and aduro biotech and separate agreements with each of anza and aduro biotech collectively  the assignment agreements 
in november  anza transferred all of its intellectual property to aduro biotech  or aduro  pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreements 
in exchange for agreeing to the transfer and for relinquishing our shares in anza and releasing any claims against anza  we received million in cash  preferred shares representing of aduro s capital and a royalty on any future sales resulting from the transferred technology 
because aduro s technology and efforts are in the very early stage of research and development  we have no basis to assign value to the equity we have received in aduro or that such equity will have monetary value at such time we are allowed to sell it or that we will receive any royalties from aduro 
in august  we completed an acquisition of certain assets of bioone  including the commercialization rights that baxter later fenwal and we had granted to bioone for both the platelet and plasma systems 
concurrently with the acquisition  fenwal and we terminated such commercialization rights 
as a consequence of the termination  and pursuant to a pre existing agreement with fenwal  our commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems under our and agreements with baxter became worldwide 
as consideration for the acquired bioone assets  at the closing of the acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to bioone and relinquished all of the shares we previously held in bioone 
in addition  six months from the closing date of the acquisition  we issued an additional  shares of our stock to bioone 
accordingly  at december   we had recorded the fair value of the assets acquired  consisting of commercialization rights of million  and illuminators of million with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the asset acquired being recorded as goodwill 
the million in goodwill represents the 
table of contents buyer specific value derived by cerus as a result of acquiring the commercialization rights in certain asian countries in order to complete the global commercialization rights for platelets and plasma 
through december   in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems  we have recognized revenue from grants and cooperative agreements with the armed forces 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accrued liabilities  valuation and impairment of purchased intangibles and goodwill  non cash stock compensation assumptions  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliverables  as applicable 
revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an agreement with the funding party exists  ii services have been rendered or product has been delivered  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement 
for all sales of our intercept blood system products  we use a binding purchase order and signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement 
we sell intercept blood system for platelets and plasma directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of non conforming product 
deliverables and the units of accounting vary according to the provisions of each purchase order or sales contract 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  we evaluate whether the delivered elements have stand alone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is reliably determinable  and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within our control 
when all of these conditions are met  we recognize the revenue on the delivered elements 
if these conditions are not met  we defer revenue until such time as all of the conditions have been met or all of the elements have been delivered 
consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting based on the relative fair market value method 
freight costs charged to customers are recorded as a component of revenue and value added taxes  or vat  that we invoice to our customers and remit to governments are recorded on a net basis  which excludes such vat from product revenue 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support research in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
inventory we own work in process inventory for certain components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  can 
table of contents take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
under our manufacturing agreement with fenwal  our carrying value of intercept disposable kits is dependent on an annually set price 
in addition  at the end of each year  volume driven manufacturing overhead is either paid or refunded by or to us if manufacturing volumes are higher or lower than the anticipated manufacturing volumes at the time the price is established 
as a result  manufacturing overhead can fluctuate and requires us to use judgment in accruing the manufacturing overhead 
in addition  we use judgment in determining whether the manufacturing overhead is a cost of our inventory and recoverable when product is sold 
we use significant judgment and evaluate manufacturing variances incurred during periods of abnormally low production by considering a variety of factors including the reasons for low production volumes  anticipated future production levels that correlate to and offset volumes experienced during abnormally low production cycles  and contractual requirements 
we record manufacturing variances incurred during periods of abnormally low production volumes as a component of cost of product revenue 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our platelet and plasma system disposable kits generally have a two year shelf life from the date of manufacture 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable and frequently review such determinations 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform this analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use  using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as transition services and development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 
purchased intangible assets and goodwill we purchased certain assets from bioone in for accounting purposes  we accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in accordance with asc  business combinations 
as a result of the acquisition  we used significant judgment in identifying the assets acquired and in determining the fair values to record the purchased assets on our balance sheet 
some areas requiring significant judgment include cash flows  discount rates  and economic lives 
in addition  under asc  we were required to assess the fair value of the non controlling interest that we held in bioone prior to the acquisition 
we determined that a considerable amount of the purchase consideration was goodwill  which represents value unique to cerus as the holder of worldwide rights to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to realize the recorded value of the acquired assets and our assumptions may prove to be incorrect which may require us to write down or impair the value of the assets if and when facts and circumstances indicate a need to do so 
we will perform an impairment test on goodwill annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
warrants in and  we issued warrants to purchase million and million shares of common stock  respectively 
the material terms of the warrants were identical under each issuance except for the exercise price and date issued 
the outstanding warrants are classified as a liability  and as such  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at each subsequent reporting period  the fair value of the warrants are adjusted with changes in fair value of the warrants reflected on the consolidated balance sheet and gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of non operating income expense 
the fair value of the warrants is estimated using the binomial lattice option pricing model 
this model requires that we use significant assumptions and judgment to determine appropriate inputs to the 
table of contents model 
some of the assumptions that we rely on include probability of a change of control occurring  the volatility of our stock over the life of the warrant  and assumptions and inputs used to value the warrants under the black scholes model should a change of control occur 
stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  members of our board of directors  our scientific advisory board and certain contractors as strategic  long term incentives 
we recorded stock based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of a stock award 
we continue to apply the provisions of accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunctions with selling  goods or services  for our non employee stock based awards 
under the provisions  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the grantee s performance is complete 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of the vested portion of the non employee awards in our consolidated statements of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model calculates the grant date fair value using certain variables 
these variables are impacted by our stock price  award exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and our expected dividends and many of these variables require us to use significant judgment 
expected term 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using a variety of factors 
where possible  we estimate the expected term of options granted by analyzing employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior 
to make this estimation  we analyze the population of options granted by discrete homogeneous groups 
for those homogeneous groups where we are unable to obtain sufficient information to estimate the expected term in this manner  we estimate the expected term of the options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the term of each offering period 
estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the forfeiture rate of options at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we estimate the historic pre vesting forfeiture rates by groups that possess a degree of homogeneity regarding average time to vest and expected term 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
estimated volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility of our common stock 
we have used significant judgment in making these estimates and we will continue to monitor the availability of actively traded options on our common stock 
if we determine that sufficient actively traded options on our common stock exist  we may consider a combination of historical and implied volatility  or solely implied volatility 
risk free interest rate 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on united states treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if factors change and we utilize different assumptions in determining the grant date fair value of stock compensation expense in the future  or if we utilize a different option pricing model in the future  then those results may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
there is significant risk that the black scholes option pricing model and the judgment we have 
table of contents used in ascertaining the variables will yield results that differ materially from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  termination or forfeitures of the awards in the future 
historical results were utilized in deriving our variables  which may not be indicative of the future 
income taxes since our inception  we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 
we do not recognize tax positions that have a lower than likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
we did not have any recorded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at december  or we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense 
to date  we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our statements of operations  nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties 
we continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions  there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  change to change to in thousands  except percentages product revenue government grant and cooperative agreements total revenue product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the prior year 
this increase was largely driven by an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  the cis countries  and the middle east 
on a product basis  the increase was largely driven by an increase of million in uva illuminator sales and an increase of million in sales of platelet and plasma disposable kits 
product revenue increased million to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the increase was largely driven by an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  the cis  and the middle east 
we anticipate product revenue for both the platelet and plasma systems will continue to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
historical results may not be indicative of intercept blood system revenue in the future 
we recognized million in revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to an increase in the activities subject to reimbursement under new and existing awards with the united states department of defense  or dod

our realized gross margins on product sales were in  up from in  and up from in the changes in our gross margins are affected by various factors  including manufacturing and supply chain costs  the mix of product sold  and the mix of customers to which product is sold 
generally  we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes  depending on their purchase commitments which depending on sales volumes to those distributors receiving tiered volume discounts  may impact our gross margins 
we expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecast demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in manufacturing at levels above the levels produced in should result in a continuing lower per unit cost of goods sold when the product is ultimately sold 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  non cash stock based compensation  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies

research and development expenses may increase as we prepare for initiation of a phase iii clinical trial for our red blood cell system  or if we pursue regulatory approval of the platelet or plasma systems in the united states 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including  but not limited to  intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical trial results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  see risk factors in part i  item a above

during the year ended december   we also incurred costs associated with consolidating facilities and certain other costs associated with the restructuring plan 
most of the costs accrued as one time termination benefits as of march  were paid by december  and any remaining costs were paid by december  acquisition related costs and impairment of long term investment in related parties  net during  we acquired certain assets from bioone corporation and relinquished our non controlling equity interest in them

the warrants will continue to be reported as a liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions that require this treatment  at which time the warrants will be adjusted to fair value and reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity 
at december   no warrants had been exercised 
if the warrants are reclassified from a liability to equity  the fair value of the warrants would be recorded in stockholders equity and no further adjustment would be made in subsequent periods 
future changes in stock price will result in similar adjustments as needed 
foreign exchange gain loss we recorded foreign currency losses of million for the year ended december   compared to losses of million for the comparable period of the increase of million in foreign currency losses was primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign currency variances  primarily the euro to us dollar rates 
we recorded foreign currency losses of million for the year ended december   compared to a foreign currency gain of million during the comparable period of the increase in foreign currency losses was also attributable to unfavorable foreign currency variations between the euro and us dollar  our functional currency

we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
we generally hold such investments until such time as we liquidate them to meet an operating cash need 
interest paid on our investment portfolio may decrease and the value of certain securities we hold may decline  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  our sources of capital have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  debt instruments  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  and contribution from product sales net of expenses and interest income 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million during the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher revenues  improved gross margins and lower operating expenses  offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably increases in accounts receivable balances and lower accrued expenses 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million during the comparable period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably decreases in our accounts receivable and inventory balances  partially offset by decreases in our accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was million compared to million of cash provided by investing activities during the decrease in cash provided from investing activities was primarily due to fewer maturities of short term investments in compared to and higher purchases of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements in compared to during  we relocated our headquarters and capitalized leasehold improvements associated with the leasehold build out

our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  costs associated with 
table of contents pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that cash received from product sales  our available cash balances  and available credit under our growth capital credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth on terms that may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the overall economic turmoil has generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and the terms less favorable to the companies seeking to raise financing 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will need to curtail planned development and commercialization activities 
historically  we had received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood systems may decline when compared to historic levels 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for the continued development of the intercept system in the united states at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in late october we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  and or debt securities 
this shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec in december we have issued approximately million of the securities registered for issuance pursuant to the shelf registration statement

operating leases we lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs  property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
on december   we exercised a ten year extension option to extend the term of our lease relating to stanwell drive in concord  california 
by exercising this extension option  our lease payments will be increased 
our facility leases qualify as operating leases under fasb asc topic  leases and as such  are not included on our balance sheet 
other commitments our other commitments consist of financing obligations for payment of certain insurance premiums that expire in in addition to the operating leases we have for office and laboratory space  certain of our leases provide for landlord financed leasehold improvements 
at december   we had financed million of leasehold improvements 
we pay for the financed leasehold improvements as a component of rent and are required to reimburse our landlords over the remaining life of the respective leases 
our concord california lease may be canceled no earlier than december  at which time we would be required to repay for any remaining portion of the landlord financed leasehold improvements 
long term note payable on march   we entered into a growth capital facility agreement  under which we immediately borrowed and issued a senior secured long term note payable for million 
notes issued under the agreement are secured by all of our assets  except intellectual property 
the note carries a fixed interest rate of  with interest only payments for the first nine months and then equal principal and interest payments for an additional months 
in connection with issuing the note  we agreed to pay an upfront facility fee of million and incurred closing costs of million 
the combined facility fee and closing costs have been recorded as a discount to the note payable and will be amortized as a component of interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the note discount is based on an implied interest rate of 
in addition  we agreed to pay a million closing fee upon maturity of the note 
the closing fee will be accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the note 
under the growth capital facility  subject to certain conditions including compliance with covenants  an additional million was available to be drawn between september  and december  as of december   we had not drawn down on the additional million  and we incurred a non utilization fee of million as a result 
in march  we entered into an amendment with the lender 
under the terms of the 
table of contents amendment  we may borrow an additional million under the note payable through september  the terms of the additional million note would be identical to the first note issued under the growth capital facility 
we would not incur any additional upfront facility fees 
we are required to maintain compliance with certain customary and routine financial covenants 
additionally  the note requires us to generate minimum revenues at certain pre established levels 
under the amendment  our revenues are required to be at least of our projected revenues on a trailing six month basis 
for and beyond  our revenues are required to be at least million per quarter 
as of december  we were in compliance with financial covenants set forth in the growth capital facility 
financial instruments we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities
