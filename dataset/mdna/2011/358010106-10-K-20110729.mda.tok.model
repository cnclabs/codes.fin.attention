item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of this backlog is expected to be filled during the company s fiscal year ending april  included in the backlog at april  is approximately million under cost plus fee contracts which the company believes represent firm commitments from its customers for which the company has not received full funding to date 
the company excludes from backlog any contracts or awards for which it has not received authorization to proceed 
on fixed price contracts  the company excludes any unfunded portion which  as of april   was approximately million 
the company expects these contracts to become fully funded over time and will be added to its backlog at that time 
the backlog is subject to change by reason of several factors including possible cancellation of orders  change orders  terms of the contracts and other factors beyond the company control 
accordingly  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the revenues or profits losses which may be realized when the results of such contracts are reported

during fiscal year  at t and spiral solutions and technologies were major customers of the fei zyfer segment each accounting for more than of that segment s revenues 
for the year ended april   at t and the state of california each accounted for more than of the fei zyfer segment s revenues 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company technological expertise continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components 
the company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite commercial and us government and terrestrial commercial communications systems  including wireless  wireline and gps related systems 
during fiscal years and  the company expended million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal years and  many of the company s development resources were applied to certain cost plus fee satellite payload programs 
as a result  some of the company s development efforts were customer funded and the costs appear in cost of revenues resulting in reduced internal research and development spending 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend between million and million on internal research and development projects 
the actual amount spent in fiscal year will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
in  the company obtained a basic patent for its low g sensitivity technology 
competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business

the company has a unique and broad product line which includes quartz  rubidium  and cesium based timing references and specialized rf microwave technology 
because of the very high precision of certain of its products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there is significant competition from a number of suppliers 
in recent years  the company has successfully outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
the company believes its ability to obtain raw materials  manufacture finished products  integrate them into systems and sub systems and interface these systems with end user applications provides a strong competitive advantage 
certain of the company competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
the company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality  reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved 
with respect to its instruments and systems for timing and synchronization  the company competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this annual report on form k regarding future earnings and operations and other statements relating to the future constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  inability to integrate operations and personnel  actions by significant customers or competitors  general domestic and international economic conditions  consumer spending trends  reliance on key customers  continued acceptance of the company products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings 
the factors listed above are not exhaustive 
other sections of this k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
any or all of the forward looking statements contained in this k and any other public statement made by the company or its management may turn out to be incorrect 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the fei ny segment  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory write downs are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
marketable securities all of the company s investments in marketable securities are level securities which trade on public markets and have current prices that are readily available 
in general  investments in fixed price securities are only in the commercial paper of financially sound corporations or the bonds of us government agencies 
although the value of such investments may fluctuate significantly based on economic factors  the company s own financial strength enables it to wait for the securities to either recover their value or to mature such that any interim unrealized gains or losses are deemed to be temporary 
results of operations significant matters reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reduced its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
this recognition was the result of a review of all available evidence as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the us  including the negative evidence of cumulative losses in prior years which required the recording of a substantial valuation allowance in fiscal year management of the company considered the profitable performance for fiscal years and as well as substantial new contract awards which have increased the company s long term backlog to its highest level over the previous year period 
such contracts will enable the company to continue to generate operating profits in fiscal year and beyond 
management believes these factors overcome the prior years cumulative loss position 
based on this assessment  the company s management believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the tax benefits from the future deductibility of many items included in its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company reduced by million the previous million valuation allowance that had been established in prior periods 
the amount of the non cash valuation allowance reduction was based on management s estimates of taxable income by reporting segment and taxing jurisdictions and the period over which the company believes deferred tax assets will be realized 
the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april  and  the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating profit other income expenses  net benefit for income taxes net income revenues fiscal years ended april  in millions change fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales the increase in revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  is due primarily to growth in all business areas served by the fei ny segment satellite payloads for both us government and commercial applications  us government dod non space products and wireless telecommunications networks 
revenue increases in the first two business areas were anticipated based on recently awarded contracts by satellite manufacturers for payload time and frequency systems and from us government contractors for low g sensitivity products 
certain telecommunication network infrastructure oem s unexpectedly increased their orders for components for use in wireless networks  including replacing systems destroyed by the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan 
revenues for the gillam fei segment which are derived from wireline telecommunications networks and network management systems  were relatively flat year over year  while sales at fei zyfer declined 
the decrease in fei zyfer s sales volume reflects some of the impact from the current us government budgetary issues which are preventing certain dod programs from obtaining funding and therefore may either delay the program or cause it to be canceled 
revenues for fiscal year decreased by compared to fiscal year  as a result of lower revenues from sales of wireless infrastructure products and other commercial products recorded in the fei ny segment 
as discussed in prior years  future revenues for wireless telecommunications products are uncertain as oems slow installation of new network equipment or migrate to different technologies supporting shorter independent timing capabilities or reduced quality of service which do not require the precision timing devices that the company supplies 
these lower revenues in fiscal year were partially offset by increased sales from the company s usg productline for the us domestic wireline market which are generated by the fei zyfer segment 
many of the usg products are produced and sold by gillam fei to fei zyfer accounting for a significant element of intersegment sales 
revenues from satellite payload programs were moderately lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues from us government space programs increased by year over year but these increases were offset by continued low levels of activity in commercial satellite space programs 
revenues from us government dod non space programs  which are recorded in the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  increased by more than year over year and accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year based on the company s current backlog and potential for additional new orders  the company  expects fiscal year revenues from satellite payloads to increase substantially  growing to nearly half of consolidated revenues 
revenues from the other major business areas  us government dod non space and network infrastructure  are expected to remain at approximately the same levels as in fiscal year consolidated revenues for fiscal year are expected to increase significantly compared to fiscal year with the major portion of that increase occurring in the fei ny segment 
gross margin rates fiscal years ended april  in thousands change gm rate for each of the years ended april  and  gross margin increased both in total and as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year 
the million increase in gross margin for fiscal year is due to both increased revenue and an improved rate 
the and gross margin rates in fiscal years and approach the company s expected rate at current revenue levels 
during fiscal years and  cost of sales includes inventory write downs of million and million  respectively  which reduced gross margin rates by and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company reached an agreement with a wireless telecommunications network customer and received  representing a portion of the cost of certain unique inventory items that the customer no longer required and recorded this amount as a reduction to cost of goods sold during the period 
the fiscal year inventory write downs included the unique inventory items 
with the current mix of programs and orders in its backlog  the company expects to realize gross margin rates in the upper to low range during fiscal year as revenues increase in future periods  the company expects to realize a higher gross margin as more of its fixed costs are covered 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change in both fiscal years ended april  and  selling and administrative costs were of revenues 
the increase in expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due primarily to increased deferred and incentive compensation expenses resulting from greater profitability and partially offset by a decrease in professional fee expense 
fiscal year expenses declined from fiscal year due to decreases in sales commissions and personnel costs including decreased employee benefits resulting from reductions in personnel that took place during the latter portion of fiscal year such decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense as a result of the company s improved profitability 
for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
the company targets selling and administrative expenses at of consolidated sales 
for fiscal year  with rising revenues  the company expects to incur selling and administrative expenses at less than of revenues 
research and development expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change research and development expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future revenues 
r d spending in fiscal years and was and  respectively  of consolidated revenue compared to the company s target of of revenues 
r d spending in fiscal year continued the development of new satellite payload products  a new family of frequency generators and converters  and new product introductions and improvements in the technology of the company s gps based wireless products and wireline synchronization equipment 
during the fiscal year ended april   r d spending increased in comparison to fiscal year this increase was the result of the company s added emphasis on the development of new space hardware including development of new c and ku band beacon telemetry transceivers and a new family of frequency generators and converters 
in both fiscal years and  the company continued to conduct development activities on customer funded programs the cost of which appears in cost of revenues  thus reducing the level of internal research and development spending 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will continue to make investments in improved satellite payload products from dc to ka band  develop and improve miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium oscillators 
the company will also be engaged in development efforts that are funded by its customers  the results of which will enhance its own product offerings 
thus  the company s target for fiscal year is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating profit fiscal years ended april  in thousands change higher revenues  improved gross margin rates and operating expenses in line with expectations for fiscal year enabled the company to record an operating profit nearly twice the operating profit recorded in fiscal year on a segment basis  the operating profit of fei ny increased as a result of higher revenues and improved gross margin 
the operating profit at gillam fei was impacted by both product mix and inventory writedowns which reduced gross margin  while fei zyfer s operating profit increased due primarily to lower research and development expenses 
the operating profit for the year ended april  resulted from substantially improved gross margin rates and lower operating expenses than experienced in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recorded an operating loss as a result of higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload products and a significant write down of certain wireless telecommunications inventory 
such expenses did not reoccur in the subsequent fiscal years 
based on recently received new contracts for satellite payload programs and continuing new orders for us government dod non space applications and wireline telecommunication products  the company expects to continue to improve its gross margin while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
thus  the company expects to report higher operating profits in fiscal year other income expense fiscal years ended april  in thousands change investment income equity loss impairment charge nm interest expense other expense income  net investment income includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
earnings on these securities may vary based on fluctuating interest rate levels and the timing of purchases or sales of securities 
in the current low interest rate environment  earnings on fixed income securities have been significantly reduced 
during fiscal years and  investment income was reduced by approximately  and  respectively  as a result of losses upon the sale or redemption of certain marketable securities in its portfolio 
during fiscal year  unless interest rates begin to increase  the company anticipates that investment income will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year the equity loss in fiscal years and represents the company s share of the income or loss recorded by elcom in which the company owns a interest 
also  during fiscal year  based on comparisons to comparable companies as well as elcom s forecasts of future financial results  the company recorded impairment charges in the amount of  in addition to its equity share in elcom s income or loss 
in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations  on deferred compensation payments and capital leases for equipment 
during the year ended april   the company paid down its bank line of credit 
that payment along with declining balances of capital lease obligations reduced interest expense 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will continue to decrease as the capital leases are paid down 
other expenses for the year ended april   consisted primarily of charges on certain financial instruments and foreign currency exchange losses at the company s overseas subsidiaries 
during the year ended april   other expenses also included royalty expenses which were not incurred during fiscal year the company anticipates that in future years items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income tax benefit fiscal years ended april  in thousands change as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reduced by million the previously established million valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
this reduction was based on a review of all available evidence  both positive and negative  and management s assessment that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the tax benefits from the future deductibility of many items included in its deferred tax assets 
excluding the valuation allowance reduction  the company recorded a net tax provision of million or an effective tax rate of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the actual tax benefit to the expected tax provision at the federal statutory rate 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company also recorded a net tax benefit as a result of obtaining a tax refund from the carryback of the previous year s net loss to an earlier profitable tax year 
such refund became available to the company as a result of legislation enacted by the united states in november  which permitted corporations to carryback net operating losses up to years versus the previous year limitation 
before this legislation was enacted  the company anticipated receiving a tax benefit of approximately  and recorded a receivable on that basis 
due to the change in tax law  the company recognized a net tax benefit of million of which million is attributable to the effect of the new law 
the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states  in europe and in china 
in fiscal year  reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance created a net tax benefit which offset the tax expense from that year s pre tax income 
in fiscal year  the million tax refund created a current benefit that offset the current tax provision and the increase in the valuation allowance 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
for state income tax purposes  the company has tax loss carryforwards of approximately million in california and million in new york 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal years and  the company incurred million and million  respectively  in non cash charges to earnings  including depreciation and amortization expense  the equity loss on its elcom investment  and certain employee benefit plan expenses  including accounting for stock based compensation 
such non cash charges were partially offset by the non cash benefit of million resulting from the company s reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
for fiscal year  operating cash was reduced by increases to accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  higher profits required increased estimated income tax payments as compared to the year ended april   when the company received a million income tax refund from the carryback of fiscal year s tax loss 
in fiscal year  the company anticipates that it will maintain positive cash flow from operations by continuing to generate operating profits 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended april   resulting from the net purchase of marketable securities for million and the acquisition of capital equipment for million 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was  which consisted of net proceeds on the sale or redemption of marketable securities of  the repayment of a note receivable from elcom of  offset by a new note from elcom in the amount of  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment for  the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment and acquisition strategies 
the company will continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process 
the company intends to spend between million and million on capital equipment during fiscal year internally generated cash is expected to be adequate to acquire this property  plant and equipment 
the company has a million line of credit with the financial institution which also manages a substantial portion of its investment in marketable securities
