item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of energysolutions included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  that are based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  and that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of a broad range of nuclear services to government and commercial customers who rely on our expertise to address their needs throughout the lifecycle of their nuclear operations 
our broad range of nuclear services includes engineering  in plant support services  spent nuclear fuel management  decontamination and decommissioning d d services  operation of nuclear reactors  logistics  transportation  processing  and llrw disposal 
we derive almost of our revenue from the provision of nuclear services 
we provide our services through four segments federal services  commercial services  logistics  processing and disposal lp d and international 
our federal services segment derives revenue from us government customers for the management and operation m o of facilities with radioactive materials 
our us government customers are primarily individual offices  departments and administrations within the doe and the dod 
our commercial services segment provides a broad range of on site services to our commercial customers who include power and utility companies  pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities and other commercial entities with nuclear materials  as well as state agencies in the us our lp d segment provides a broad range of logistics  transportation  processing and disposal services to government and commercial customers 
this segment also operates our facilities for the processing and disposal of radioactive materials  including a facility in clive  utah  four facilities in tennessee  and two facilities in barnwell  south carolina 
in cases where a project involves the provision of both specialized nuclear services and processing and disposal services  our federal services or commercial services segment  and our lp d segment will coordinate to provide integrated services 
components of revenue and expenses revenue and cost of revenue federal services segment we generate revenue in our federal services segment primarily from m o and clean up services on doe and dod sites that have radioactive materials 
under tier contracts  we typically provide services as an integrated member of a prime contract team 
under tier contracts  we provide services to tier contractors on a subcontracted basis 
tier contracts often include an award fee in excess of incurred costs  and may also include an incentive fee for meeting contractual targets  milestones  or performance factors 
historically  the majority of our federal services segment revenue has been generated from either tier cost reimbursable contracts with award typically based on a percentage of cost or incentive typically success based fees  or tier contracts that are cost reimbursable  fixed price  or unit rate contracts 
when we have provided services as an integrated member of a tier prime contract team  we have typically entered into a contract with the other members of the team in which we share the 
table of contents award or incentive fees under the customer contract 
the revenue characteristics of these contracts are as follows tier contract  acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we act as lead prime contractor in a fee sharing arrangement  we submit invoices to the customer for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services  and we also submit to the customer the cost recovery invoices of the other team members that have been submitted to us 
depending on the nature of the contract  we typically recognize as revenue the entire amount of our fee and cost reimbursement as lead prime contractor  and record an expense for the portion of the fee and cost reimbursement that we pay to the other team members in proportion to their respective percentages of the fee sharing arrangement and costs 
as a result  when we act as lead prime contractor  we recognize higher revenue and may realize higher gross profits but lower gross margins than when we do not act as lead prime contractor 
tier contract  not acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we do not act as lead prime contractor  we submit invoices to the lead prime contractor for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services  including allocated selling  general and administrative expenses  as allowed by the customer  and we may receive a portion of the fee in direct proportion to our percentage of a fee sharing arrangement 
we include in revenue the amount to be received as reimbursement for costs incurred plus the portion of the fee that we will receive 
the majority of our tier contracts have historically fallen into this category 
tier contract 
tier contracts are typically discrete  project driven transactions procured by tier contractors 
the majority of tier contracts are fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
we generally do not participate in fee share arrangements as a tier contractor 
revenue in our federal services segment can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in the timing and size of contract awards in any given period  whether or not we are required to consolidate revenue under a joint venture agreement  the completion or expiration of large contracts  and delays in congressional appropriations for contracts we have been awarded 
we typically generate revenue in our federal services segment pursuant to long term contracts 
the process of bidding for government contracts is extremely competitive and time consuming 
discussions relating to a potential government contract often begin one or two years before release of a rfp 
an additional year or two years may pass between the government announcement of an rfp and its award of a contract  and an additional several months may pass before we begin to recognize revenue in connection with that contract 
cost of revenue in our federal services segment consists of primarily compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects  and travel expenses 
commercial services segment we generate revenue in our commercial services segment through fixed price  unit rate  and cost reimbursable contracts with power and utility companies that operate nuclear power plants and  to a lesser extent  with pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities and other commercial entities that have nuclear related operations 
most of the revenue in our commercial services segment is derived from contracts with a term of less than one year 
revenue in our commercial services segment can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in customer requirements  which depend upon the operating schedules of nuclear reactors  emergency response operations  and other clean up events 
the operating schedules of nuclear reactors are affected by  among other things  seasonality in the demand for electricity  and reactor refueling and maintenance schedules 
power and utility companies typically schedule refueling 
table of contents and maintenance to coincide with periods of reduced power demand periods in the spring and fall 
therefore  our revenue is typically higher during these periods due to the increased demand for our on site services 
our revenue also fluctuates from period to period as our commercial power and utility customers start or terminate project operations 
revenue from emergency response operations and other clean up activities may also cause fluctuations in our results due to the unanticipated nature of events that are in these projects 
revenue in our commercial services segment also depends on the decisions of our customers to incur expenditures for third party nuclear services 
for example  they may choose to store radioactive materials on site  rather than transporting materials for commercial processing and disposal at a third party facility  such as our clive  utah facility 
similarly  customers may defer entering into contracts for d d services at nuclear plants that have been shut down until such time as they have additional dedicated funds 
cost of revenue in our commercial services segment primarily consist of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects  and travel expenses 
cost of revenue also includes the accretion expense related to our zion aro  zion aro settlement gains or losses as work is performed on the zion station decommissioning project  and any changes in cost estimates related to the zion aro 
results of our operations for services provided to our customers in canada and mexico currently relate to services provided to our utility customers and are included in our commercial services segment with the exception of monserco  which is included in lp d 
lp d segment we generate revenue in our lp d segment primarily through unit rate contracts for the transportation  processing and disposal of radioactive materials 
in general  the unit rate contracts entered into by our lp d segment use a standardized set of purchase order type contracts containing standard pricing and other terms 
by using standardized contracts  we are able to expedite individual project contract negotiations with our customers through means other than formal bidding processes 
for example  our life of plant contracts provide nuclear power and utility company customers with llrw and mllw processing and disposal services for the remaining lives of their nuclear power plants  as well as d d waste disposal services after those plants are shut down 
these contracts generally provide that we will process and dispose of substantially all of the llrw and mllw generated by those plants for a fixed  pre negotiated price per cubic foot  depending on the type of radioactive material being disposed  and often include periodic price adjustments 
although life of plant contracts may be terminated before decommissioning work is complete  we typically expect the duration of these contracts to be in excess of ten years 
revenue in our lp d segment can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of our customers decommissioning activities 
we can receive high volumes of radioactive materials in a relatively short time period when a customer site or facility is being decommissioned 
cost of revenue in our lp d segment consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses of employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  such as rail transportation of radioactive materials from a customer site to one of our facilities for processing and disposal  costs of goods purchased for use in our facilities  licenses  permits  taxes on processed radioactive materials  maintenance of facilities  equipment costs  and depreciation costs 
most of our fixed assets are in our lp d segment  and we recognize the majority of our depreciation costs in this segment 

table of contents international segment we generate revenue in our international segment primarily through tier contracts with the nuclear decommissioning authority nda 
as a tier contractor  we are reimbursed for allowable incurred costs 
in addition  we receive cost efficiency fees a percentage of budgeted costs minus actual costs for work performed and project delivery based incentive fees 
we typically recognize as revenue the full amount of reimbursed allowable costs incurred plus the amount of fees earned  and we record as expense the amount of our operating costs incurred  including all labor  benefits  travel expenses  and the costs of our subcontractors 
we only recognize fees as revenue when the amount to be received is fixed or determinable 
our contracts with the nda allow for a portion of the fees we receive to be paid monthly on account during the year 
the total amount paid on account at the year end cannot exceed a combined of the total base incentive fee available and of the efficiency fee earned 
for the first six months of the contract year  which ends on march  we receive monthly account payments of fees equivalent to of the total available fees for the contract year  although the monthly amount of the base incentive fee may be increased to reflect actual fees earned in the period if mutually agreed 
the contract requires a joint performance review with the nda at the end of the sixth month and ninth month periods of the contract year 
the purpose of the review is to establish a forecast of fees expected to be earned in the year  against which future scheduled monthly fee payments are assessed  and potentially adjusted  to ensure that the total fees paid on account by the end of the contract year will not exceed the contractual limits 
in july  following the end of the contract year  we expect to finalize any earned but unpaid incentive and efficiency fees due from the nda and receive a corresponding final fee payment 
our contracts with the nda are based on an annual funding cycle and incentive plan 
consequently  revenue can vary from year to year depending on the level of annual funding  the nature of performance based incentives negotiated and efficiency fee mechanisms in place 
cost of revenue in our international segment consist primarily of compensation and benefits to employees  travel expenses  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  and costs of goods purchased for use in projects 
the results of project activities and other projects performed outside of north america are also included in our international segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include expenses that are not directly associated with performing nuclear services for our customers 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits for management and administrative personnel  preparing contract bids  office expenses  advisory fees  professional fees  strategic growth initiatives such as research and development  and administrative overhead 
we segregate our sg a expenses into two categories for reporting purposes 
segment sg a reflects costs specifically associated with each of our business segments  such as costs for segment leadership compensation and expenses  specific business development activities  and other costs associated with a specific segment 
corporate sg a reflects costs associated with supporting the entire company including executive management and administrative functions such as accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  and information technology  and other costs required to support the company 
interest expense interest expense includes both cash and accrued interest expense  the amortization of deferred financing costs and fees  and interest paid on outstanding letters of credit 

table of contents other income  net other income  expense net includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments classified as trading securities  interest income  mark to market gains and losses on our derivative contracts and transactional foreign currency gains and losses 
outlook we expect the following factors to affect our results of operations in future periods 
in addition to these factors  please refer to risk factors for additional information on what could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations 
revenue may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
during the year ended december   revenue from our international segment was of our total consolidated revenue 
most of our revenue in our international segment is derived from contracts with the nda in the uk which are denominated in pound sterling 
over the past three months  the pound sterling has held its value at an average exchange rate of 
equity based compensation expense 
we account for equity based compensation payments  including grants to employees  based on the fair values of the equity instruments issued 
as of december   we have options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock and we have  unvested restricted shares of our common stock outstanding 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million  million in  and  respectively  and expect to record compensation expense of million in as a result of these outstanding options and unvested restricted shares 
during  we expect to grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards 
we also incurred non cash compensation expense of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to profit interest units granted in env holdings llc env holdings in connection with the acquisition of envirocare of utah  llc envirocare in and our acquisitions of bng america  llc and duratek  inc in there is no remaining unrecognized compensation expense associated with these units 
capital expenditures 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will range from approximately million to million related mostly to purchases of equipment and property improvements at our facilities 
most of our capital expenditures of approximately million in related to building improvements at approximately six of our existing facilities  the purchase of transportation containers for our clive facility operations  the finalization of phase i of the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system oracle ebs r  and the purchase of computer hardware and software 
we had capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively 
amortization costs related to intangible assets 
we expect non cash amortization costs to remain constant in  provided we do not acquire any significant businesses or intangible assets and foreign exchange rates remain constant 
we incurred approximately million of non cash amortization expense in and million of non cash amortization expense in  related to the intangible assets acquired in  and we expect to incur million of non cash amortization expense in interest expense 
on august   we entered into a new credit facility in the amount of million at a discount rate of 
as a result  the interest rate on our borrowings increased from libor plus to libor plus and included a provision for a libor floor 
based on our outlook for interest rates and our expectations that libor will fluctuate during  we expect our interest expense associated with our new credit facility to 
table of contents increase slightly during from our interest expense for in addition  on august  we also completed a private offering of million in senior notes due at a discount rate of 
we incurred approximately million of interest expense related to these senior notes and we expect to incur million of interest expense related to this notes in we also paid fees to the lenders of approximately million to obtain the new credit agreements and wrote off deferred financing fees of approximately million as a result of retirement of our previous debt 
we expect to recognize approximately million of non cash amortization expense of deferred financing costs in income taxes 
our effective tax rate in of is primarily the result of the realization of income tax expense in the uk  a goodwill impairment charge which is not deductible for tax purposes  an increase of million in our valuation allowance against certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets  and having a small amount of book income 
additional tax expense results from nuclear decommissioning trust earnings being taxed at both the trust and corporate levels 
during the year we also recorded a benefit for domestic and foreign research and development credits 
we anticipate our effective tax rate for  exclusive of any unusual items  will be approximately to 
our effective tax rate for was which was lower than the expected statutory rate primarily due to the effect of research and development credits in the u 
k and in the u 
s as well as the lower statutory tax rate in the uk

liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased million  to million 
this compared to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the prior year

we expect that we will be reimbursed from the trust fund for the work we perform to decommission the plant 
to that extent  investments in the ndt fund are also considered a source of working capital for those operations 
however  in the event that we do not comply with the contractual requirements included in the exelon agreements  we may become subject to additional financial requirements 
these additional financial requirements may take the form of not being able to bill the trust fund for work performed  funding the work on the project through our other cash flows  increasing the letter of credit amount established for this project  or having the letter of credit drawn down by exelon 
our principal needs for liquidity have been  and will continue to be  for working capital  to pay down debt  and for capital expenditures 
we have determined that capital previously allocated for the payment of common stock dividends would be better utilized for debt reduction and reinvesting in the 
table of contents business to support our internal growth

we are required to fund the plan related to our employees of energysolutions eu limited  a wholly owned subsidiary in the uk the plan is currently funded by contributions from us and the employees 
our liquidity is not affected by these contributions as they are only made when we have received the funds from the nda

critical accounting policies this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that other professionals  applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  complex or subjective estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
accounting for the exelon transaction as discussed above  in december  we entered into certain agreements with exelon to dismantle the zion station  including a planning contract under which we were engaged to perform certain preparatory services  with payment contingent upon closing of an asset sale agreement 
although we entered into this contract in december  we postponed the closing of the transaction due to the financial crisis affecting the stock markets at the time  and as a result all costs associated with the execution of the planning phase were also deferred 
the transaction closed on september  after closing  we recognized the costs and the related revenue associated with the planning contract in our consolidated statements of operations  with million in revenue being deferred over the period of d d work 
on the date of the closing of the asset sale agreement  the trust fund investments of approximately million previously held by exelon for the purpose of decommissioning the zion station nuclear power plant were transferred to us and the use of those funds  and any investments returns arising therein  remains restricted solely to that purpose 
the investments are classified as trading securities and as such  the investment gains and losses will be recorded in the income statement as other income or expense 
as part of this transaction  we have assumed exelon cost basis in the investments  for tax purposes  which included an unrealized gain of approximately million at the closing date which resulted in a deferred tax liability of approximately million 
to the extent that the trust fund assets exceed the costs to perform the d d work  we have a contractual obligation to return any excess funds to exelon 
throughout the period over which we perform the d d work  we will assess whether such a contingent liability exists using the measurement thresholds under asc as the trust fund assets that were transferred to us represent a prepayment of fees to perform the d d work  we also recorded deferred revenue  including deferred revenue associated with the planning contract  of million 
revenue recognition throughout the life of the project is based on the proportional performance method using a cost to cost approach 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the shut down nuclear power plant  we became responsible for and assumed the asset retirement obligations for the plant  and we have established and initially measured an aro in accordance with asc subsequent measurement of the aro will follow asc accounting guidance  including the recognition of accretion expense  reassessment of the 
table of contents remaining liability using our estimated costs to complete the d d work plus the original profit margin  and recognition of the aro gain as the obligation is settled 
accretion expense and the aro gain will be recorded within cost of revenue because  through this arrangement  we are providing d d services to a customer 
any change to the aro as a result of cost estimate changes will also be recorded to cost of revenue in the statement of operations 
we also recorded deferred costs to reflect the costs incurred to acquire the future revenue stream 
the deferred cost balance was initially recorded at million  which is the same value as the initial aro  and will be amortized into cost of revenue in the same manner as deferred revenue  using the proportional performance method 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following conditions exist evidence of an agreement with our customer  work has actually been performed  the amount of revenue is fixed or determinable  and collection from our customer is reasonably assured 
federal  commercial and international contracts our services are provided under cost reimbursable plus award or incentive fee  fixed price  and unit rate contracts 
the following describes our policies for these contract types cost reimbursable contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs in accordance with federal acquisition regulations far  cost accounting standards cas or contractual provisions 
if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or cas  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for such costs 
a contract may also provide for award fees or incentive fees in addition to cost reimbursements 
incentive fees are earned if we meet certain contract provisions  including schedule  budget and safety 
monthly assessments are made to measure the amount of revenue earned in accordance with established contract provisions 
award and incentive fees are accrued when estimable and collection is reasonably assured 
fixed price contracts we receive a fixed amount of revenue irrespective of the actual costs we incur 
for fixed price contracts  our revenue are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting using appropriate output measures  where estimable  or on other measures such as proportion of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
unit rate contracts for unit rate contracts  our revenue are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting as units are completed based on contractual unit rates 
accounting for revenue earned under our contracts may require assessments that include an estimate of the amount that has been earned on the contract and are usually based on the volumes that have been processed or disposed  milestones reached or the time that has elapsed under the contract 
each of our contracts is unique with regard to scope  schedule and delivery methodology 
accordingly  each contract is reviewed to determine the most reliable measure of completion for revenue recognition purposes 
input measures such as costs incurred to total contract costs are used only when there are no quantifiable output measures available and represent a reasonable basis for determining the relative status of the project given that  on many contracts  costs are the basis for determining the overall contract value and timing 
certain of our fixed price contracts are for services that are non linear in nature  require complex  non repetitive tasks or involve a non time based scope of work 
in these contracts  the earnings process 
table of contents is not fulfilled upon the achievement of milestones  but rather over the life of the contract 
evaluation of the obligations and customer requirements on these contracts does not produce objective  quantifiable output measures that reflect the earnings process for revenue recognition 
therefore  in these situations  we use a cost to cost approach to determine revenue 
a cost to cost approach accurately reflects our obligations and performance on these contracts  as well as meeting our customers expectations of service being performed 
therefore  we believe that input measures used to measure progress toward completion on certain fixed price projects provide a reasonable surrogate as compared to using output measures 
for the years ended december   and  revenue calculated using a cost to cost approach were million  million and million respectively 
revisions to revenue  cost and profit estimates  or measurements of the extent of progress toward completion  are changes in accounting estimates accounted for in the period of change cumulative catch up method 
contracts typically provide for periodic billings on a monthly basis or based on contract milestones 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent amounts recognized as revenue that have not been billed 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed and collected for which revenue has not been recognized 
we record contract claims and pending change orders  including requests for equitable adjustments reas when collection of revenue is reasonably assured  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
the costs to perform the work related to these claims and pending change orders including reas are included in our financial statements in the period that they are incurred and are included in our estimates of contract profitability 
a provision for estimated losses on individual contracts is recognized in the period in which the losses are identified and includes all estimated direct costs to complete such contracts excluding future general and administrative costs expected to be allocated to the contracts 
monthly assessments are performed on our estimates and changes are made based on the latest information available 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded provision for losses in the amount of million  million  and million  respectively 
lp d contracts our lp d services are provided primarily under unit rate contracts 
revenue is recognized as units of materials are processed or disposed based on the unit prices provided in the contracts 
d d liabilities we have responsibility for the cost to d d our facilities and related equipment  as well as the equipment used at customer sites in our commercial services segment 
these costs are generally paid upon closure of the facilities or disposal of the equipment 
we are also responsible for the cost of monitoring our clive  utah facility over its post closure period 
we have also acquired the shut down nuclear power plant at exelon zion station and assumed the related d d liabilities 
accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations requires us to record the fair value of an aro as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset except for the zion related aro 
we are also required to record a corresponding asset that we depreciate over the life of the asset 
for the zion related aro we do not record an aro asset that depreciates because the underlying tangible assets have no future value 
instead  we have capitalized deferred project costs that will be amortized to cost of revenue as the work is performed 
after the initial measurement of our aros  the aro is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect 
table of contents the passage of time accretion and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the cost basis for our landfill assets and related obligations include landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  environmental groundwater and air monitoring equipment  directly related engineering and design costs and other capital infrastructure costs 
also included in the cost basis of our landfill assets and related obligations are estimates of future costs associated with final landfill capping  closure and post closure monitoring activities 
these costs are described below final capping involves the installation of final cap materials over areas of the landfill where total airspace has been consumed 
we estimate available airspace capacity using aerial and ground surveys and other methods of calculation  based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors 
final capping aros are recorded  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as landfill airspace capacity is permitted for waste disposal activities and the cell liner is constructed 
final capping costs are recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated with the final capping event 
closure involves the remediation of our land surrounding the disposal cell and the disposal of company owned property and equipment 
these are costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but before the site is certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
these costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities 
post closure involves the maintenance and monitoring of our landfill site that has been certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
subsequent to landfill closure  we are required to maintain and monitor our landfill site for a year period 
these maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
post closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post closure activities 
the cost basis for our aros and  if applicable  our aro assets includes costs to decontaminate  disassemble and dispose of equipment and facilities 
we develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel  engineers and accountants 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
we use historical experience  professional engineering judgment and quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations 
we recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work ourselves 
costs for the d d of our facilities and equipment will generally be paid upon the closure of these facilities or the disposal of this equipment 
we are obligated under our license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and our buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site barnwell closure 
under the terms of the atlantic waste compact act and our license with the state of south carolina  we are required to maintain a trust fund to cover the barnwell closure obligation  which limits our obligation to the amount of the trust fund 
we are required to make significant estimates in the determination of our aros and the related assets  if applicable 
our cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities and other 
table of contents d d activities are intended to approximate fair value and are based on our interpretation of the current regulatory requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
where applicable  these cost estimates are based on the amount a third party would charge to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
because final landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations and decontamination and decommissioning obligations are measured using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of the related activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and resulting operations 
changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs  timing or extent of the required future capping  closure  post closure and other d d activities typically result in both i a current adjustment to the recorded liability and asset and ii a change in the liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining life of the asset in accordance with our depreciation policy 
however  for the zion station aro  these charges are recorded directly to cost of revenue in the statement of operations 
a hypothetical increase in the inflation rate would have increased our aros by million 
a hypothetical increase in our cost estimate would have increased our aros by million 
we update our d d and closure and post closure cost estimates either annually or more frequently if changes in the underlying conditions occur 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations and burial rates 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on our estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill as of december  and  we had recorded million and million of goodwill related to domestic and foreign acquisitions 
goodwill related to the acquisitions of foreign entities is translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
the related translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of translation losses related to goodwill denominated in foreign currencies 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an impairment test on goodwill annually  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our annual testing date is april for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment  goodwill is allocated to each of our reporting units which are federal services  commercial services  lp d and international 
these reporting units were determined based on our internal management reporting and organizational structure 
goodwill is assigned to each of these reporting units based on which of the reporting units derive the benefits of an acquired company 
if multiple reporting units benefit from an acquisition  goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on an allocation of revenue between the reporting units at the acquisition date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net revenue and operating expenses  based primarily on pricing  market segment share and general economic conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
we performed our annual impairment test as of april  and based on step of the analysis  except for federal services  each of the reporting units fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value 
based on step  we determined that we were required to perform step for the federal services 
table of contents reporting unit 
we concluded that the carrying value of our federal services reporting unit was impaired 
we measured the fair value of the federal services unit by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis  and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation 
the discounted cash flow analysis calculated the fair value of the federal services unit using management business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next five years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
we also used a weighted average discount rate of for the analysis 
other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the profitability of our federal services unit and its working capital effects 
based on our step analysis  we concluded that the carrying value of our federal services reporting unit was impaired 
prior to the goodwill impairment charge  the federal services reporting unit had goodwill of million 
as a result of our impairment test  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of factors culminating in the impairment included continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment and lower forecasted growth 
the significant factors that we considered in determining the fair value of our federal services reporting unit included the future impact of contracts currently in place  the existence of renewal options on existing contracts  follow on contracts related to existing contracts  outstanding proposals with federal services customers  known future requests for proposals and expected long term growth in the federal services business that approximates inflation 
in determining the fair value of the reporting unit we probability weight the future business opportunities based on our internal assessments 
however  some of the proposals are for very substantial contract awards and either winning or losing those bids can have a significant impact on our fair value calculations 
there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  indicating that impairment exists in any of our reporting units  however deterioration of market conditions accompanied of a decrease in our share of government funded contracts could potentially result in future impairment losses within our federal services reporting unit 
the impairment charge did not impact our cash position  operating cash flow or debt covenants 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
we assess the useful lives of other intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimate of an intangible asset remaining useful life is changed  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer relationships  licenses and permits  technology  and non compete agreements 
customer relationships  which include the fair value of acquired customer contracts  were evaluated for each operating segment using a discounted cash flow methodology and are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of two to twelve years 
estimated future cash flows for each operating segment were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
licenses and permits were evaluated for each licensed facility using a replacement cost methodology 
also  due to the unique characteristics of the envirocare permits  we also included an opportunity cost reflecting an estimate of earnings that would be lost if we had to replace the licenses and permits as opposed to having acquired them 
licenses and permits are either amortized over the definite terms of the related agreements or over the remaining useful lives of the related intangible asset  typically to years 
estimates of replacement costs were determined by management taking into consideration the cost of labor and other costs needed to meet regulatory requirements to obtain and maintain the licenses or permits 
estimates of opportunity cost were 
table of contents determined by management after considering estimated cash flows for the business generated with the licenses and permits offset by contribution asset charges for other assets of the business that also contribute to cash flow generation 
technology and non compete agreements were evaluated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
intangible technology assets are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of to years and non compete agreements are amortized over the terms of the contracts 
estimated future cash flows for each technology and non compete agreement were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value 
share based compensation expense we recognized shared based compensation costs in the income statement over the instruments vesting periods based on the instruments fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of the grant using an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective 
key assumptions used in the valuation included the expected term of the equity award taking into account both the contractual term of the award  the effects of employees expected exercise and post vesting termination behavior  expected volatility  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award 
in our share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and restricted stock that vest over time based on service and performance 
for time based stock options and restricted stock  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period from the vesting commencement date using the straight line method 
for performance based stock options and restricted stock compensation  expense is recognized over the vesting period beginning at the grant date if it is probable that performance targets will be achieved 
if prior to the performance measurement date  it is no longer probable that the performance targets will be achieved  the expense related to the grant will be adjusted accordingly and prior recognized compensation expense may be reversed 
also  if at the performance measurement date the performance targets are not achieved  the expense related to the grants will be adjusted to the earned amounts and compensation expense will also be adjusted accordingly 
in and  certain members of senior management were granted profit interest units in env holdings llc  in consideration for services rendered to us 
these units entitle the holders to distributions from env holdings 
certain units vested immediately upon grant and others vested over periods up to three years 
these profit interest units are not convertible into common stock of energysolutions  inc or any other equity security of energysolutions  inc however  because these grants of profit interest units were made for services rendered to us  we recorded compensation expenses in connection with these grants 
we recorded compensation expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which represents the portion of the fair value of these units that vested in those periods 
at december  there is no remaining unrecognized compensation expense associated with these units 
we have options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares and unvested restricted shares of  as of december  we estimate that we will recognize compensation expense related to the issuance of these awards of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our estimate of fair value for the stock options was made using the black scholes model based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant  volatility of to  risk free 
table of contents interest rate of to per year  and expected life of years to years 
we determined the volatility rate by reference to volatility rates used by certain of our public industry peers since we do not have an established trading history of our common stock 
we are currently using the simplified method to calculate expected holding periods  which is based on the average term of the options and the weighted average graded vesting period 
income taxes our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
due to the amount of tax expense relative to the amount of pretax book income the rate is higher than the blended statutory rate 
the tax expense is primarily due to the realization of income and tax expense in the uk  a goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for tax purposes  and the increase of million in our valuation allowance against certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
additional tax expense is also recorded as a result of tax recorded on earnings generated by the ndt fund at both the trust and the corporate level 
during the year ended december   we also recorded a benefit for domestic and foreign research and development credits 
all of the domestic benefit from the research credit was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of legislation that was enacted 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate in  exclusive of any unusual items  will be approximately to 
we account for income taxes in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance for income taxes 
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the us  the uk  and by various other government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the us during the year ended december   we recognized adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits of million  primarily related to various tax positions in the uk and in the uk during the years ended december   and  we made income tax payments of million  million  and million respectively 
during  the internal revenue service continued its examination of the consolidated us tax returns for the short tax period from november  through december  and the tax year ended december  it is not anticipated that the exam will result in any material adjustments to the amount of taxes previously recorded 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which approximately million will impact our annual effective tax rate in future years 
these tax benefits were accounted for under guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company and its us subsidiaries are subject to us federal and state income tax 
as discussed above the company is currently in the final stages of multiple year examinations by federal taxing authorities 
the company does not anticipate a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefits balance with respect to current tax examinations in the next months  although the timing of the resolution and or the closure on audits is highly uncertain 
disclosure of impact of recently issued accounting standards variable interests entities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities vie and guidance to improve financial reporting disclosures by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this guidance requires an entity to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether the entity has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits 
table of contents from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
they also require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary  and amend the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about an entity involvement in a vie 
the new accounting standard on consolidation of vies became effective for annual reporting beginning after november  we adopted this guidance as of january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
this guidance is effective for us on january  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the company results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued accounting guidance improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of the level and level provisions as of january  did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance had no impact in our consolidated financial statements as it is disclosure only in nature 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk relates to changing interest rates 
as of december   we had outstanding variable rate long term debt of million  of which million is currently due within the next year 
under the terms of our senior secured credit facility  we are required to maintain one or more hedge agreements bearing interest at a fixed rate in the aggregate notional amount of no less than of the outstanding principal amounts of our long term debt 
since the outstanding balances under our senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and totaled million as of september   which is of our total outstanding term loans  we were not required to enter into new hedge agreements 
however  we retained the collar interest rate agreement required under our former credit facilities for the aggregate notional amount of million until its maturity date on january  as of december   the fair value liability of our interest rate collar agreement was approximately million 
a hypothetical interest rate change of on our senior secured credit facility would have changed interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
in addition  changes in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our long term obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding term loans with carrying amounts of million with an approximate fair value of million 

table of contents we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in the uk as well as to other foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure arises primarily from the translation or re measurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in pound sterling  and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december   would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million and a change in gross profit of approximately million  primarily due to pound sterling denominated exposures 
we maintain a ndt fund to fund the decommissioning of the zion station nuclear plants 
our ndt fund is reflected at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had outstanding net investments with carrying amounts of million with an approximate fair value of million 
the mix of securities in the ndt fund is designed to provide returns to be used to fund zion station d d work and to compensate us for inflationary increases in d d costs 
however  the equity securities in the ndt fund are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  and the value of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in rates of basis points would have changed the fair value of the ndt fund investments by approximately million
