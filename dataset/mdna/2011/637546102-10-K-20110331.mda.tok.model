summary of consolidated results of operations condensed revenue and income information follows year ended december  premium earned investment income realized investment gains other income total revenues net income net income per share for the year ended december  total revenues were  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of 
earned premium increases in the p c segment as well as the increase in net realized investment gains were the primary contributing factors to the increase in total revenue for over the company ended with net income totaling  compared to  in the company ended with net income per share of compared to in an increase in policyholder benefits was the primary factor contributing to the decrease in net income 
for the year  policyholder benefits were of earned premium compared to in  an increase of percentage points 
increased accident and health claims in the life segment contributed approximately one percentage point to the increase while increased homeowners and auto claims in the p c segment account for most of the remaining increase 
results of operations for years ended december  and the company ended with premiums earned totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
premium revenue is generated from our two operating segments p c segment and life segment 
the p c segment accounts for approximately of total premium revenue while our life segment contributes the remaining 
the p c segment operates in personal lines insurance products primarily generating premium revenue from dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowners policies 
our life segment produces premium revenue primarily from whole life  accident and critical illness insurance policies 
net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  we currently hold  in company owned life insurance coli 
the change in value related to this investment led to investment income totaling  in compared to  for the same period last year 
the reduction in coli income was the primary reason for the overall decrease in investment income 
invested assets were up at december  compared to december  the increase in invested assets  primarily in fixed income investments  led to higher interest income from the portfolio and partially offset the decrease in income from coli 
net realized investment gains totaled  in compared to  in the primary reason for the increase was favorable market conditions coupled with an increase in sales of securities in the p c portfolio 
the most significant contributions were from the sale of four bonds and three common stocks totaling  and  respectively 
the realized gains from these seven securities accounted for approximately of the increase in compared to other income was  as of december  compared to  for the same period last year  a  increase 
other income consists primarily of billing  payment and policy fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies in the p c segment as well as miscellaneous income 
the primary reason for the  increase was an increase in fee income related to a rise in policy issuance in the automobile program in the p c segment during policyholder benefits paid or provided increased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
policyholder benefits as a percentage of net premiums earned totaled for the year in compared to in the primary reason for the  increase was higher claims activity in the p c segment associated with an increase in fire related losses primarily homeowners lines of business coupled with increase claims in the auto line of business 
fire losses incurred in the homeowners programs totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in fire losses incurred in compared to fire losses incurred in in the above mentioned lines of business accounted for of the overall increase in policyholder benefits costs 
in addition  the personal lines automobile program ended with incurred losses and incurred loss adjustment expenses of  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of  the auto program also experienced significant revenue growth during the year  partially contributing to the increased frequency of claims 
however  the loss and adjustment expense ratio increased over percentage points in compared to to stem losses in the auto program  we implemented significant rate increases in late which had an immediate impact of decreasing new business production and is expected to ultimately decrease the loss ratio on the program 
the previously mentioned increases in policyholder benefit expense were partially offset by a decline in wind losses related to storm activity in the p c segment 
although both and were impacted by ten non hurricane catastrophic weather related events  losses from these storms totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the same period last year 
the primary factor contributing to the increase in general expenses was an increase in litigation related defense costs associated with the company s sale of an investment in mobile attic in taxes  licenses and fees were  in  up compared to  for the same period last year 
taxes  licenses and fees were of premiums earned for the year compared to in an increase in premium revenue in the auto program was a primary factor contributing to the increase in tax expense

the company incurred income tax expense totaling  compared to  in income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes was in compared to in the most significant factor contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate was a decline in income from company owned life insurance 
due to the increase in policyholder benefit expenses as well as an increase in taxes  licenses and fees  the company ended with net income of  down from  for the same period last year 
stockholder equity and book value per share stockholders equity for the year ended december  was  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the change in stockholders equity is composed of dividends paid to shareholders of  and net income of  as well as accumulated other comprehensive income  primarily increases in accumulated unrealized capital gains  totaling  and unrealized losses on interest rate swap totaling  year end book value per share  defined as stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding of  was at december  compared to at december  industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s two operating segments life segment  property and casualty segment and holding company level expenses is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance the property and casualty segment composed of total premium revenue in compared to in the property and casualty segment is primarily composed of dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowners lines of business 
the life segment composed of premium revenue in compared to in with revenue produced primarily from life insurance products 
the following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the company along with non insurance related information primarily administration expenses associated with the insurance holding company 
life and accident and health insurance operations our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing of total insurance premium revenue in and in premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below amounts in thousands revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense current deferred net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  nsic premium accounted for of total consolidated premium revenue for as mentioned above  nsic operates using two primary methods of distribution home service employee agents and independent agents 
while the company has used the traditional home service distribution method since its founding in  the independent agent distribution method has become the largest source of renewal business and new business production over the past decade 
for  the home service and independent agent distribution methods accounted for and  respectively of nsic premium revenue 
nsic ended with premium revenue of  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
the  decrease in premium revenue was primarily due to the decline in ordinary business related to the home service distribution method 
premium revenue declined in compared to the same period last year 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in a h premium revenue produced by the independent agent distribution method 
net investment income totaled  as of december  compared to  for the same period last year 
investment income in nsic is generated from securities held in our investment portfolio as well as mortgage and policy loan interest 
investment income remained virtually unchanged increasing  in compared to nsic ended with net realized investment gains totaling  compared to  in the primary reason for the improved results in the current year was the lack of other than temporary impairment losses compared to the  in other than temporary impairment losses recognized during policyholder benefit expenses increased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the increase was an increase in claims incurred related to supplemental accident and health claim benefits in compared to general and administrative expenses decreased  while deferred policy acquisition costs dac increased  in compared to one reason for the decline in general and administrative expenses was the absence of a bonus accrual in compared to  which accounted for approximately of the decrease 
in addition  software expenses in the life segment decreased  compared to the same period last year and accounted for another of the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year 
life segment incurred income tax expenses totaled  compared to  in income tax expense increased due to the impact of the small life deduction on capital gains 
nsic ended with a year to date net loss of  compared to net income of  for the same period last year 
the decrease in premium revenue coupled with the increase in policyholder benefit expense  deferred policy acquisition costs and tax expense were the primary reasons for the net loss in compared to the net income in property casualty operations property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing and of our total premium revenue in and  respectively 
premium revenues and operating income for the p c segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees income before income taxes income tax expense current deferred net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty segment premium revenue for was  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of 
the primary reasons for the increase in premium revenue in compared to were the growth of the automobile line of business in addition to moderate rate increases related to our property programs in our largest states 
production of premium revenue in the p c segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowner lines of business 
the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business net premium earned of npe net premium earned of npe line of business dwelling fire allied lines homeowners ocean marine private passenger automobile commercial automobile in our fire allied lines and homeowners lines of business  we have slowed our rate of growth through a combination of rate increases  stricter underwriting standards and fewer appointments of new agents 
these efforts have been undertaken in an effort to improve underwriting profitability  particularly in our homeowners line of business 
the full effect of these efforts was not realized in as only our dwelling fire allied lines program produced an underwriting profit 
however  we expect the changes implemented  while continuing to slow top line revenue growth should lead to improved underwriting results in future periods 
also  during  we experienced rapid growth in our personal lines auto program 
this program is composed primarily of non standard auto policies with the largest concentration of business in the state of louisiana 
due to early unfavorable underwriting results  we implemented significant rate increases in louisiana in the second half of the rate adjustments will slow the production of new business in louisiana going forward but is expected to help reduce underwriting losses 
net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in investment income in the p c segment was primarily attributable to decline in investment income associated with the investment of the cash value of company owned life insurance coli 
investment income from coli totaled  in compared to  in the p c segment ended with realized capital gains totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
the most significant contributions were from the sale of four bonds and three common stocks totaling  and  respectively 
the realized gains from these seven securities accounted for approximately of the increase in compared to the p c segment was not impacted by the write down of other than temporary impairments in  however  other than temporary impairment losses totaled  in for information regarding management s method of determining investment impairment  please see note other income was  in compared to  for the same period last year  a  increase 
other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies as well as miscellaneous income 
the primary reason for the  increase was policy fee income related to the automobile program 
the fees associated with the automobile business totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in policy fees associated with the automobile line of business accounted for of the total increase in other income in compared to policyholder benefit expenses were  in  up  from  for the same period last year 
the primary reasons for the increase were fire losses in the homeowners lines of business as well as the surge in claims frequency related to the growth of the automobile program 
fire losses incurred in in the homeowners line of business totaled  a increase from fire losses incurred during which totaled  the personal lines automobile program ended with incurred losses and incurred loss adjustment expenses of  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of  the auto program also experienced significant revenue growth during the year partially contributing to the increased frequency of claims 
however  the loss and adjustment expense ratio increase over percentage points in compared to in order to stem losses in the auto program  we implemented significant rate increases in late which had an immediate impact of decreasing new business production and is expected to decrease the loss ratio on the program 
partially offsetting the previously mentioned increases in policyholder benefit expense was a decline in wind losses related to storm activity in the p c segment 
although both and were impacted by ten non hurricane catastrophic weather related events  losses from these storms totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
during  tornado and storm related frequency was below levels we experienced throughout although the p c segment experienced losses from ten weather related events classified as catastrophes during and  incurred losses from the current year storms totaled  compared to  in the prior year  a decrease 
the average severity per claim related to the ten non hurricane catastrophes affecting the p c companies during and totaled approximately  and  respectively per claim 
the p c segment continued to be involved in litigation pertaining to claims from hurricane katrina which impacted our coverage areas in louisiana and mississippi in august during  the cumulative claims associated with hurricane katrina breached the  million upper limit of the reinsurance agreement in effect during as of december   cumulative claims incurred related to hurricane katrina exceeded the reinsurance upper limit by  although the reinsurance for this catastrophe has been exhausted and the ultimate outcome of the remaining open claims is unknown  the company believes it maintains adequate reserves for the open claims based on information available at the present time 
during  the p c segment experienced adverse development related to claims from hurricane ike which impacted our coverage areas in september cumulative incurred losses related to hurricane ike totaled  as of december  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of  the company has met its catastrophe reinsurance deductible with regard to ike and is still well within the upper limits of reinsurance coverage for this hurricane covering of the amounts incurred and therefore expects a minimal additional net development with regard to this hurricane 
there was no significant change in deferred policy acquisition costs which totaled  in of premium revenue compared to  in of premium revenue 
deferred policy acquisition cost consists of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs  primarily commissions 
commission expense for totaled of premium revenue compared to of premium revenue in commission expenses totaled  in compared to  in  a 
increase 
during  a new profit sharing bonus calculation was implemented which reduced commission expense and led to the comparable and virtually unchanged results between and the prior year 
general and administrative expenses totaled  or of premium revenue in compared to  or of premium revenue  in the primary reason for the decline in general and administrative expenses was the absence of a bonus accrual in compared to  accrued in insurance taxes  licenses and fees were  in compared to  for the same period last year 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees were of premium revenue in compared to in an increase in the mix of business in states with higher premium taxes was the primary factor leading to the increase in taxes  licenses and fees 
the p c segment ended with income tax expense of  compared to  in the effective tax rate for was compared to in primarily due to less income from tax free bonds and tax free income from coli in compared to the combined ratio was in compared to in the increase in fire losses in the dwelling fire and homeowners lines of business combined with the increase in incurred losses in the automobile program adversely impacted the combined ratio in property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past two years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe  however prohibitive catastrophe reinsurance costs associated with maintaining lower deductibles prevent us from further mitigating hurricane risks 
during  the p c segment experienced an increase of one percentage point in the combined ratio 
the primary reasons for the increase were a  increase in fire related losses primarily in the homeowners line of business as well as the  increase in losses incurred related to the automobile program 
however  the negative impact of these claim expenses was partially offset by the  decrease in tornado and storm related losses incurred in the dwelling fire program in compared to non insurance operations revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit current deferred net loss the non insurance operations of the company consist of our parent company  the national security group  inc the national security group has no material sources of revenue and relies almost entirely on dividends from subsidiaries to pay expenses 
dividends from subsidiaries are subject to insurance department approval and are subject to statutory restrictions 
dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financials included herein 
the expenses of the group consist of expenses associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the single most significant recurring expense of the group is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of two trust preferred securities offerings  the first being  issued in the december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries following the hurricanes of and total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in was  compared to  in defense cost related to matters disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements  was the most significant factor impacting the increase in general expenses 
investments the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of standard and poor s bond portfolio ratings s p or equivalent ratings of total bond portfolio aaa aa aa aa a a a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade a summary of debt and equity securities available for sale with unrealized losses as of december  along with related fair value  aggregated by length of time that the investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position follows dollars in thousands december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross total fair unrealized fair unrealized fair unrealized securities in a value losses value losses value losses loss position fixed maturities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies equity securities other than temporary impairments and credit quality at december   of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade 
management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position 
no otti were recorded for the year ended december  for the year ended december    in otti was recorded by the company 
of the securities in loss positions  management believes based on current information  that no ultimate loss will be realized on the securities 
most unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio are interest rate and market driven as opposed to credit quality driven 
the company has no material direct exposure to sub prime mortgage loans 
with respect to equity securities in a loss position  management evaluated financial information on each company and reviewed analyst reports from at least two independent sources 
based on a review of the available financial information  the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the company s intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered  it was determined that the remaining securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments 
the amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at december   by contractual maturity  are as follows 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
dollars in thousands amortized fair available for sale securities cost value due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total held to maturity securities due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total the amortized cost and aggregate fair values of investments in securities at december  and december  are as follows dollars in thousands december  gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value available for sale securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total fixed maturities equity securities total held to maturity securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total dollars in thousands december  gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value available for sale securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total fixed maturities equity securities total held to maturity securities mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies total mortgage backed security investments the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include residential mortgage backed securities rmbs of million and million at amortized value at december  and respectively 
we own no commercial mortgage backed securities 
we also have no material direct exposure in sub prime mortgage loans in our private label rmbs portfolio 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
as for the composition of the rmbs portfolio  agency mortgage backed securities compose and of the rmbs portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the rmbs portfolio is composed of private label mortgage backed securities 
these securities consist primarily of conventional and year loans with an average borrower fico score of we own no mortgage backed securities with direct exposure to subprime loans and less than of the rmbs portfolio is composed of loans subject to rate resets 
three securities in the private label mortgage backed security portfolio are rated below investment grade and compose less than of total invested assets 
investment portfolio income investment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended december  and follows year ended december  net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes change in accumulated net unrealized gains before income taxes the decrease in current yield on investments is primarily due to a decrease in average yields on new investments in corporate bonds in compared to coupled with a higher allocation of tax free investments 
tax free investments typically yield less than comparable taxable securities but result in lowering the overall effective tax rate of the company 
the total return on investments consists of return of current interest and dividend payments current yield components plus realized and unrealized appreciation or depreciation in asset market values 
due to a second consecutive year of improving market values on fixed income investments coupled with a capital gain return of on the equity portfolio  we had a total return on investments 
the total return consisted of a return from current interest and dividend payments and a total return from increases in market values of securities 
the total return in was down compared to the total return experienced in primarily due to an overall more stable market in the results for were significantly impacted by improvements in the corporate and mortgage backed security market from the meltdown experienced in repurchase agreements the company maintains a repurchase agreement under which the policy requires minimum of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral 
cash collateral received is invested in short term investments 
the repurchase investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid 
the company does not have any reverse repurchase agreements 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment  or effective maturities  will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that cash flow provided from operating activities was  in compared to  in cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by declines in underwriting performance for both the p c and life subsidiaries 
specifically  losses from the homeowners and auto lines of business were the most significant factors contributing to the decline in underwriting performance 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by recoveries of reinsurance receivables arising from losses stemming from hurricanes gustav and ike which occurred during an improvement in underwriting results in our property and casualty insurance operations in  largely related to no hurricane activity  was the primary source of operating cash flow in in a typical year  cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities tend to have an inverse relationship 
in  a decline in underwriting profits decreased cash from operations resulting in a reduction in the cash available to invest   in compared to  in in  improved underwriting results in the property and casualty subsidiaries increased cash from operations 
this increased cash from operations was then used to increase investments leading to a net increase in cash used in investing activities 
the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects a decrease in cash used in financing activities of  and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect cash provided of  from a short term line of credit and shareholder dividends paid of  the following table reflects the anticipated cash flows associated with our short and long term contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable debt obiligations interest on debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves future life insurance obligations long term debt  consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities  is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity 
interest on long term debt is calculated using the interest rates in effect at december  for each issue 
interest on long term debt is accrued and settled quarterly 
therefore  the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above 
these calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments 
for additional information regarding long term debt and interest on long term debt  please see note  notes payable and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves  which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses  are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of nsic s obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary national security fire casualty in and thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s property and casualty claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements regarding contingencies  the company is involved in litigation related to the sale of mobile attic  inc as is customarily discussed in the management discussion and analysis  the company s liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company maintains minimal liquidity in order to maximize liquidity within the insurance subsidiaries in order to support ongoing insurance operations 
the company has no separate source of revenue other than dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries 
also  dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and  therefore  are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries 
in the event of a substantial adverse judgment related to the litigation against the company  we could face limitations in our ability to fund shareholder dividends and service interest payments on outstanding debt 
the uncertainty related to the pending litigation could also temporarily impair our ability to raise new debt or equity capital until this matter is resolved 
the company is vigorously defending the allegations raised in this litigation and is unable to determine a potential liability at this time which limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact on our liquidity and capital resources 
the company filed a claim for coverage under a liability policy having aggregate limits of  but the insurer has denied coverage and no provision for any recovery has been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
the company s subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs  claims  other policy benefits  interest expense  general expenses  and dividends to the company 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities  calls  and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of readily marketable securities  which can be sold for cash 
the company s business is concentrated primarily in the southeastern united states 
accordingly  unusually severe storms or other disasters in the southeastern united states might have a more significant effect on the company than on a more geographically diversified insurance company 
however  the company maintains a catastrophe reinsurance program to limit the effect of such catastrophic events on the company s financial condition 
the company deductible under the terms of the reinsurance contract totals million  however  the company maintains cash and short term investments in sufficient amounts to cover the deductible payment in the event of a catastrophic event 
except as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
an operating line of credit was obtained by the holding company in december of to allow flexibility with respect to cash management at the holding company level 
the outstanding balance at december  was  off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance deferred policy acquisition costs income taxes fair values of financial instruments claim liabilities recognition of revenue contingencies recently issued accounting standards reinsurance risk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements 
the reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts 
although the reinsurance protects our company in the event a loss penetrates into a particular reinsurance agreement  ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due 
we record an asset for reinsurance recoverable on the financials for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible 
if we discover an amount due may not be received  we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
reinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed  for any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property and casualty segment holds a catastrophe contract which covers losses related to a catastrophic event with multiple policyholders affected 
in the event a catastrophe exceeds the million retention stated in the contract  reinsurers will reimburse the company co pay of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses paid up to million layer one and layer two of the contract 
if losses exceed million  the contract allows for reimbursement of losses and loss adjustment expenses up to million 
any losses above the million upper limit are the responsibility of our company 
the contract in place during also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event if needed 
the contract provided protection up to at least a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
in  catastrophe reinsurance premiums totaled  ceded compared to  in catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the earned premium of the covered lines of business 
the reduction in ceded premium in is attributable to a decline in the premium base and a decline in the rate applied 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability 
for more information regarding reinsurance  please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions  premium taxes  and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december  and  the company recorded  and  respectively  as an asset for dac in the financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  please see note to our financial statements 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
the company evaluates all tax positions taken on its us federal income tax return 
no material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the company fair values of financial instruments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements 
further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations 
claim liabilities property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
the reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review and actuarial sign off performed at year end 
at december  and  the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  and  respectively  a  increase 
claim activity from fire related losses in the dwelling fire and homeowners lines of business during combined with increased automobile claims were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
we believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our financial statements 
recognition of revenue life insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due 
property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force and is reported as a liability 
prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and is reported as an asset 
contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from  but not limited to  litigation  claims  assessments  fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under item a 
however  in order to provide information to our investors  we have elected to provide information related to market risk 
the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the s p with regard to market risk 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately  certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note and in the consolidated financial statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
