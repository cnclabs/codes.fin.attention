our revenues are advertising revenues  consisting primarily of listing fees paid by travel companies  entertainment companies and local businesses to advertise their offers on travelzoo s media properties 
revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising in the us listing fees are based on audience reach  placement  number of listings  number of impressions  number of click throughs  number of referrals  or percentage of the face value of vouchers sold 
insertion orders are typically for periods between one month and twelve months and are not automatically renewed 
merchant agreements for local deals advertisers are typically for the period of the voucher redemption period 
we have two operating segments based on geographic regions north america and europe 
north america consists of our operations in canada and the us europe consists of our operations in france  germany  spain  and the uk for the year ended december   our operations in europe accounted for of revenues and our operations in north america accounted for of revenues 
when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the company  management focuses on the following financial and non financial indicators growth of number of subscribers of the company s newsletters and page views of the homepages of the travelzoo websites  operating margin  growth in revenues in the absolute and relative to the growth in reach of the company s publications  and revenue per employee as a measure of productivity 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and liabilities to former stockholders 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin for revenue recognition 
we recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
if fixed fee advertising is displayed over a term greater than one month  revenues are recognized ratably over the period as described below 
the majority of insertion orders have terms that begin and end in a quarterly reporting period 
in the cases where at the end of a quarterly reporting period the term of an insertion order is not complete  the company recognizes revenue for the period by pro rating the total arrangement fee to revenue and deferred revenue based on a measure of proportionate performance of its obligation under the insertion order 
the company measures proportionate performance by the number of placements delivered and undelivered as of the reporting date 
the company uses prices stated on its internal rate card for measuring the value of delivered and undelivered placements 
fees for variable fee advertising arrangements are recognized based on the number of impressions displayed  number of clicks delivered  or number of referrals generated during the period 
under these policies  no revenue is recognized unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed reasonably assured 
the company evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider an insertion order signed by the advertiser or its agency to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when the advertising has been displayed and  if applicable  the click throughs have been delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are standard 
collection is deemed reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the advertiser 
collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect that the advertiser will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
collection is deemed not reasonably assured when a advertiser is perceived to be in financial distress  which may be evidenced by weak industry conditions  a bankruptcy filing  or previously billed amounts that are past due 
revenues from advertising sold to advertisers through agencies are reported at the net amount billed to the agency 
during the third quarter of  the company started selling vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas and restaurants 
the company earns a fee for acting as an agent in these transactions which is recorded on a net basis and is included in revenue upon completion of the voucher sale 
the company applies a return allowance for potential voucher refunds 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the creditworthiness of the advertiser  the economic conditions of the advertiser s industry  and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 

table of contents liability to former stockholders on october   we announced a program under which we would make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
we account for the cost of this program as an expense recorded in general and administrative expenses and a current accrued liability 
the ultimate total cost of this program is not reliably estimable because it is based on the ultimate number of valid requests received and future levels of the company s common stock price 
the company s common stock price affects the liability because the amount of cash payments under the program is based in part on the recent level of the stock price at the date valid requests are received 
we do not know how many of the requests for shares originally received by travelzoo 
com corporation in were valid 
we believe that only a portion of such requests were valid 
in order to receive payment under the program  a person is required to establish that such person validly held shares in travelzoo 
com corporation 
since the total cost of the program is not reliably estimable  the amount of expense recorded in a period is equal to the actual number of valid claims received during the period multiplied by i the number of shares held by each individual former stockholder and ii the applicable settlement price based on the recent price of our common stock at the date the claim is received as stipulated by the program 
requests are generally paid within days of receipt 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further details about our liabilities to former stockholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenues  the results of our operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income and expenses  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss for the year ended december   we reported income from continuing operations of approximately million 
as of december   we had retained earnings of approximately million 
our operating margin increased to for the year ended december  from in the main reason for the increase in operating margin is our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to prior year see operating expenses below 
this was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to prior year see cost of revenues below 

table of contents we do not know what our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be in future periods 
our cost of revenues will increase if the number of searches performed on fly 
com increases because we pay a fee based on the number of searches performed on fly 
com 
our cost of revenues will increase if the total face value of vouchers that we sell through local deals increases because we pay credit card fees based the total face value of vouchers sold 
we expect fluctuations of cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
we do not know what our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods 
increased competition in our industry may require us to increase advertising for our brand and for our products 
increases in the average cost of acquiring new subscribers see subscriber acquisition below may result in an increase of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
we may decide to accelerate our subscriber acquisition for various strategic and tactical reasons and  as a result  increase our marketing expenses 
we may see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign that will result in an increase of marketing expenses 
further  we expect our strategy to replicate our business model in selected foreign markets see growth strategy below to result in a significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we expect fluctuations of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
we do not know what our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods 
there may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations 
we expect our headcount to continue to increase in the future 
the company s headcount is one of the main drivers of general and administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect our absolute general and administrative expenses to continue to increase 
we expect our continued expansion into foreign markets to result in a significant additional increase in our general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may also fluctuate depending on the number of requests received related to a program under which the company intends to make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period

we launched fly 
com in february as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  none of our customers accounted for or more of our revenue in the years ended december  or orbitz worldwide accounted for of our total revenues in the year ended december  no other advertisers accounted for or more of our total revenues during the years ended december  the agreements with these 
table of contents advertisers are in the form of multiple insertion orders from groups of entities under common control 
although we did not have any advertisers that accounted for or more of our total revenues during the years ended december  and  it is possible that we may have a advertiser or advertisers that account for or more of our total revenues in future years because management believes there is a high concentration in the online travel agency industry 
management believes that our ability to increase revenues in the future depends mainly on the following factors our ability to increase our advertising rates  our ability to sell more advertising to existing advertisers  our ability to increase the number of advertisers  our ability to develop new revenue streams  and our ability to launch new products 
we believe that we can increase our advertising rates only if the reach of our publications increases 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the reach of our publications 
we believe that we can sell more advertising only if the market for online advertising continues to grow and if we can maintain or increase our market share 
we believe that the market for online advertising continues to grow 
we do not know if we will be able to maintain or increase our market share 
we have historically increased the number of advertisers in each year since inception 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the number of advertisers in the future 
we do not know if we will have market acceptance of our new products 
our goal is to increase our advertising rates at least once a year in each market  preferably as of january of each year 
we increased advertising rates on select listings in the us on january  and january  due in part to the increase in the reach of our publications 
we did not increase our advertising rates in the us on january  and due to intense competition in our industry 
we increased advertising rates on select listings in europe on november   may   january   january  and april  due in part to the increase in the reach of our publications 
in the us and europe  we were not able to increase advertising rates on all listings in due to intense competition in our industry 
we intend to review advertising rates and consider increases once a year as of january however  there is no assurance that there will be increases of advertising rates 
depending on the level of competition in the industry and the condition of the online advertising market  we may decide not to increase our advertising rates in all or certain markets

for the years ended december    and  advertising expenses accounted for   and respectively  of sales and marketing expenses 
advertising activities during these three year periods consisted primarily of online advertising 
our goal is to increase our revenues from advertising sales 
one important factor that drives our revenues is our advertising rates 
we believe that we can increase our advertising rates only if the reach of our publications increases 
in order to increase the reach of our publications  we have to acquire a significant number of new subscribers in every quarter and continue to promote our brand 
one significant factor that impacts our advertising expenses is the average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber 
we believe that the average cost per acquisition depends mainly on the advertising rates which we pay for media buys  our ability to manage our subscriber acquisition efforts successfully  and the degree of competition in our industry 
in may  we began operations in the uk in  we began operations in canada  germany  and spain 
in  we began operations in france 
the continuing build up of our business in europe is expected to result in a relatively high level of sales and marketing expense in the foreseeable future

table of contents we expect our headcount to continue to increase in the future 
the company s headcount is one of the main drivers of general and administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase 
our strategy to replicate our business model in foreign markets is expected to result in a significant additional increase in our general and administrative expenses 
subscriber acquisition the table set forth below provides for each quarter in   and  an analysis of our average cost for acquisition of new subscribers for our travelzoo top newsletter and our newsflash e mail alert service for our north america and europe operating segments 
the table includes the following data average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber this is the quarterly costs of consumer marketing programs whose purpose was primarily to acquire new subscribers  divided by total new subscribers added during the quarter 
new subscribers total new subscribers who signed up for at least one of our e mail publications throughout the quarter 
this is an unduplicated subscriber number  meaning a subscriber who signed up for two or more of our publications is only counted once 
subscribers removed from list subscribers who were removed from our lists throughout the quarter either as a result of their requesting removal  or based on periodic list maintenance after we determined that the e mail address was likely no longer valid 
balance this is the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter  computed by taking the previous quarter s subscriber balance  adding new subscribers during the current quarter  and subtracting subscribers removed from list during the current quarter 
north america average cost per subscribers acquisition of a new removed from period subscriber new subscribers list balance q q q q q q q q q q q q 
table of contents europe average cost per subscribers acquisition of a new removed from period subscriber new subscribers list balance q q q q q q q q q q q q in north america  we have noted a general trend of decreasing average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber cpa in compared to and a decrease in cpa in the second  third and fourth quarters of from the first quarter of the recent quarterly decreases in cpa reflect the effects of new advertising campaigns and decreases in advertising rates by our media suppliers 
we do not consider the decrease in cpa to be indicative of a longer term trend or to indicate that our cpa is likely to stay at this level or is likely to decrease further 
in europe  we see a large fluctuation in the cpa 
the average cost fluctuates from quarter to quarter and from country to country 
the decline in cpa in europe in q reflects the change in the exchange rates between q and q and accounted for of the decrease in the cpa 
in q  a higher proportion of the total subscribers we acquired were in germany  where historically  the acquisition costs have been higher compared to the other countries in europe 
this was the primary reason for the increase in the cpa in q compared to q the decrease in cpa in q from q is in part due to an improved method of subscriber acquisition 
we do not consider the q decrease in cpa to be indicative of a longer term trend or to indicate that our cpa is likely to stay at this level or is likely to decrease further 
future increases in cpa are likely to result in higher absolute marketing expenses and potentially higher relative marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
going forward  we expect continued upward pressure on online advertising rates and continued activity from competitors  which will likely increase our cpa over the long term 
the effect on operations is that greater absolute and relative marketing expenditure may be necessary to continue to grow the reach of our publications 
however  it is possible that the factors driving subscriber acquisition cost increases can be partially or completely offset by new or improved methods of subscriber acquisition using techniques which are under evaluation

the net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was from the cash received from the sale of our asia pacific business segment and the cash received from the exercise of stock options 
our capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products and services  the amount of our resources we devote to development of new products  cash payments to former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  expansion of our operations  and the amount of our resources we devote to promoting awareness of the travelzoo brand 
since the inception of the program under which we would make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period  we have incurred expenses of million 
while future payments for this program are expected to decrease  the total cost of this program is still undeterminable because it is dependent on our stock price and on the number of valid requests ultimately received 
consistent with our growth  we have experienced a substantial increase in our sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  and we anticipate that these increases will continue for the foreseeable future 
we believe cash on hand will be sufficient to pay such costs 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  the consummation of any of which would increase our capital requirements 
although we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  unanticipated events or a less favorable than expected development of our business in europe may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish credit facilities to raise capital in order to meet our capital requirements 
if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  the sale could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
if we issue debt securities or establish a credit facility  our fixed obligations could increase  and we may be required to agree to operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot be sure that any such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if the development of our business in europe is less favorable than expected  we may decide to significantly reduce the size of our operations and marketing expenses in these markets with the objective of reducing cash outflow

com in february we launched local deals in the third quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after november  the new accounting standard requires a company to perform qualitative analysis when determining whether it must consolidate a variable interest entity and ongoing reassessments to determine if a company must consolidate a variable interest entity 
the new accounting standard also requires a company to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities  any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement and how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the company s financial statements 
a company will also be required to disclose any significant judgments and assumptions made in determining whether it must consolidate a variable interest entity 
effective january   we adopted this new accounting standard 
the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued asu  a new accounting standard update for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
the new accounting standard update defines when individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the update primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the update also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
effective january   we adopted this new accounting standard 
we do not expect that the adoption of this new accounting standard will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our potential exposure to changes in market interest rates is not material 
the company has no outstanding debt and is not a party to any derivatives transactions 
we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments 
our operations in canada expose us to foreign currency risk associated with agreements being denominated in canadian dollars 
our operations in europe expose us to foreign currency risk associated with agreements being denominated in british pound sterling and euros 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations of these currencies as the financial position and operating results of our operations in canada and europe will be translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 
we are a net receiver of us dollars from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies used by the foreign subsidiaries as their functional currency 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of applicable foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in such foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in an incremental  foreign exchange loss for the twelve month period ended december
