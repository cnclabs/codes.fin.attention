item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview 
we are a company that operates in one segment  heavy civil construction  through its subsidiaries  which specialize in the building  reconstruction and repair of transportation and water infrastructure primarily in large markets with long term growth trends in texas  utah and nevada 
transportation infrastructure projects include highways  roads  bridges and light and commuter rail 
water infrastructure projects include water  wastewater and storm drainage systems 
sterling provides general contracting services primarily to public sector clients  including excavating  concrete and asphalt paving  installation of large diameter water and wastewater distribution systems  construction of bridges and similar large structures  construction of light and commuter rail infrastructure  concrete and asphalt batch plant operations  concrete crus hing and aggregate operations 
we perform the majority of the work required by our contracts with our own crews and equipment 
our business was founded in and has a history of profitable growth  which we have achieved by expanding both our service profile and our market areas 
this involves adding services  such as concrete operations  in order to capture a greater percentage of available work in current and potential markets 
it also involves strategically expanding operations  either by establishing an office in a new market  often after having successfully bid on and completed a project in that market  or by acquiring a company that gives us an immediate entry into a market 
on december   we acquired an interest in ralph l 
wadsworth construction company  llc rlw and on october   we acquired a interest in road and highway builders  llc rhb  which have primarily performed construction projects in utah and nevada  respectively 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in this document  and conform to the fasb s accounting standards codification or gaap or asc 
we operate in one segment and have only one reportable segment and one reporting unit component  heavy civil construction 
in making this determination  we considered that each project has similar characteristics  includes similar services and similar types of customers and is subject to similar regulatory and economic environments 
we organize  evaluate  and manage our financial information around each project when making operating decisions and assessing overall performance 
even if our local offices were to be considered separate components of our heavy civil construction operating segment  those components could be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment under asc and eitf d because our local offices all have similar economic characteristics and are similar in all of the following areas the nature of the products and services each of our local offices perform similar construction projects they build  reconstruct and repair roads  highways  bridges  light and commuter rail and water  waste water and storm drainage systems 
the nature of the production processes our heavy civil construction services rendered in the construction production process for each of our construction projects performed by each local office is the same they excavate dirt  remove existing pavement and pipe  lay aggregate or concrete pavement  pipe and rail and build bridges and similar large structures in order to complete our projects 
the type or class of customer for products and services substantially all of our customers are federal and state departments of transportation  cities  counties  and regional water  rail and toll road authorities 
a substantial portion of the funding for the state departments of transportation to finance the projects we construct is furnished by the federal government 
the methods used to distribute products or provide services the heavy civil construction services rendered on our projects are performed primarily with our own field work crews laborers  equipment operators and supervisors and equipment backhoes  loaders  dozers  graders  cranes  pug mills  crushers  and concrete and asphalt plants 
the nature of the regulatory environment we perform substantially all of our projects for federal  state and municipal governmental agencies  and all of the projects that we perform are subject to substantially similar regulation under us and state department of transportation rules  including prevailing wage and hour laws  codes established by the federal government and municipalities regarding water and waste water systems installation  and laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health of the us occupational safety and health administration and to the employment of immigrants of the us department of homeland security 
the economic characteristics of our local offices are similar 
while profit margin objectives included in contract bids have some variability from contract to contract  our profit margin objectives are not differentiated by our chief operating decision maker or our office management based on local office location 
instead  the projects undertaken by each local office are primarily competitively bid  fixed unit or negotiated lump sum price contracts  all of which are bid based on achieving gross margin objectives that reflect the relevant skills required  the contract size and duration  the availability of our personnel and equipment  the makeup and level of our existing backlog  our competitive advantages and disadvantages  prior experience  the contracting agency or customer  the source of contract funding  anticipated start and comp letion dates  construction risks  penalties or incentives and general economic conditions 

table of contents use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  different project scopes and specifications  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimati ng of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits for each project in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost for each project during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can adversely change the estimate of total contract revenue  cost and profit include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the failure of subcontractors to perform as agreed  unusual weather conditions  our failure to achieve expected producti vity and efficient use of labor and equipment and the inaccuracies of our original bid estimate 
because we have a large number of projects in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates  particularly on larger  more complex projects  can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
after we are advised that our bid is the winning bid  we enter into firm contracts with most of our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting those contract costs 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to compl ete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as a result  we have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
assuming performance by our suppliers and subcontractors  the principal remaining risks under our fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity levels 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the percentage of completion method of accounting in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor  materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts 
our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of projects of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor and supplier performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
at december   we had goodwill with a carrying amount of approximately million which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we completed our annual impairment review for historical goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and it indicated that there was no impairment in goodwill 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  where necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
we are subject to the alternative minimum tax  or amt  and payments of amt result in a reduction of our net deferred tax liability 
our deferred tax assets related to prior year nols for financial statement purposes were fully utilized during in addition to the utilization of those nols  we had available to us the excess tax benefit resulting from exercise of a significant number of non qualified in the money options  which we utilized in the preparation of our and federal income tax returns 
accordingly  because we will no longer have offsets provided by the nols  a comparison of our future cash flows to our historic cash flows may not be meaningful 
results of operations 
backlog at december  at december   our backlog of construction projects was million  as compared to million at december  our company was awarded or was the apparent low bidder on million of new contracts in  compared to million of new contracts in our contracts are typically completed in to months 
at december   there was approximately million of our consolidated backlog where we were the apparent low bidder  but had not yet been formally awarded the contract or the contract price had not been finalized 
included in the latter amount is million related to a contract on which we were the low bidder where the customer has deferred award until april due to funding issues 
in february  a joint venture in which the company has a interest was selected as the best value proposer to design and build a section of highway northeast of austin  texas  for a price of million 
the company s share of this contract of approximately million is not included in the amount of backlog outstanding at december  historically  subsequent non awards of low bids or finalization of contract prices have not materially affected our backlog or financial condition 
backlog includes our share of million of estimated revenues related to joint ventures including million where we are a noncontrolling venturer 
during the last quarter of and throughout the years and  the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitive because of the following while our business includes only minimal residential and commercial infrastructure work  the severe fall off in new projects in those markets has resulted in some residential and commercial infrastructure contractors bidding on some public sector transportation and water infrastructure projects  sometimes at bid levels below our break even pricing  thus increasing competition and creating downward pressure on bid prices in our markets 
traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins  sometimes at bid levels below our break even pricing  in order to replenish their reduced backlogs 
the entrance of new competitors from other states 
these factors have limited our ability to increase our backlog through successful bids for new projects and have compressed the profitability on the new projects where we submitted successful bids 
while we have been more aggressive in reducing the anticipated margins we use to bid on some projects  we have not bid at anticipated loss margins in order to obtain new backlog 
recent reductions in miles driven in the us and more fuel efficient vehicles have reduced federal and state gasoline taxes and tolls collected 
in addition  the federal government has not renewed the safetea lu bill  which provided states with substantial funding for transportation infrastructure projects 
since the safetea lu bill expired on september   the federal government has been extending financial assistance to the states on an interim basis  most recently through september  continued deferral of new funding legislation or reductions in federal funding may negatively impact the states highway and bridge construction expenditures for their fiscal years and most states fiscal years end in the summer 
we had anticipated these matters would be resolved by now  howev er  they have not yet been resolved and we are unable to predict when or on what terms the federal government might renew the safetea lu bill or enact other similar legislation 
further  the nationwide decline in home sales  the increase in foreclosures and a prolonged recession have resulted in decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes  which are among the sources of funding for municipal road  bridge and water infrastructure construction 
expenditures by municipalities may also be limited due to federal  state and local funding limitations in the current economic environment 
these and other factors have adversely affected the levels of transportation and water infrastructure capital expenditures in our markets  reducing bidding opportunities to replace backlog and increasing competition for new projects 
assuming that these factors continue to affect infrastructure capital expenditures in our markets in the near term  and taking into account the amount of backlog we had at december  and the lower anticipated margin bid on some projects the company has recently been awarded and has started work on or expects to start work on in  we currently anticipate that the company s net income and diluted earnings per common share of stock attributable to sterling common stockholders for will be below the results we achieved for we do  however  expect that our markets will ultimately recover from the conditions described above and that our backlog and revenues will grow and gross margins  net income and earnings per share will return to levels more consistent with historical rates of return 
however  we cannot predict the timing of such a return to historical normalcy in our markets 
we believe that the company is in a sound financial condition and has the resources and management experience to weather current market conditions and to continue to compete successfully for projects as they become available at acceptable profit margin levels

revenues increased or million in fiscal year over fiscal year  with most of that increase arising in the fourth quarter of the increase was due to the inclusion of our utah operations in the consolidated results of operations for all of  compared to one month in these operations were acquired on december  
partially offsetting this increase for the fiscal year were decreases in revenues of our texas and nevada operations due to the market conditions that have continued since including increased competition and the consequent lower bid prices  lack of visibility on federal highway funding to states  and lower state gasoline and local sales and property taxes  which support infrastructure spending by state  counties and municipalities as more fully explained above under backlog at december  gross profit 
during  we had as many as contracts in progress 
the nearer a contract progresses toward completion  the more visibility we have in refining our estimate of total revenues including incentives  delay penalties and change orders  costs and gross profit 
thus gross profit as a percent of revenues can increase or decrease from comparable and sequential years and quarters due to variations among contracts and depending upon which contracts are just commencing or are at a more advanced stage of completion 
the increase in gross profit of million for the year over the year was due primarily to the inclusion of the gross profit on revenues of our utah operations and differences in the mix in the stage of completion and gross margins of contracts in progress at december  compared to december   including finalization of change orders and revision of total estimated gross profit due to better visibility of revenues and costs on certain projects 
the increase in gross profit of our utah operations was partially offset by lower gross profits of our texas and nevada operations as a result of lower revenues and approximately million of under absorption of depreciation and other costs related to lower equipment utilization  both due to lower activity in those states 
management believes such equipment will be used when those markets return to a normalized level of activity and consequently believes there is no impairment in the value of such equipment 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of of million was million greater than the comparable period because of the inclusion of our utah operations in the consolidation for all three months in fourth quarter of compared with only one month in the fourth quarter of  better weather in texas in the fourth quarter of than  and differences  as discussed above  in the mix in the stage of completion and gross margins of contracts in progress at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for quarterly results of operations 

table of contents operating income 
operating income decreased million or from to for the following reasons 
offsetting the million increase in gross profit was an increase in general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses g a of million in over the primary reasons for the increase were g a incurred by our utah operations consolidated for a full year in as compared to one month in  professional fees associated with the appeal of a lawsuit and strategic and management planning activities  higher information technology expenses  and a write off of certain specialized equipment with a net book value of million that we no longer believe will be used on future project awards 
also  during the fourth quarter of  t he company incurred million in direct cost of the acquisition of rlw which under gaap  had to be charged to expense rather than capitalized as part of the acquisition cost 
in addition  in january   a jury awarded million to a subcontractor plaintiff against the company which had been recorded as an expense at december  the company has appealed the verdict see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a percent of revenues  g a increased to in versus in due to the reasons discussed above 
income taxes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate to in versus in was due to higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners which is taxed to those owners rather than sterling and non taxable interest income 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures increased because of increased earnings of those entities in versus  primarily as a result of the acquisition of our utah operations in december fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  change dollar amounts in thousands revenues gross profit gross margin general and administrative expenses unusual items nm other income expense operating income operating margin gain loss on the sale of short term investments nm interest income interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income noncontrolling owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures net income attributable to sterling common stockholders contract backlog  end of year nm not meaningful 
table of contents revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  from to the decrease was due to the company winning fewer contracts as a result of an increase in the number of competitors bidding at lower prices in our texas and nevada markets for new work bid during and more days of rain in texas during the fourth quarter of than the comparable period 
further  some of our competitors in those markets appear to have bid at margins which were less than our break even pricing apparently in order to replenish their backlogs 
this trend has continued into the increase in competitors and consequent lower bid prices are due to the market conditions discussed above under backlog at december  offsetting the decrease in revenues in our texas and nevada markets were december revenues of million of our utah operations which were acquired effective december  during the last half of  we began to reduce the number of our crews as a result of completing certain projects without replacement contracts in backlog 
at december   our employees  excluding people in our utah operations  totaled versus approximately  employees at december  contracts receivables increased million at december  versus december   as a result of the acquisition of the utah operations offset by the effect of the decrease in revenues in texas 
an increase occurred in accounts payable for the same reasons  but to a lesser extent 
revenues in the fourth quarter of were million less than those in the comparable quarter of because of increased competition and adverse weather in texas and were the lowest revenues we have had in texas since the first quarter of the decrease in fourth quarter revenues was after including revenues for the month of december of our utah operations in consolidated revenues 
gross profit 
during and  our texas and nevada operations had as many as contracts in progress at any one time  of various sizes  of different expected profitability and in various stages of completion 
the nearer a contract progresses toward completion  the more visibility we have in refining our estimate of total revenues including incentives  delay penalties and change orders  costs and gross profit 
thus gross profit as a percent of revenues can increase or decrease from comparable and sequential years and quarters due to variations among contracts and depending upon which contracts are just commencing or are at a more advanced stage of completion 
at december   our contracts were on average at a more advanced stage of completion than were those in pr ogress at the comparable period end 
the increase in gross profit of million for the year over the year was due primarily to better execution on contracts in progress  differences  as discussed above  in the mix in the stage of completion and profitability of contracts in progress at december  compared to december  and one month of gross profit of million on the revenues earned by our newly acquired utah operations 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of of million was million less than the comparable period because of the lower quarterly revenues and adverse weather in texas offset by our utah operation gross profit 
see note to the company consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly financial information 
operating income 
operating income increased million or in over as a result of the million increase in gross profit which was partially offset by an increase of million in general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses g a in as compared to the primary reasons for the increase were the g a incurred by our utah operations for the month of december  million in direct cost of the acquisition of rlw which under gaap  effective january   had to be charged to expense rather than capitalized as part of the acquisition cost  and in january   a jury awarded million to a subcontractor plaintiff against the company which was recorded as an expense at december  the company has appealed the verdict see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a percent of revenues  g a was in versus in the higher level of g a as a percent of revenues in vs 
was due to the impact of the decrease in revenues in as g a does not vary directly with the volume of work performed on contracts  the acquisition cost and the provision for loss on the lawsuit 

table of contents income taxes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate of in versus in was due to higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners which are taxed to those owners rather than sterling and higher domestic production activities deduction in than net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners increased because of increased earnings in in nevada versus and the acquisition of our utah operations in december historical cash flows 
the following table sets forth information about our cash flows for the years ended december   through year ended december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents at end of period net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities supplementary information capital expenditures working capital at end of period operating activities 
significant non cash items included in operating activities are depreciation and amortization which for totaled million increased million from which had increased million from as a result of capital expenditures of million in and million in and a full year depreciation in on equipment purchased in the rlw acquisition in december  deferred tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation methods used on equipment for tax purposes and amortization for tax return purposes of goodwill arising in the acquisition of rhb and rlw 
besides net income of million in and the non cash items discussed above  other significant components of cash flows from operations were contracts receivable decreased by million in the current year and million in versus an increase of million in due to the reductions in revenues in texas and nevada during and versus  the increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million for  versus a decrease of million for  was due to an increase in the volume of materials purchased for certain projects at december   but not billed to the customer until and the timing of other billings  the increase in receivables from and the equity in construction joint ventures of million for to million at december  versus a balance of million at december  this increase resulted from increased activity in by joint ventures of our utah operations 
accounts payable increased by million in as compared to a decrease of million in the decrease in was due to lower project activity during the fourth quarter of  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by million in as compared to a decrease of million in due to a reduction in advance billings 

table of contents investing activities 
expenditures for the replacement of certain equipment and to expand our construction fleet totaled million in as compared to million in  and million in respectively 
capital equipment is acquired as needed to support work crews required by increased backlog and to replace retiring equipment 
the increase in was primarily due to purchases of additional equipment to perform our responsibilities on a large joint venture project in utah 
the decreases in capital expenditures in and were principally due to management cautious view regarding certain of the company markets in and  due to economic uncertainties 
management expects capital expenditures in to be higher than as a result of normal replacement of equipment  which repl acement was deferred in and  additional equipment required by the utah joint venture project and a recent low bid on a large job in texas  and shop and office facilities to be acquired by two of our offices in texas 
during the twelve months ended december   and  the company had net sales of short term securities of million and net purchases of million in and million in the purchases were primarily due to cash generated by operations  after repayment of indebtedness  and invested in such securities 
the reduction of short term securities in was due to repayment of debt 
in december  we purchased an equity interest in rlw for a net cash purchase price of million  net of cash acquired  in order to expand our construction operations to utah 
financing activities 
financing activities in  and primarily reflect a reduction of million  million and million  respectively  in borrowings under our million credit facility 
the amount of borrowings under the credit facility is based on the company expectations of working capital requirements 
additionally  the company sold million shares of common stock in for net proceeds of million 
liquidity 
the level of working capital for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in customer receivables and contract retentions  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  investments in our unconsolidated construction joint ventures  the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings  and the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 

table of contents some of these fluctuations can be significant 
as of december   we had working capital of million  a decrease of million over december  the decrease in working capital was the result of the following in thousands net income depreciation and amortization deferred tax expense capital expenditures debt repayment  net of drawdowns dividends paid to noncontrolling interests owners other total decrease in working capital the company believes that it has sufficient liquid financial resources  including availability under its credit facility of million at december   to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations  including its bonding requirements  and the company expects no material adverse change in its liquidity 
future developments or events  such as an increase in our level of purchases of equipment to support significantly higher backlog or an acquisition of another company could  however  affect our level of working capital 
sources of capital 
in addition to our available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments balances and cash provided by operations  we use borrowings under our credit facility with comerica bank to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we have a million credit facility with a bank syndicate for which comerica bank is a participant and agent 
the credit facility entered into on october   has a maturity date of october   and is secured by all assets of the company  other than proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts which are pledged to our bond surety 
borrowings under the credit facility are used to finance working capital 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  however  there was a letter of credit of million outstanding under the credit facility  which reduces availability under the credit facility 
availability under the credit facility was  therefore  million without violating any of the financial covenants discussed in the next paragraph 
average month end borrowings under the credit facility for the fiscal year were million and the largest amount of end of month borrowings under the credit facility was million on march  the credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants at quarter end relating to fixed charges  leverage  tangible net worth  asset coverage and consolidated net losses 
the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make distributions or pay dividends  incur liens and encumbrances  incur further indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party  incur negative income for two consecutive quarters 
make investments in securities 

table of contents to date the company has not experienced any difficulty in borrowing under our credit agreement or any material change in its terms  and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  the financial markets have experienced substantial volatility as a result of disruptions in the credit markets and the recession 
however  to date we have not experienced any difficulty in borrowing under our credit facility or any change in its terms 
management believes that the credit facility will provide adequate funding for the company s working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including seasonal fluctuations at least through december  the unpaid principal balance of each prime based loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to comerica s prime rate plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable prime margins will be  or  respectively 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under this revolver during the year ended december  was at all times that the company had debt outstanding under this facility 
at our election  the loans under the new credit facility bear interest at either a libor based interest rate or a prime based interest rate 
the prime based interest rate option plus the applicable prime based margin can be no less than the daily adjusting libor plus  or federal funds rate plus 
the unpaid principal balance of each libor based loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
the pricing leverage ratio is determined by the ratio of our average total debt  less cash and cash equivalents  to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda that we achieve on a rolling four quarter basis 
the pricing leverage ratio is measured quarterly 
if we ach ieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable libor margins will be  or  respectively  and the applicable prime based margins will be  and  respectively 
interest on libor based loans is payable at the end of the relevant libor interest period  which must be one  two  three or six months 
mortgage 
in we completed the construction of a new headquarters building on land owned by us adjacent to our equipment repair facility in houston 
the building was financed principally through an additional mortgage of million on the land and facilities at a floating interest rate which at december  was per annum  repayable over years 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our fixed  non cancelable obligations at december  payments due by period total year years years years amounts in thousands credit facility operating leases mortgage our obligations for interest are not included in the table above as these amounts vary according to the levels of debt outstanding at any time 
interest on our credit facility is paid monthly and fluctuates with the balances outstanding during the year  as well as with fluctuations in interest rates 
in interest on the credit facility was approximately  the mortgages are expected to have future annual interest expense payments of approximately  in less than one year   in one to three years  and  in four to five years 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  the noncontrolling interest owners of two of our subsidiaries have the right to require the company to buy their interest in those subsidiaries in and at december   the estimated put liability and undistributed earnings attributable to those noncontrolling interest owners was approximately million 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts  we generally obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as is customary in the construction business  we are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and reputation and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
we have pledged all proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety company 
events that affect the insurance and bonding markets may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future  or being available only at a significantly greater cos t 
to date  we have not encountered difficulties or material cost increases in obtaining new surety bonds 

table of contents capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during were million  and during were million 
the increase in from the level was due in part to purchases of additional equipment to perform our contracts  including a large joint venture in utah 
in  we expect our capital additions to be higher than due to normal replacement of equipment which replacement was deferred in and  additional equipment that will be required by the utah operations to perform its responsibilities on the joint venture project and a recent low bid on a large job in texas  and shop and office facilities to be acquired by two of our offices in texas 
inflation 
until  inflation had not had a material impact on our financial results  however  that year increases in oil and fuel prices affected our cost of operations 
while the prices we have paid for oil and fuel and  generally  for other materials have decreased  we have over the last several months seen the prices of oil and fuel rise once again and seen increases in steel prices 
anticipated cost increases and reductions are considered in our bids to customers on proposed new construction projects 
where we are the successful bidder on a project  we execute purchase orders with material suppliers and contracts with subcontractors covering the prices of most materials and services  other than oil and fuel products  thereby mitigating future price increases and supply disruptions 
these purchase orders and contracts do not contain quantity guarantees and we have no obligation for materials and services beyond those required to complete the contracts with our customers 
there can be no assurance that oil and fuel used in our business will be adequately covered by the estimated escalation we have included in our bids or that all of our vendors will fulfill their pricing and supply commitments under their purchase orders and contracts with the company 
we adjust our total estimated costs on our projec ts when we believe it is probable that we will have cost increases which will not be recovered from customers  vendors or re engineering 
off balance sheet arrangements and joint ventures 
we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
the venture contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for construction joint ventures provide that each party will assume and fund its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share  we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to p rovide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december   there was approximately million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts of which million represented our proportionate share 
due to the joint and several liability under our joint venture arrangements  if one of our joint venture partners fails to perform  we and the remaining joint venture partners  would be responsible for completion of the outstanding work 
as of december   we are not aware of situations that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts 
the only other off balance sheet arrangements are related to the operating leases included in the table in contractual obligations above 
new accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued fair value measurements and disclosure topic regarding the disclosure requirements of existing us gaap related to fair value measurements 
this standard requires additional disclosures about recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
these disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements for which disclosure becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
this standard did not impact our financial position  results o f operations and cash flows for the fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates are one of our sources of market risk 
outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
based on the average debt under our credit facility and mortgage outstanding during  we estimate that an increase of in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  in to manage risks of changes in material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids for construction contracts  we obtain firm price quotations from our suppliers  except for fuel  and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
during  we commenced a strategy of investing in certain securities  the assets of which are a crude oil commodity pool 
we believed that the gains and losses on these securities would tend to offset increases and decreases in the price we paid for diesel and gasoline fuel and reduce the volatility of such fuel costs in our operations 
for the year ended december   the company had a pre tax realized loss of  on these securities and an unrealized pre tax loss of  subsequent to december   we sold our position in these securities resulting in a realized pre tax loss of we are reviewing the use of financial futures contracts to further manage price risks of fuel 
at this time  we have no such financial contracts in place
