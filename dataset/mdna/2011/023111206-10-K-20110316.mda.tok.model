item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning future events and performance of the company 
when used in this report  the words intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  plan or expect and similar expressions are included to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements 
you should review carefully the factors identified in this report in item a  risk factors 
we disclaim any intent to update or announce revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect actual events or developments  except as required by law 
except as otherwise indicated herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to our fiscal year ended december overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing improved treatments for cardiovascular disease 
we are currently focusing our efforts on amr  a prescription grade omega fatty acid  comprising not less than ultra pure icosapent ethyl ethyl epa 
on october   we completed a private placement resulting in gross proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to fund the marine and anchor studies for amr in connection with this private placement  a significant portion of our board of directors and executive management were changed  and our research and development activities  as well as certain executive functions  were consolidated from multiple offices to our research and development headquarters in the united states 
in connection with these changes  we re focused our efforts on developing improved treatments for cardiovascular disease and ceased development of all product candidates outside of our cardiovascular disease focus 
in november  we reported positive top line results from the marine trial  the first of our two planned phase clinical trials of amr in the marine trial  amr was investigated as a treatment for very high triglycerides mg dl 
amr is presently being investigated in a second phase clinical trial  the anchor trial  for the treatment of patients with high triglycerides and mg dl who are also receiving statin therapy 
the marine trial was a multi center  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind  week pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of grams and grams of amr in patients with fasting triglyceride levels mg dl 
patients with this level of triglycerides are characterized as having very high triglyceride levels  as outlined in the ncep guidelines 
the primary endpoint in the trial was the percentage change in triglyceride level from baseline compared to placebo after weeks of treatment 
reported top line results of this study included announcement that amr met the primary endpoint at both the gram and gram doses 
in addition to achieving the primary endpoint of the trial  no statistically significant increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol  or ldl c  was observed in this trial at either dose 
additionally  we observed in the trial a safety profile for amr similar to placebo 
the anchor trial is a multi center  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind  week pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of grams and grams of amr in patients with high triglycerides and mg dl who are on statin therapy 
patients in this trial are characterized as having high triglyceride levels  as outlined in the ncep guidelines  with mixed dyslipidemia two or more lipid disorders 
the primary endpoint in the trial is the percentage change in triglyceride level from baseline compared to placebo after weeks of treatment 
no prescription omega based drug  such as amr  is currently approved in the us for treating high triglyceride levels in statin treated patients who have mixed dyslipidemia 
in december  we announced that we completed patient enrollment and randomization with patients enrolled and randomized to the gram  gram and placebo arms of the trial 
we expect to announce top line results from the anchor trial in the second quarter of 
table of contents the marine trial was conducted under a spa with the fda 
the anchor trial is currently being conducted under a separate spa 
an spa is an evaluation by the fda of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the phase iii trial protocol design  clinical endpoints  and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval 
the fda agreed that  based on the information we submitted to the agency  the design and planned analysis of the marine and anchor trials adequately address the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 
an spa is generally binding upon the fda unless a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy is identified after the testing begins 
although we are not aware of any such issue  there is no assurance that the fda will ultimately consider either of our spas to be binding 
moreover  any change to a study protocol can invalidate an spa 
if fda does not consider either of the spas to be binding  the agency could assert that additional studies or data are required to support a regulatory submission 
we expect to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda in the third quarter of requesting approval to market and sell amr in the united states 
our strategy is to seek fda approval for amr based on the results of the marine and anchor trials while considering additional trials to further expand the indication of use potential for amr we are currently preparing our nda for amr based on the marine trial results 
depending on the timing of the nda and the results of the anchor trial  we may elect to add the anchor trial results to the nda we are preparing 
if the anchor results are added to the nda  the nda will seek approval for the indication studied in the marine trial with the anchor results either as a separate indication for use or referenced in the label as data supporting the safe use of amr in the treatment of high triglyceride levels in statin treated patients who have mixed dyslipidemia 
in order to obtain a separate indication for amr based on the anchor trial results  the fda requires that we have a clinical outcomes study substantially underway at the time of the nda filing 
the results of an outcomes study are not required for fda approval of the broader indication and an outcomes study is not required for the indication being studied in the marine trial 
opportunities to market and sell amr outside the united states are currently under evaluation 
in january we completed an equity offering from which we received approximately million in net proceeds 
together with our cash balance of million at december   we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to enable us to file the nda and prepare for the commercialization of amr  regardless of the nda submission strategy we choose 
clinical trial status the marine trial patient enrollment in this trial began in december  enrollment and randomization was completed in august at patients 
on november   we reported top line data for the marine trial  where amr was shown to effectively lower triglyceride levels in patients with very high triglycerides mg dl without significantly increasing ldl c 
the marine trial results also included favorable findings with respect to significant reductions in total cholesterol  non hdl c  apo b apolipoprotein b  and lp pla levels  together with a safety profile for amr comparable to placebo 
the marine trial was conducted in a population representative of millions of people with very high triglyceride levels  which is estimated to include approximately million people in the united states 
the study s primary endpoint  the percent change in triglyceride  or tg  levels from baseline to week compared to placebo  was met for both the gram and gram dose groups 
the marine study was required to meet a stringent level of statistical significance of p  as agreed in our spa with the fda 
twenty five percent of patients in this trial were on background statin therapy 
the patient group treated with grams of amr showed a significant median tg decrease of p compared to placebo  and the patient group treated with grams of amr showed a significant median tg decrease of p compared to placebo 
the median baseline triglyceride levels were mg dl  mg dl and mg dl for the patient groups treated with placebo  grams of amr and grams of amr  respectively 

table of contents in a pre specified secondary analysis in the subgroup of patients with baseline tg mg dl  representing of all patients  the effect of amr in reducing tg levels from placebo was for grams and for grams  both statistically significant p for grams and p for grams  respectively 
the median baseline tg levels in this subgroup were mg dl  mg dl and mg dl for placebo  gram and gram groups  respectively 
in addition  the subgroup of patients on background statin therapy had much greater median reductions in tg  which were also statistically significant  than those not on statin therapy 
amr did not result in an increase in median ldl c compared to placebo at either dose for the gram group and for the gram group p ns this is the first and only triglyceride lowering therapy studied in this population with very high triglyceride levels to show a lack of elevation in ldl c 
in addition  there was a statistically significant decrease in median non hdl c total cholesterol less good cholesterol compared to placebo with both of the amr treated groups for the gram group 
p 
and for the gram group 
p marine trial results also included statistically significant reductions in several important lipid markers  including apo b  lp pla lipoprotein phospholipase a  vldl c and total cholesterol 
for these achieved endpoints  p values were for most and for all 
apo b apolipoprotein b is a sensitive index of residual cardiovascular risk and is generally considered to be a better predictor than ldl c 
lp pla is an enzyme found in blood and atherosclerotic plaque  high levels have been implicated in the development and progression of atherosclerosis 
amr was well tolerated in the marine trial with a safety profile comparable to placebo 
there were no treatment related serious adverse events in the marine study 
we plan to provide more details of these results at scientific meetings in patients enrolled in the marine trial were given the option to continue on with amr treatment for a period of up to weeks after their last dose in the pivotal trial 
the results from this week open label extension period are not part of the marine trial clinical endpoints 
the marine trial was conducted under a spa with the fda 
an spa is an evaluation by the fda of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the phase iii trial protocol design  clinical endpoints  and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval 
the fda agreed that  based on the information we submitted to the agency  the design and planned analysis of the marine trial adequately address the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 
an spa is generally binding upon the fda unless a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy is identified after the testing begins 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
if fda does not consider the spa to be binding  the agency could assert that additional studies or data are required to support a regulatory submission 
the anchor trial the anchor trial is a multi center  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind  week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of grams and grams of amr in patients with high triglyceride levels of mg dl and mg dl who are on stable statin therapy 
patients in this trial are classified as having high triglyceride levels with mixed dyslipidemia 
the primary endpoint in the trial is the percent change in triglyceride level from baseline to week compared to placebo 
an important secondary endpoint in the anchor trial  necessary in order for us to achieve the broad indication sought from this trial  is to show that the addition of amr to statin therapy does not increase ldl cholesterol ldl c or bad cholesterol compared to placebo in this population 
patient enrollment in this trial began in early on december   we announced that we completed patient enrollment and randomization with patients enrolled and randomized to the gram  gram and placebo arms of the trial 
we expect that the patients randomized will be sufficient to demonstrate statistical significance in accordance with the trial protocol 
prior to randomization into the week treatment period  all 
table of contents patients underwent a six to eight week washout period of lipid altering drugs  as well as diet and lifestyle stabilization 
we expect to announce top line results from the anchor trial in the second quarter of if the results from the anchor trial are positive  we intend to use these results as the basis for broadening the label for amr beyond treatment for very high triglycerides to include treatment for elevated triglycerides in patients with mixed dyslipidemia on background statin therapy 
this should enable the treatment of the majority of patients clinically indicated for hypertriglyceridemic therapy  as outlined by the ncep guidelines 
in order to seek approval of this potentially expanded indication  we will be required to have substantially enrolled subjects in a medical outcomes study at the time of our nda submission 
we are in the process of defining the clinical trial design for the outcome study 
we do not anticipate initiating the outcome study until after the anchor trial is complete 
the results of this outcomes study are not required for approval of the indication studied in the anchor trial  the only requirement is that the outcome study is substantially underway 
the anchor trial is being conducted under an spa with the fda and all of the clinical sites in the trial are located in the united states 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to derivative financial liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial liabilities derivative financial liabilities on initial recognition are recorded at fair value 
they are subsequently held at fair value  with gains and losses arising for changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of derivative financial liabilities is determined using valuation techniques  typically we use the black scholes option pricing model  or a monte carlo simulation depending on the nature of the instrument 
we use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date 
fluctuations in the assumptions used in the valuation model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if we issue shares to discharge the liability  the derivative financial liability is derecognized and common stock and additional paid in capital are recognized on the issuance of those shares 
for options and warrants treated as derivative financial liabilities  at settlement date the carrying value of the options and warrants are transferred to equity 
the cash proceeds received from shareholders for additional shares are recorded in common stock and additional paid in capital 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 

table of contents effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  versus december  revenue 
we recorded no revenue in or research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below research and development expenses non cash stock based compensation expense non cash change in fair value of ester share based liability research and development expense  excluding non cash charges  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased costs in for our amr cardiovascular program  primarily costs associated with our two phase iii clinical trials incurred through medpace  the cro we engaged in late to help us set up and manage the two trials 
we began enrolling patients in these trials in early and announced the completion of enrollment in both trials during the second half of these clinical trial cost increases were partially offset by lower costs for non cardiovascular development programs which were discontinued during the fourth quarter of stock based compensation expense included within research and development was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash change in fair value of ester share based liability for the year ended december  reflects the change in the fair value from december  to the may settlement date of the liability associated with milestone ia of the ester share purchase agreement see further discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect research and development expenses associated with the marine and anchor studies to decrease during as those trials near completion 
however  if we elect to conduct an outcomes study  which decision will follow upon review of the anchor results and finalization of an outcome study design  the anticipated decline in research and development could be substantially offset by costs associated with the outcomes study 

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below general and administrative expenses non cash warrant related compensation expense non cash stock based compensation expense restructuring  severance and lease exit costs general and administrative expense  excluding restructuring  severance and non cash compensation charges for stock compensation and warrants  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to lower staffing and overhead expenses in  due to a reduction in office locations in as a result of a restructuring in late in conjunction with the october private placement  which also included the termination of non cardiovascular development programs 
warrant related compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million 
warrant related compensation expense for the period ended december  reflects a non cash expense for the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability associated with warrants issued in october to three former employees of amarin  net of warrants exercised 
the increase in the fair value of the warrants is due primarily to an increase in our stock price between december  and december  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million due primarily to an increase in option awards for the year ended december  to attract and retain qualified employees 
restructuring  severance and lease exit costs were million for the year ended december  versus million in the prior year 
restructuring  severance and lease exit costs includes primarily costs for severance  office consolidation and the relocation of certain operations to mystic  ct 
we expect general and administrative costs in to begin to increase as we prepare for the commercialization of amr  including costs for market research  sales force preparation and inventory management 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  was expense of million versus income of million in the prior year period 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability is primarily related to the change in fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with the october private placement 
in october we issued million warrants at an exercise price of and recorded a million warrant derivative liability  representing the fair value of the warrants issued 
as these warrants have been classified as a derivative liability  they are revalued at each reporting period  with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  for these warrants 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  the increase in the warrant derivative liability value was due primarily to the increase in the price of the company s common stock 
see further discussion of the warrant derivative liability in note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense  net 
interest income includes interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  versus million in the prior year 
the decrease was due 
table of contents primarily to the amortization of the difference between the fair value of the june and july bridge loans at their date of issue and their face value at the time of repayment in october the bridge notes were repaid in conjunction with our october private placement 
other income expense  net 
other income primarily includes gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions 
other income for the year ended december  also included million from the sale of intellectual property

this increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher costs in for our new amr cardiovascular program  which included costs associated with our two planned phase iii clinical trials  increases in mystic  ct based staffing to support these cardiovascular trials and clinical trial start up costs incurred with medpace 
stock based compensation expense included within research and development was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash change in fair value of ester share based liability for the year ended december  reflects the change in the fair value from december  to the may settlement date of the liability associated with milestone ia of the ester share purchase agreement

restructuring  severance and lease exit costs for the period ended december  includes a charge of million reflecting accrued costs for leased office space no longer used 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  was income of million  versus income of million in the prior year 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  is primarily related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the october private placement 
in october the company issued approximately million warrants at an exercise price of and recognized million for the fair value of the warrant derivative liability 
as these warrants have been classified as a liability  they are revalued at each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants at december  was million and the company recognized a million gain on change in fair value of derivative liability related to these warrants for year ended december  loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  also included changes in fair value for three other derivative liabilities  the total net gain on changes in fair value for derivative liabilities was million 
see further discussion of the derivative liability in note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december  we recognized a million gain on change in fair value of a derivative liability associated with the fair value changes of two derivative liabilities 
a gain on change in fair value of a derivative liability of million was recorded in conjunction with a decrease in fair value of a derivative associated with a variable pricing feature of warrants issued in december in addition  we recognized a million gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities for a decrease in the fair value of a derivative liability associated with a financing participation option granted in conjunction with the may financing 
interest income expense  net 
interest income includes interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million versus million in the prior year period 
the increase was due primarily to the amortization of the difference between the fair value of the june and july bridge loans at their date of issue and their face value at the time of repayment 
the bridge loans were repaid in conjunction with our october private placement 
other income expense  net 
other income includes gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions 
other income for the year ended december  included million from the sale of intellectual property 
other expense for the year ended december  was due primarily to foreign exchange losses 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity as of december  include cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition  in january we completed an equity offering from which we received approximately million in net proceeds 
our projected uses of cash include the completion of our two phase iii clinical trials for amr  the submission of an nda  commercial preparation of amr  working capital and other general corporate activities 
our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in millions 
table of contents years ended december  cash used in provided by continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we had no debt obligations at december  in january  we sold million shares of our common shares  par value per share  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and expenses payable by us associated with this transaction 
we believe that our cash  including the net proceeds from the january financing  will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for the next twelve months which contemplates not only working capital and general corporate needs but also  including the filing of an nda and commercial preparations for amr  working capital and other general corporate activities 
this is based on our current operational plans and activities at normal levels and does not assume any cash inflows from partnerships  warrant exercises or other dilutive or non dilutive financings in the longer term 
if we elect to commercialize amr ourselves  rather than through a partner  or decide to commence an outcome study  we will need additional funds to complete such activities 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total to to after contractual obligations purchase obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations represents minimum purchase obligations under a supplier agreement with a japan based supplier 
not included in this obligation is a non refundable milestone payment of million payable upon the first marketing approval of amr in the united states 
additional future minimum purchases will be required  subject to an nda approval  and in preparation for commercialization of amr we may purchase more than the minimum amount 
in addition  provided the supplier has expanded its manufacturing capacity in accordance with the agreement  the supplier may terminate the agreement in the event that i amarin does not receive marketing approval for amr in the united states on or before december  or ii in the event that amarin abandons development of amr for hypertriglyceridemia in the united states 
in either case  amarin will be required to reimburse the supplier for certain costs incurred by the supplier in connection with its 
table of contents manufacturing expansion  less the amount of profit received as a result of purchases of ethyl epa by amarin  not to exceed million 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in addition to the obligations in the table above  we have approximately million of gross liability for uncertain tax positions that have been recorded as liabilities at december  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
the above table does not reflect our contract with medpace for the conduct of our two registration trials for amr we anticipate paying an additional million to medpace in prior to the completion of this contract  of which approximately was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december  we may incur some capital costs from time to time to support our office facilities 
in we expect to rent office space in new jersey to establish our us sales and marketing headquarters 
during  we amended our contract with a third party manufacturer and we anticipate incurring certain costs associated with the qualification of product produced by this manufacturer 
in an effort to further expand production capacity at this manufacturer or through the addition of supplemental manufacturers  we may make capital commitments to support their expansion  particularly if such commitments further reduce the cost to us of the manufactured product 
under our share repurchase agreement with laxdale limited  in connection with commercialization of amr for cardiovascular indications  prior to the end of we are required to pay potential royalties of royalty on net sales up to million million  for net sales between million million and million  and for sales in excess of million million 
in addition  upon receipt of marketing approval in the united states 
and or europe for the first indication for amr or any product containing amarin neuroscience intellectual property acquired from laxdale limited in  we must make an aggregate stock or cash payment at the sole option of each of the sellers of million million for each of the two potential market approvals ie million maximum  or million 
in addition  upon receipt of a marketing approval in the united states or europe for any other product using amarin neuroscience intellectual property or for a different indication of a previously approved product  we must make an aggregate stock or cash payment at the sole option of each of the sellers of million million for each of the two potential market approvals ie million maximum  or million 
we were previously subject to a potential royalty payable to scarista limited 
in november we reached agreement with scarista in which we returned certain central nervous system related intellectual property rights to scarista and in return the potential royalty obligation was terminated 
no provision has been made for these contingencies at december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
shelf registration statement we have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement on form f registration no 
 which provides for the offer  from time to time  of common shares  preferred shares  or senior or subordinated debt securities up to an aggregate availability of approximately million  or the equivalent denominated in foreign currencies 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective on november  in connection with our public offering in january  we issued and sold million american 
table of contents depositary shares  or adss  each representing one share of our common stock 
the price per each ads in the offering was  which resulted in gross proceeds of million and estimated net proceeds of million 
we believe that having an effective shelf registration statement is prudent for providing us with financial flexibility 
from time to time  including but not limited to after the filing of this annual report on form k  we may file a new shelf registration statement to increase our potential access to capital 
the addition of these securities  if issued  into the market may be dilutive to existing stockholders and have an adverse effect on the price of our securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in credit worthiness and liquidity of our marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the euro and sterling 
the majority of our vendor relationships  including our contract with our medpace  are denominated in us dollar 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk through market value fluctuations of balance sheet items ie price risk or through changes in interest income or expenses ie re financing or re investment risk 
interest rate risk mainly arises through interest bearing liabilities and assets 
we invest funds not needed for near term operating expenses in diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of december   the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents maturing in one year or less was million and represented of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our securities due to the general short term nature of our investment portfolio 
at december   and there was no outstanding debt 
we record as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock issued to investors 
the fair value of this warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the market price of our common stock based on the market price of our stock at december  on which the december  valuation was based  the value would have increased by million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on revaluation of the warrant liability in our statement of operations
