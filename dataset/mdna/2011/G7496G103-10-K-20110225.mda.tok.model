item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
corporate strategy our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders by being a trusted  long term partner to our customers  for assessing and managing risk  delivering responsive solutions  and keeping our promises 
our aspiration is to be the world s best underwriter of high severity  low frequency risks 
our vision is to be a leader in select financial services through our people and culture  expertise in risk  and passion for exceeding customers expectations 
since our inception  we have cultivated and endeavor to preserve certain competitive advantages that position us to fulfill our strategic objectives 
we believe these competitive advantages include superior risk selection 
we seek to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive return on utilized capital 
we develop a perspective on the risk in each business opportunity using both our underwriters expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques including computer models and databases  such as renaissance exposure management system rems 
we pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and select only risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
we manage our portfolio of risks dynamically  both within sub portfolios and across the company 

table of contents superior customer relationships 
we believe our modeling and technical expertise  and the risk management advice that we provide our customers  has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide 
we seek to offer stable  predictable  and consistent risk based pricing and a prompt turnaround on our claims 
superior capital management 
we seek to write as much attractively priced business as is available to us and then manage our capital accordingly 
we generally seek to raise capital when we forecast an increased demand in the market  at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures  and seek to return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture investors 
in using joint ventures  we intend to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base  develop fee income  generate profit commissions and diversify our portfolio 
we routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture opportunities and strategic investments 
we believe we are well positioned to fulfill these objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team  our significant financial strength  and our strong relationships with brokers and customers 
in addition  we believe our superior service  our proprietary modeling technology  and our extensive business relationships  which have enabled us to become a leader in the property catastrophe reinsurance market  will be instrumental in allowing us to achieve our strategic objectives 
in particular  we believe our strategy  high performance culture  and commitment to our customers and joint venture partners permit us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited 
business segments reinsurance segment our reinsurance segment is comprised of two main units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci 
our reinsurance segment is managed by the global chief underwriting officer  who leads a team of underwriters  risk modelers and other industry professionals  who have access to our proprietary risk management  underwriting and modeling resources and tools 
we believe the expertise of our underwriting and modeling team and our proprietary analytic tools  together with superior customer service  provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business  although no current relationship exceeds of our gross premiums written 
accordingly  our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through brokers  whose market has become extremely consolidated in recent years 
in  three brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written 
we believe that recent market dynamics  and trends in our industry in respect of potential future consolidation  have increased our exposure to the risks of broker  client and counterparty concentration 

table of contents the following table shows our total reinsurance segment gross premiums written split between catastrophe and specialty reinsurance  respectively year ended december  in thousands renaissance catastrophe premiums renaissance specialty premiums total renaissance premiums davinci catastrophe premiums davinci specialty premiums total davinci premiums total catastrophe unit premiums total specialty unit premiums total reinsurance segment premiums total catastrophe premiums written includes million  million and million of gross premiums written assumed from our insurance segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
property catastrophe reinsurance we believe we are one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  based on our total catastrophe gross premiums written 
our principal property catastrophe reinsurance products include catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance and excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance as described below 
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we principally write catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  which means we provide coverage to our insureds when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we also write retrocessional reinsurance contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance  which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
we offer our coverages on a worldwide basis 

table of contents because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  including the size of such events and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
insurance linked securities 
we also invest in insurance linked securities 
insurance linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities as to which all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events  for example  the occurrence of one or more hurricanes or earthquakes producing industry losses exceeding certain specified thresholds 
we underwrite  model  evaluate and monitor these securities using similar tools and techniques used to evaluate our more traditional property catastrophe reinsurance business assumed 
in addition  we may enter into derivative transactions  such as total return swaps  that are based on or referenced to underlying insurance linked securities 
based on an evaluation of the specific features of each insurance linked security  we account for these securities as reinsurance or at fair value  as applicable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for insurance linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverage attractive 
we seek to moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio through superior risk selection  diversification and the purchase of retrocessional coverages and other protections 
in furtherance of our strategy  we may increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk adjusted pricing adequacy 
we frequently seek to purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results 
as a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer relationships  we believe we have superior access to reinsurance business we view as desirable compared to the market as a whole 
as described above  we use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities 
we dynamically model policy submissions against our current in force underwriting portfolio  comparing our estimate of the modeled expected returns of the contract against the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract  based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall risk portfolio 
at times  our approach to portfolio management has resulted and may result in the future in our having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region  such as florida  or to a particular peril  such as us hurricane risk  where we believe supply and demand characteristics promote our providing significant capacity  or where the risks or class of risks otherwise adds efficiency to our portfolio 
conversely  from time to time we may have a disproportionately low market share in certain regions or perils where we believe our capital would be less effectively deployed 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance other than property catastrophe  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  financial  mortgage guarantee  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance that we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business 
as with our catastrophe business  our team of experienced professionals seek to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools 
we are seeking to expand our specialty reinsurance operations over time  although we cannot assure you that we will do so  particularly in light of current and forecasted market conditions 
we generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
furthermore  we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio  including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events 
we believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 

table of contents we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance products  and also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
the reinsurer pays the cedant a commission which is generally based on the cedant s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured including commissions  premium taxes  assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses and may also include a profit factor 
our products frequently include tailored features such as limits or sub limits which we believe help us manage our exposures 
any liability exceeding  or otherwise not subject to  such limits reverts to the cedant 
as with our catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 
we generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties 
as a result of our financial strength  we have the ability to offer significant capacity and  for select risks  we have made available significant limits 
we believe these capabilities  the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team  and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business 
while we believe that these and other initiatives will support growth in our specialty reinsurance unit  we intend to continue to apply our disciplined underwriting approach which  together with currently prevailing market conditions  is likely to temper such growth in current and near term term periods 
ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
we also provide customized weather and energy risk management solutions to various customers on a worldwide basis 
property catastrophe managed joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with an additional presence in the market  enhance our client relationships and generate fee income and profit commissions 
these joint ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
currently  our joint ventures include top layer re and davinci 
renaissance underwriting managers  ltd 
rum  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures 
davinci was established in and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain low frequency  high severity specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio and certain lines of specialty reinsurance such as terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers compensation 
in accordance with davinci s underwriting guidelines  it can only participate in business that is underwritten by renaissance reinsurance 
we maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  consolidate the results of davincire into our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we seek to manage davinci s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve 
our ownership in davincire was and at december  and  respectively 
in january  davincire redeemed shares from certain davincire shareholders  and as a result  our ownership interest in davincire increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by renaissance reinsurance 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
we account for our equity ownership in top layer re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results is reflected in equity in losses earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated in and continuously analyze other attractive opportunities in the market for insurance linked securities and derivatives 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management objectives 

table of contents strategic investments 
ventures also pursues strategic investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
examples of these investments include our investments in tower hill insurance group  llc thig  tower hill claims services  llc thcs and tower hill claims management  llc thcm collectively  the tower hill companies  which operate primarily in the state of florida  essent group ltd 
essent and angus fund lp the angus fund 
thig is a managing general agency specializing in insurance coverage for site built and manufactured homes 
thcs and thcm provide claim adjustment services through exclusive agreements with thig 
during the third quarter of  we invested million in the tower hill companies  representing a ownership interest  to expand our core platforms by obtaining ownership in an additional distribution channel for the florida homeowners market and to enhance our relationships with other stakeholders 
essent provides mortgage insurance and reinsurance coverage for mortgages located in the us weather and energy risk management operations 
we provide energy related risk management solutions and financial products primarily through renaissance trading and real and sell certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engage in certain weather  energy and commodity derivatives trading activities 
certain of these trading activities require the physical delivery of energy related commodities  including natural gas 
we expect that our participation will increase in the trading markets for securities and derivatives linked to energy  commodities  weather  other natural phenomena  and or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena 
while our activities focus on financial products that allow various energy  utility and other customers to manage their exposures to energy related commodities  we expect our own results in this area to potentially be volatile over time 
as this unit grows  we intend to seek to continue to invest in operating and control environment systems and procedures  hire staff and develop and install management information and other systems 
accordingly  costs related to these operational investments increased in and may increase in the future 
business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of our investments  such as top layer re and our weather and energy related activities and other ventures are included in the other category of our segment results 
lloyd s segment our lloyd s segment includes reinsurance and insurance business written through syndicate syndicate started writing certain lines of insurance and reinsurance business incepting on or after june  the syndicate was established to enhance our underwriting platform by providing access to lloyd s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses 
renaissancere corporate capital uk limited renaissancere ccl  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is the sole corporate member of syndicate the results of syndicate were not significant to our overall consolidated results of operations and financial position during  however  we anticipate that syndicate s absolute and relative contributions to our consolidated results of operations may have a meaningful impact over time 
syndicate generally targets lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe and specialty reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and to write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
furthermore  we seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio  including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events 
we believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 
we offer a range of insurance and reinsurance products including  but not limited to  direct and facultative property  property catastrophe  agriculture  medical malpractice  professional indemnity  political risk and trade credit 
as with our catastrophe and specialty reinsurance business  we frequently provide coverage for relatively large limits or exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 

table of contents insurance segment the insurance segment includes the insurance policies previously written in connection with our bermuda based insurance operations which are not being sold pursuant to the stock purchase agreement with qbe and have effectively been put into runoff 
our insurance segment is managed by our global chief underwriting officer 
the bermuda based insurance business is written by glencoe  a bermuda domiciled excess and surplus lines insurance company that is currently eligible to do business on an excess and surplus lines basis in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
although we are not actively underwriting new business in the insurance segment  we may from time to time evaluate potential opportunities for the insurance segment 
other our other category primarily includes the results of our share of strategic investments in certain markets we believe offer attractive risk adjusted returns or where we believe our investment adds value  such as our investments in the tower hill companies  essent group ltd 
and the angus fund  where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we partner with other market participants  our weather and energy risk management operations primarily through renaissance trading and real  our investment unit which manages and invests the funds generated by our consolidated operations  and corporate expenses  capital servicing costs and noncontrolling interests 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we believe that competition is in general increasing and becoming more robust 
our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries and or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies  reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
hedge funds  investment banks  exchanges and other capital market participants continue to show interest in entering the reinsurance market  in light of the continuing recovery in the financial markets 
in addition  we continue to anticipate further  and perhaps accelerating  growth in financial products such as exchange traded catastrophe options  insurance linked securities  unrated privately held reinsurance companies providing collateralized reinsurance  catastrophe linked derivative agreements and other financial products  intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
we believe that competition from non traditional sources such as these will increase in the future 
many of these competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our customers operate  as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds  affect demand for reinsurance  sometimes significantly 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks for which we seek to provide coverage 
ratings financial strength ratings are an important factor in respect of the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies 
rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our reinsurers and insurers 
we continue to receive high claims paying and financial strength ratings from am best co 
am best  standard poor s rating agency s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings ltd 
fitch 
these ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations  and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any of our securities

table of contents underwriting and enterprise risk management underwriting our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders equity  subject to prudent risk constraints  and to generate long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends 
we assess each new re insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 
we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting and modeling experience  adding proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of utilized capital which the program presents 
we utilize a multiple model and multiple risk approach combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques 
the underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and rems framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available models 
we use commercially available natural hazard catastrophe models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and rems results 
we continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural hazard and non natural hazard models in rems and while our experience is most developed for analyzing natural hazard catastrophe risks  we continue to make significant advances in our capabilities for assessing non natural hazards catastrophe risks 
we believe that rems is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and culture 
before we bind a reinsurance risk  exposure data  historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers 
using a combination of proprietary software  underwriting experience  actuarial techniques and engineering expertise where appropriate  the exposure data is reviewed and augmented 
we use this data as primary inputs into the rems modeling system as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk being evaluated 
we believe that the rems modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis  assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
operationally  on a deal by deal basis  our models employ simulation techniques that have the ability to generate  years of loss activity 
when deemed necessary  we stress test the  year simulations with simulations of up to  years 
at a consolidated level  we routinely utilize simulations of  years to incorporate investment risk  expense risk and operational risk at a portfolio and risk assuming entity level 
for natural hazards  we have modeled certain simulated events in excess of billion in insured industry losses 
from this simulation  we generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each policy in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
in part  through the process described above and the utilization of rems  we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital that we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in commercially available models 
we periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in rems and our other tools 
for example  in the second half of we assessed recent us geological survey research updates and independently evaluated and revised our assumptions relating to us earthquake risks 
in  we revised our assumptions on atlantic basin hurricane frequency and severity 
the publicly available commercial catastrophe models historically base their frequency and severity distributions on the last years of hurricane activity  assuming that this time frame is an appropriate framework on which to base estimates of the hurricane risk to which the insurance industry is exposed 
we currently do not believe  based on our review of the scientific literature  private research  and discussions with climatologists  meteorologists and other weather scientists  including those at weather predict  that the past years of data is reflective of current climatological risks 
in 
table of contents particular  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  climate  or both  or other factors 
our underwriters use this combination of our risk assessment and underwriting process  rems and other tools in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability to simulate a range of potential outcomes that adequately represents the risk to an individual contract  analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio  better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business  price contracts within a short time frame  capture various classes of risk  including catastrophe and other insurance risks  assess risk across multiple entities including our various joint ventures and across different components of our capital structure  and provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
our underwriting and risk management process  in conjunction with rems  quantifies and manages our exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant  the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share  historical loss data for the cedant and  where available  for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions  in order to compare the cedant s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages  the cedant s pricing strategies  and the perceived financial strength of the cedant and factors such as the cedant s historical record of making premium payments in full and on a timely basis 
in order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non natural hazard reinsurance ie lines of business within our specialty unit  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation and terrorism  we seek to directly leverage our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and therefore less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources  including recent historical experience  and the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use for our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio 

table of contents enterprise risk management we believe that high quality and effective risk management is best achieved through it being a shared cultural value throughout the organization 
we have sought to develop and utilize a series of tools and processes that support a culture of risk management and to create a robust framework of erm within our organization 
we consider erm to be a key process which is the responsibility of every individual within the company 
erm is managed by our senior executive team under the oversight of our board of directors  and implemented by personnel from across our organization 
we believe that erm helps us to identify potential events that may affect us  to quantify  evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed  and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives 
we believe that effective erm can provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
we also believe that effective erm assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments  underwriting decisions  or other operating or business activities  although we do not believe this risk can be eliminated 
we believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify opportunities that we believe to be the most attractive 
in particular  we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital position  on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries  and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support the risks that we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries 
we believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our shareholders 
our erm framework comprises three primary areas of focus  as set forth below assumed risk 
we define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against the company s capital base  including underwriting risks and other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk as they relate to investments  ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk  each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques 
of these  we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us 
in order to understand  monitor  quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk  we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to  among other things  estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities  and estimate the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile 
we use the tools and methods described above in underwriting to seek to achieve these objectives 
embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of the company s aggregate risk profile 
in part through the utilization of rems and our other systems and procedures  we seek to analyze our in force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis 
we believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures  as well as to rigorously analyze individual proposed transactions and evaluate them in the context of our in force portfolio 
this aggregation process captures line of business  segment and corporate risk profiles  calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance 
generally  additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk  credit risk  capital adequacy and liquidity 
this information is used in day to day decision making for underwriting  investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and in respect of our consolidated financial position 
business environment risk 
we define this as the risk of changes in the business  political or regulatory environment that could negatively impact our short term or long term financial results or the markets in which we operate 
accordingly  these risks are predominately extrinsic to the company and in general  our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited 
rather  our efforts focus on monitoring developments  assessing potential impacts of any such changes  and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of and ensure compliance with any new requirements applicable to us 
operational risk 
we believe we are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational  regulatory  and other matters 
we define operational risk as the risk that we fail to create  manage  control or mitigate the people  processes  structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk  and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us 
in light of the rapid evolution 
table of contents of our markets  business environment  and business initiatives  we seek to continually invest in the tools  processes and procedures to cost effectively mitigate our exposure to operational risk 
identification and monitoring of business environment risk and operational risk is coordinated by senior personnel including our chief financial officer cfo  general counsel and chief compliance officer cco  corporate controller and chief accounting officer cao  chief administrative officer  chief risk officer cro and internal audit  utilizing resources throughout the company 
although financial reporting is a key area of our focus  other operational risks are addressed through our disaster recovery program  human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent  our strict tax protocols and our legal and regulatory policies and procedures 
controls and compliance committee 
we believe that a key component of our current operational risk management platform is our controls and compliance committee 
the controls and compliance committee is comprised of our cfo  cco  cao  chief administrative officer  cro  staff compliance professionals and representatives from our business units 
the purpose of the controls and compliance committee is to establish  assess the effectiveness of  and enforce policies  procedures and practices relating to accounting  financial reporting  internal controls  regulatory  legal  compliance and related matters  for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations  the company s code of ethics and conduct the code of ethics  and other relevant standards 
in addition  the controls and compliance committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially contain complex and or significant underwriting  tax  legal  accounting  regulatory  reporting  reputational or compliance issues 
ongoing development and enhancement 
we frequently seek to accurately capture  reflect and categorize risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions  even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks  such as catastrophe and market risks 
we also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks 
we believe effective risk management is a core attribute of our culture and is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development 
we seek from time to time to identify new best practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors 
we believe that our ongoing efforts to embed erm throughout our organization are important to our efforts to produce and maintain a competitive advantage to achieve our corporate goals 
geographic breakdown our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones  but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities 
the company s largest exposure has historically been to the us and caribbean property catastrophe market  which represented of the company s gross premiums written for the year ended december  a significant amount of our us and caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms  mainly us atlantic hurricanes  as well as earthquakes and other natural and man made catastrophes

reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance lloyd s insurance total at december  in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance insurance total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments that cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the year ended december   changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million million  million  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax benefit expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our consolidated financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 

table of contents we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the us in in  we recorded million  million and million of gross claims and claim expenses as a result of losses arising from the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and the australian flooding  respectively 
our estimates of losses from these events are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
the uncertainty of our estimates for these events is additionally impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available  the magnitude and relative infrequency of the events  the expected duration of the respective claims development period  inadequacies in the data provided thus far by industry participants and the potential for further reporting lags or insufficiencies particularly in respect of the chilean and new zealand earthquakes the earthquakes  and in the case of the australian flooding  significant uncertainty as to the form of the claims and legal issues including  but not limited to  the number  nature and fiscal periods of the loss events under the relevant terms of insurance contracts and reinsurance treaties 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  and the continuing uncertainty relating to the large storms of  especially hurricane katrina  and those of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates 
while we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our property catastrophe reinsurance  specialty reinsurance and insurance businesses within our reinsurance and lloyd s segment

marketing we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  the risk management advice that we provide to our customers  and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide 
we market our products worldwide primarily through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and partners 
we believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and  therefore  we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers 
we target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business 
we believe that primary insurers and brokers willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing  but also on the financial security of the reinsurer  its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims  the quality of a reinsurer s service  the reinsurer s willingness and ability to design customized programs  its long term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance capacity 
we believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance contracts  we can establish terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and customers 
our brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
in recent years  our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small and relatively decreasing number of such relationships reflecting consolidation in the broker sector 
we expect this concentration to continue and perhaps

employees at february   we employed approximately people worldwide february   february  
we believe our strong employee relations are among our most significant strengths 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries 
the company has historically looked for opportunities to strengthen its operations during periods of softening markets in anticipation of improving market conditions  however  we may from time to time reevaluate our operational needs based on various factors  including the changing nature of such market conditions 
at february   approximately employees were employed in the us based insurance operations expected to be sold in early  and as a result we expect our overall headcount to decrease accordingly 
however  we expect to continue to experience employee growth in the uk and other highly regulated markets  which will increase our compliance complexity and expenses  although we do not expect these increases to be material to the company as a whole 

table of contents information technology our information technology infrastructure is important to our business 
our information technology platform  supported by a team of professionals  is currently principally located in our corporate headquarters and principal corporate offices in bermuda 
additional information technology assets are maintained at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries 
we have implemented backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are backed up  generally on a daily basis  and can be restored promptly if and as needed 
in addition  we generally store backup information at off site locations  in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster 
we have implemented and periodically test our disaster recovery plans with respect to our information technology infrastructure 
among other things  our recovery plans involve arrangements with off site  secure data centers in alternative locations 
we believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a scenario such as a natural disaster 
regulation us regulation dodd frank act 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act which effects sweeping reforms of the financial services industries 
the dodd frank act does not implement the federal regulation of insurance  but it does establish federal measures that will impact the us insurance business and preempt certain state insurance measures 
it may then lay the foundation for ultimately establishing some form of federal regulation of insurance in the future 
the dodd frank act establishes the financial services oversight council the fsoc to identify risks to the financial stability of the us  promote market discipline and respond to emerging threats to the financial stability of the us the fsoc will determine whether the material financial distress or failure of a non bank financial company  including insurance companies  would threaten the financial stability of the us the fsoc s determination that a non bank financial company is systemically significant will result in supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve and the imposition of standards and supervision including stress tests  liquidity requirements  a resolution plan and enhanced public disclosures 
the fsoc has released a proposed rule regarding its authority to require the supervision and regulation of systemically significant non bank financial companies 
a final rule and designations of systemically significant financial companies are expected later this year 
the fsoc s recommendation of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our us based insurance and reinsurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant and subject to supervision by the federal reserve 
the dodd frank act also creates the first office in the federal government focused on insurance the federal insurance office the fio 
although the fio has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements  the dodd frank act does not grant the fio general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance 
certain functions of the fio relate to systemic risk 
specifically  the fio is authorized to monitor the us insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk to the insurance industry and the us financial system 
in addition  the fio shall recommend insurers for supervision by the fsoc 
with respect to certain aspects of international insurance regulations  the fio will represent the us at the international association of insurance supervisors 
the dodd frank act authorizes the treasury secretary and us trade representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance covered agreements 
significantly  the fio is authorized to preempt state measures that i are inconsistent with a covered agreement and ii disfavor non us insurers subject to a covered agreement 
in furtherance of its duties to monitor the us insurance business  represent the us on an international stage and consult with the states on insurance regulation  the fio is authorized to collect information from insurers and from state insurance regulators 
the fio will report to congress annually on the insurance industry and any 
table of contents preemption actions regarding covered agreements 
the fio will also report to congress no later than september  describing the breadth of the global reinsurance market and its critical role in supporting the us insurance system 
in addition  by january  the fio shall report to congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the us including considerations of international coordination of insurance regulation 
the potential impact of the dodd frank act on our us cedants and on the us treatment of global reinsurance matters is not clear at this time 
we are monitoring developments at the fsoc and the fio in connection with the possible impact on our us insurance and reinsurance business 
the dodd frank act also provides for the specific preemption of certain state insurance laws in the areas of reinsurance and surplus insurance regulation described herein 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the dodd frank act or the resulting regulations will impact our business 
however  compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs  which may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
although we do not expect these costs to be material to us as a whole  we cannot be certain that this expectation will prove accurate or that the dodd frank act will not impact our business more adversely than we currently estimate 
reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures principally consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer re and glencoe 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although none of these companies is admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  contract terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance under the following circumstances if the contract contains certain minimum provisions if the reinsurer is licensed or accredited  if the reinsurer is domiciled in a state with substantially similar regulatory requirements as the primary insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction and meets certain financial requirements  or if the reinsurance obligations are collateralized appropriately 
recently new york and florida have changed their credit for reinsurance laws 
for example  effective january   new york requires domestic ceding insurers to exercise prudent reinsurance credit risk management 
for a new york domestic ceding insurer to exercise financial prudence when entering into any reinsurance arrangement  it must take into account the recoverability of future reinsurance proceeds and the security of a reinsurer 
domestic ceding insurers are also required to monitor reinsurance programs 
new york law also establishes a basis for an unauthorized non us reinsurer to reduce its reinsurance collateral obligations based on a secure rating assigned by the new york insurance department 
a similar provision was enacted in florida 
the dodd frank act also addresses states extraterritorial regulation of credit for reinsurance and the solvency regulation of us reinsurers 
the dodd frank act prohibits a state in which a us ceding insurer is licensed  but not domiciled  from denying credit for reinsurance if the ceding insurer s domestic state recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer s ceded risk and is a state accredited by the national association of insurance commissioners the naic or has substantially similar financial solvency requirements 
with limited exceptions  the provisions of the dodd frank act affecting reinsurance become effective july  as alien companies  our bermuda subsidiaries collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
states are expected to change their credit for reinsurance laws to comply with dodd frank act requirements 
although these changes may benefit our bermuda based reinsurers by prohibiting states extraterritorial application of credit for reinsurance laws and streamlining the credit for reinsurance process  states may also impose heightened standards on us ceding insurers reinsurance selections which could have an adverse impact on our business 
at this time  we are unable to determine the effect of changes in the us reinsurance regulatory framework on our operations or financial condition 

table of contents with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
none of renaissance reinsurance  davinci or top layer re intends to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction  other than bermuda  where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe  domiciled in bermuda  is not licensed in the us but is eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which it is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance 
in accordance with certain provisions of the naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe has established  and is required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us under the dodd frank act  effective july   the states are required to amend their laws to provide that any insurer listed on the naic iid quarterly listing is eligible in the state as a surplus lines insurer 
glencoe is listed on the naic iid quarterly listing 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
in  the florida supreme court held that surplus lines insurers were subject to insurance law provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  the payment of attorney fees and other matters  however  in  the florida legislature passed fl sb and hb to clarify the limited applicability of florida insurance law to surplus lines insurers exempt from the provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  etc this case could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
any increase in our regulatory burden may impact our operations and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the us continues to evolve 
although us state regulation is currently the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance  in addition to changes brought about by the dodd frank act  congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter  repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act  and tax law changes  including changes to increase the taxation of reinsurance premiums paid to off shore affiliates with respect to us risks 
we are unable to predict what reforms will be proposed or adopted or the effect  if any  that such reforms would have on our operations and financial condition 
in  florida enacted legislation which enabled the fhcf to offer increased amounts of coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage amount  at below market rates 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of the state sponsored insurer  citizens  to compete with private insurance companies  and other companies that cede business to us 
this legislation reduced the role of the private insurance and reinsurance markets in florida  a key target market of ours 
in may  the florida legislature took steps to strengthen the financial condition of fhcf and citizens  which a government appointed task force determined to have been impaired by issues including the crisis in the credit markets  widespread rate inadequacy  and issues arising out of the application of discounts for housing retrofits and mitigation features 
a bill was passed in permitting citizens to raise its rates by up to starting in and every year thereafter until its current shortfall is corrected and citizens has sufficient funds to pay its claims and expenses 
for  the approved rate increase for citizens was approximately 
this legislation also increased the rates charged by the fhcf for certain portions of its expanded coverage  and provided for incremental staged reductions in the amount of the expanded coverage layers 
it is possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the earlier florida precedent  or may otherwise enact legislation which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or federal level 
for example  in the past  federal bills have been proposed in congress and  in prior congressional sessions  passed by the house of representatives which would  if enacted  create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks  including those we currently insure and reinsure in the private markets 
in the catastrophe obligation guarantee act was introduced in the senate and house s 
the coga to federally guarantee bond issuances by certain government entities  potentially including the fhcf  the texas windstorm insurance association  the california earthquake authority  and others 
similar legislation was introduced in the house of 
table of contents representatives 
if enacted  this legislation or legislation similar to these proposals  in import would  we believe  likely contribute to growth of these state entities or to their inception or alteration in a manner adverse to us 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation would be vigorously opposed if introduced in  if enacted these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of citizens and of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
the potential for further expansion into additional insurance markets could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight  including the oversight of countries other than bermuda and the us however  we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer re  glencoe  or any of our other bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct us regulation 
in addition  as discussed above  real and renaissance trading are involved in certain commodities trading activities relating to weather  natural gas  heating oil  power  crude oil  agricultural commodities and cross commodity structures 
while real s and renaissance trading s operations currently are not subject to significant federal oversight  we are monitoring carefully new or revised legislation or regulation in the us or otherwise  which could increase the regulatory burden and operating expenses of these operations 
for example  certain provisions of the dodd frank act will establish greater oversight over derivatives trading and could impose restrictions on the company s trading activities 
bermuda regulation all bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the companies act in addition  the insurance act  and related regulations the insurance act  regulate the business of our bermuda insurance  reinsurance and management company subsidiaries 
as a holding company  renaissancere is not currently subject to the insurance act 
however  the insurance act regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of our operating insurance companies 
the company s most significant operating subsidiaries include renaissance reinsurance and davinci which are registered as class general business insurers and glencoe and top layer re which are registered as class a general business insurers under the insurance act 
rum is registered as an insurance manager 
the insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the bermuda monetary authority bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
significant requirements of the insurance act include the appointment of an independent auditor and loss reserve specialist both of whom must be approved by the bma  the filing of an annual financial return and provisions relating to the payment of distributions and dividends 
in particular class a and class general business insurers must prepare annual statutory financial statements which must be submitted as part of its statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the annual statutory financial statements give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance  reserves and investments 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements  a declaration of statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist  and details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
in addition to preparing statutory financial statements  all class insurers must prepare financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with gaap or international financial reporting standards ifrs 

table of contents an insurer s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount  greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin  which varies with the category of its registration and net premiums written and loss reserves posted minimum solvency margin 
the minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a class insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class a insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of the first million of net premiums written  if in excess of million  the figure is million plus of net premiums written in excess of million  or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
in addition  each class insurer must maintain its capital at a level equal to its enhanced capital requirement ecr which is established by reference to the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr model 
alternatively  under the insurance act  insurers may  subject to the terms of the insurance act and to the bma s oversight  elect to utilize an approved internal capital model to determine regulatory capital 
in either case  the ecr shall at all times equal or exceed the class insurer s minimum solvency margin and may be adjusted in circumstances where the bma concludes that the insurer s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ecr or the insurer s assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ecr applicable to it 
while not specifically referred to in the insurance act  the bma has also established a target capital level tcl for each class insurer equal to of its ecr 
while a class insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level  the tcl serves as an early warning tool for the bma and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the tcl will likely result in increased bma regulatory oversight 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities minimum liquidity ratio 
both class a and class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the prior approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class a and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
the bma maintains supervision over the controllers as defined herein of all bermuda registered insurers 
currently the insurance act states that no person shall become a controller of any description of a registered insurer unless he has first served the bma notice in writing stating that he intends to become such a controller and the bma has either  before the end of days following the date of notification  provided notice to the proposed controller that it does not object to his becoming such a controller or the full days has elapsed without the authority filing an objection 
a controller includes the managing director and chief executive of the registered insurer or its parent company  a   or shareholder controller  and any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act 
in addition  all bermuda insurers are also required to give the bma written notice of the fact that a person has become  or ceased to be  a controller or officer of the registered insurer within days of becoming aware of such fact 
an officer in relation to a registered insurer includes a director  secretary  chief executive or senior executive by whatever name called 

table of contents where it appears to the bma that a person who is a controller of any description of a registered person is not or is no longer a fit and proper person to be such a controller  it may serve him with a written notice of objection to his being such a controller of the registered person 
all bermuda insurers will be required to comply with the bma s insurance code of conduct which establishes duties  requirements and standards to be complied with under the insurance act 
the deadline for compliance with the insurance code of conduct is currently anticipated to be effective july  failure to comply with these requirements will be a factor taken into account by the bma in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner under the insurance act 
in march  the insurance act was amended to empower the bma to exercise group wide supervision 
for purposes of the insurance act  an insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts exclusively  or mainly  insurance business 
as group supervisor  the bma will perform a number of supervisory functions including  among other things  carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of the insurance group and its compliance with the rules on solvency  risk concentration  intra group transactions and good governance procedures  planning and coordinating  with other competent authorities  supervisory activities in respect of the insurance group  and coordinating enforcement actions to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members 
in carrying out its functions  the bma may make rules for assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and or its members and for regulating intra group transactions  risk concentration  governance procedures  risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure 
if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interests of an insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders  it may appoint an inspector who has extensive powers of investigation 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to holding companies  subsidiaries and other affiliates of insurers 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of an insurer becoming insolvent  or that the insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions of its registration  the bma may exercise extensive powers of intervention including directing the insurer not to take on any new insurance business or prohibiting the company from declaring and paying dividends or other distributions 
under the provisions of the insurance act  the bma may  from time to time  conduct on site visits at the offices of insurers it regulates 
the bma may cancel an insurer s registration on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including without limitation  i the failure of that insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or ii the failure of that insurer in the opinion of the bma to carry on its business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
uk regulation lloyd s regulation general 
the operations of renaissancere syndicate management ltd 
rsml  formerly known as spectrum syndicate management ltd  are franchised by lloyd s 
the lloyd s franchise board was formally constituted on january  the franchise board is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the lloyd s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all syndicates 
rsml s business plan for syndicate requires annual approval by the lloyd s franchise board including maximum underwriting capacity  and the lloyd s franchise board may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan 
lloyd s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members 
if material changes in the business plan for syndicate were required by the lloyd s franchise board  or if charges and assessments payable to lloyd s by renaissancere ccl were to increase significantly  these events could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial results of rsml 
the company has deposited certain assets with lloyd s to support renaissancere ccl s underwriting business at 
table of contents lloyd s 
dividends from a lloyd s managing agent and a lloyd s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution 
by entering into a membership agreement with lloyd s  renaissancere ccl has undertaken to comply with all lloyd s bye laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the lloyd s acts and the financial services and markets act the fsma that are applicable to it 
capital requirements 
the underwriting capacity of a member of lloyd s must be supported by providing a deposit referred to as funds at lloyd s in the form of cash  securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the individual capital adequacy regime of the uk s financial services authority the fsa 
the amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise 
under these requirements  lloyd s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin 
restrictions 
a reinsurance to close ritc in general is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account 
if the syndicate s managing agency concludes that an appropriate ritc cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year  it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run off 
during this period there cannot be a release of the funds at lloyd s of a corporate member that is a member of that syndicate without the consent of lloyd s and such consent will only be considered where the member has surplus funds at lloyd s 
the financial security of the lloyd s market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies am best  s p and fitch 
a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for lloyd s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels 
rsml and renaissancere ccl would be adversely affected if lloyd s current ratings were downgraded 
intervention powers 
the council of lloyd s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members underwriting at lloyd s 
it may  for instance  change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the funds at lloyd s or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of funds at lloyd s 
exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member s participation in a given underwriting year 
if a member of lloyd s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders  such debts may be payable by the lloyd s central fund  which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the us if lloyd s determines that the central fund needs to be increased  it has the power to assess premium levies on current lloyd s members 
the council of lloyd s has discretion to call or assess up to of a member s underwriting capacity in any one year as a central fund contribution 
lloyd s approval is also required before any person can acquire control as defined below in relation to the fsma and giving prior notification to the fsa of a lloyd s managing agent or lloyd s corporate member 
fsa regulation rsml s operations are regulated by the fsa as well as being franchised by lloyd s of london 
the fsa has substantial powers of intervention in relation to the lloyd s managing agents  such as rsml  which it regulates  including the power to remove their authorization to manage lloyd s syndicates 
in addition  each year the fsa requires lloyd s to satisfy an annual solvency test which measures whether lloyd s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members  both current and run off 
if lloyd s fails this test  the fsa may require lloyd s to cease underwriting and or its members to cease or reduce underwriting 
lloyd s as a whole is authorized by the fsa and is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the fsa  pursuant to its powers under the lloyd s act relating to the operation of the lloyd s market 
lloyd s prescribes  in respect of its managing agents and corporate members  certain minimum standards relating to their management and control  solvency and various other requirements 
the fsa directly monitors lloyd s managing agents compliance with the systems and controls prescribed by lloyd s 
if it appears to the fsa that either lloyd s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance  the fsa may intervene at its discretion 
future regulatory 
table of contents changes or rulings by the fsa could impact rsml s business strategy or financial assumptions  possibly resulting in an adverse effect on rsml s financial condition and operating results 
change of control 
the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any lloyd s managing agent which is authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that  together with its or his associates  directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of renaissancere s common shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of rsml 
under the fsma  any person or entity proposing to acquire control over a lloyd s managing agent must give prior notification to the fsa of his or the entity s intention to do so 
the fsa would then have sixty working days to consider the application to acquire control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against rsml by the fsa 
lloyd s approval is also required before any person can acquire control using the same definition as for the fsa of a lloyd s managing agent or lloyd s corporate member 
other applicable laws 
lloyd s worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to various regulations  laws  treaties and other applicable policies of the european union  as well as each nation  state and locality in which it operates 
material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse affect on lloyd s and its member companies  including rsml and renaissancere ccl 
solvency ii solvency ii was adopted by the european parliament in april of implementation of solvency ii by the european commission is expected to take effect january  in the european union member states  and will replace the current solvency requirements 
solvency ii adopts a risk based approach to insurance regulation 
its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk  effect group supervision of insurance and reinsurance affiliates  implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for insurers across the european union member states  establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies  and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations 
under solvency ii  an insurer s or reinsurer s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the member state s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed by the european commission 
it is anticipated that insurers or reinsurers with approved internal models will generally have lower capital needs 
with respect to syndicate  implementation of solvency ii may require increases in capital and may negatively impact our financial results 
implementation of solvency ii will require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance 
we are monitoring the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps following adoption of solvency ii 
the principles  standards and requirements of solvency ii may also  directly or indirectly  impact the future supervision of additional operating subsidiaries of ours 
environmental and climate change matters our principal coverages and services relate to natural disasters and catastrophes  such as earthquakes or hurricanes 
we believe  and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates  that changes in climate conditions  primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels  are likely to increase the severity  and possibly the frequency  of natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we expect that trend will increase the risk of claims under our property and casualty lines of business  particularly with respect to properties located in coastal areas  among others 
while a substantial portion of our coverages accordingly may be adversely impacted by climate change  we have taken certain measures  to the extent permissible by law and prevailing market conditions  to mitigate against such losses by giving consideration to these risks in our underwriting decisions 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information such as the studies referred to above 
however  it is possible that  even after these assessments  we will have underestimated the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
to the extent broad environmental factors  exacerbated by climate change or otherwise  lead to increases in likely insured losses  particularly if those losses exceed expectations and the prior estimates of market participants  
table of contents regulators or other stakeholders  the markets and clients we serve may be disrupted and adversely impacted  and we may be adversely affected  directly or indirectly 
further  certain of our investments such as catastrophe linked securities and property catastrophe managed joint ventures related to hurricane coverage  could also be adversely impacted by climate change 
an increasing number of federal  state  local and foreign government requirements and international agreements apply to environmental and climate change  in particular by seeking to limit or penalize the discharge of materials such as greenhouse gas ghg into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
although our operations are characterized by a small number of professional office facilities  and we have not been directly  materially impacted by these changes to date  it is our policy to monitor and seek to ensure compliance with these requirements  as applicable 
we believe that  as a general matter  our policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to identify and manage environmental and climate related risks  particularly the risks of potential financial liability in connection with our reinsurance  insurance and trading businesses 
however  we believe that some risk of environmental damage is inherent in respect of any commercial operation  and may increase for us if our business continues to expand and diversify  including as a result of the possible expansion of the products and services offered by real  or by investments which we have made or may make through real or other subsidiaries 
for example  our weather and energy risk management operations and our customers of such services could be impacted by climate change and increased ghg regulation 
likewise  certain of our investments may also be adversely affected by climate change and increased governmental regulation of  or international agreements pertaining to  ghg emissions 
moreover  our evaluation may be flawed or may reflect inaccurate or incomplete information  and it is possible our exposure to climate change or other environmental risks is greater than we have currently estimated 
at this time  we do not believe that any existing or currently pending climate change legislation  regulation  or international treaty or accord known to us would be reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or on our results of operations  capital expenditures or financial position 
however  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies  could give rise to more severe exposure  more costly compliance requirements  or otherwise bring into question our current policies and practices 
in addition  it is possible that state insurance regulation could impact the ability of our customers  or of the company  to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses 
for example  if our customers or operations are unable to utilize actuarially sound  risk based pricing  to modify policy terms if necessary to reflect changes in the underlying risks  or to otherwise manage exposures appropriately to reflect the risk of increased loss from both large scale natural catastrophes and smaller scale weather events  our markets  customers  or our own financial results may all be adversely affected 
we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following risks related to our company our exposure to catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next 
our largest product based on total gross premiums written is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance products and insurance products that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados  hailstorms  drought and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of a large magnitude 
we expect claims from catastrophic events to cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year  moreover  catastrophic claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to write new business could also be affected 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property  particularly along coastal regions  and the effects of inflation may continue to increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we expect to have greater exposures in one or more specific geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would otherwise suggest 
accordingly  when and if catastrophes occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe net negative impacts from such events than our competitors 
in particular  the company has historically had a relatively large percentage of its coverage exposures concentrated in the state of florida 
through renaissance trading and real  we sell certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engage in certain weather  energy and commodity derivatives trading activities 
the trading markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities  weather and other natural phenomena 
we expect our results from these activities will be subject to volatility  both potentially as a result of the occurrence or non occurrence of the event or events which might trigger counterparty payments under these contracts  and as a result of the potential for variance in the reportable fair value of these contracts between periods as a result of a wide number of potential factors 
while our current portfolio of such derivative contracts is not material to our consolidated results taken as a whole  and is currently of comparably short duration  it is possible that our results from these activities will increase on an absolute or relative basis over time  and that the duration of the derivative contracts in this portfolio will lengthen in the future 
our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates  using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed  as loss trends and claims inflation impact future payments  or as current laws or interpretations thereof change 
our specialty reinsurance operations are expected to produce claims which at times can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property losses which  on the whole  tend to be reported 
table of contents comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time  although every catastrophic event is comprised of a unique set of circumstances 
actual net claims and claim expenses paid and reported may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid and reported will differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses are lower than our expectations  we would be required to decrease claims and claim expense reserves and this would increase our net income 
estimates of losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and our estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
as an example  our estimates of losses from catastrophic events  such as the australian flooding  the earthquakes  hurricanes gustav and ike  and the hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
due to the size and unusual complexity of the legal and claims issues relating to these events  particularly the australian flooding  the earthquakes and hurricanes katrina and ike  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations to us 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength may adversely impact our business  perhaps materially so 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance and certain of our other operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically  the rating agencies evaluate us and may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
these ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them 
in addition  from time to time one or more rating agencies have effected changes in their capital models and rating methodologies  which have generally served to increase the amounts of capital required to support the ratings  and it is possible that legislation arising as a result of the financial crisis that preceded the ongoing period of relative economic weakness may result in additional changes 
negative ratings actions in the future could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize the market opportunities we currently expect to participate in 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our customers to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 

table of contents our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose customers to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our customers 
for the current ratings of certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures  refer item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  ratings for additional information 
the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the stock purchase agreement with qbe could adversely affect our future business 
there are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the pending sale of substantially all of our us based insurance operations to qbe pursuant to the stock purchase agreement 
the occurrence of certain events  changes or any other circumstances could give rise to the termination of the stock purchase agreement and cause the sale not to be completed 
for instance  there is no assurance that the parties will receive the necessary state insurance regulatory approvals required to close the transaction 
if the parties fail to obtain such approvals or to meet other conditions necessary to complete the sale as set forth in the stock purchase agreement  we will not be able to close the transaction 
failure to complete the sale would prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits to our business 
our business could be adversely impacted by uncertainty related to the proposed sale of our us based insurance operations  whether or not the sale is completed 
whether or not the sale of our us based insurance operations is completed  the announcement and pendency of the sale could impact our business  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the success of the sale  including if we succeed in consummating the sale  while we are retaining the operations that have represented the predominant part of our historic net income  our resulting operations will have significantly reduced revenues  reduced assets and  to a degree  reduced risk diversification 
it is possible that rating agencies  clients  brokers  investors or other stakeholders will view these changes to be more adverse  or our ability to mitigate related risks less effective  than we have estimated  that the proposed sale disrupts our current business plans and operations  our management s attention being directed toward the completion of the sale and transaction related considerations and being diverted away from our day to day business operations and the execution of our current business plans  and incurring transaction costs  such as legal  financing and accounting fees  and other costs  fees  expenses and charges related to the sale  whether or not the sale is completed 
even if the sale is completed  achieving the anticipated benefits of the sale is subject to a number of uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that we will realize the full benefits of strategic focus  enhanced business flexibility  cost savings and operating efficiencies that we currently expect from this transaction or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and diversion of management s time and energy and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers in our reinsurance segment for a preponderance of our revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
our reinsurance business markets insurance and reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
three brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  subsidiaries and affiliates of aon benfield  marsh inc 
table of contents and the willis group accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written in the loss of a substantial portion of the business provided by our brokers would have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
the emergence of matters which may impact certain of our coverages  such as the asserted trend toward potentially significant global warming and the ongoing period of relative economic weakness  could cause us to underestimate our exposures and potentially adversely impact our financial results  perhaps significantly 
in our reinsurance business  we use analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
see item business  underwriting and enterprise risk management 
in general  our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are much better developed than those for other classes of risk in businesses that we have entered into more recently 
our models and databases may not accurately address the emergence of a variety of matters which might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages 
accordingly  our models may understate the exposures we are assuming and our financial results may be adversely impacted  perhaps significantly 
these risks may increase if we succeed in increasing the contributions from our specialty reinsurance unit or from our lloyd s segment  either on an absolute or relative basis 
we believe  and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates  that changes in climate conditions  primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels  are likely to increase the severity and possibly the frequency of natural catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we expect that this may increase claims under our property and casualty lines of business  particularly with respect to properties located in coastal and flood exposed areas  among others 
furthermore  certain energy and agriculture related products that we offer could also be negatively impacted by dramatically changing climactic conditions 
while we believe a substantial portion of our insureds may be adversely impacted by climate change  we have taken certain measures  to the extent permissible by law and prevailing market conditions  to mitigate against such losses by giving consideration to these risks in our underwriting decisions 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information such as these studies 
however  it is possible that  even after these assessments  we will have underestimated the scale of the risks  such as the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes or may have failed to identify new or increased risks 
to the extent broad environmental factors  exacerbated by climate change or otherwise  lead to increases in likely insured losses  particularly if those losses exceed expectations and the prior estimates of market participants  regulators or other stakeholders  the markets and clients we serve may be disrupted and adversely impacted  and we may be adversely affected  directly or indirectly 
further  certain of our investments such as insurance linked securities and property catastrophe managed joint ventures related to hurricane coverage could also be adversely impacted by climate change 
the ongoing relative weakness in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results 
although there have been some indicators of stabilization  the us and numerous other leading markets around the world continue to experience significant recessionary conditions  and we believe meaningful risk remains of potential further deterioration in economic conditions  including substantial and continuing financial market disruptions 
while many governments  including the us federal government  have taken substantial steps to stabilize economic conditions in an effort to increase liquidity and capital availability  if economic conditions deteriorate further  the business environment in our principal markets would be further adversely affected  which accordingly could adversely affect demand for the products sold by us or our customers 
economic conditions could also be adversely affected by an increase in global political instability  which might impact the price of energy products  agricultural goods and other commodities  or otherwise harm the markets in which we participate 
in addition  during an economic downturn we believe our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers and parties associated with our investment portfolio  among others  is likely to be increased 

table of contents some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that may experience significant market valuation fluctuations 
although we invest primarily in highly liquid securities in order to ensure our ability to pay valid claims in a prompt manner  we do hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative investments  which include private equity investments  bank loan fund investments and insurance linked securities 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
at times  the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments and  our high quality  generally more liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
a reduction in market liquidity may make it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading becomes less frequent 
as such  valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability and hinder our ability to pay claims promptly in accordance with our strategy 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our income from our invested assets  which are comprised of  among other things  fixed maturity securities  such as bonds  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities and investments in bank loan funds  hedge funds and private equity partnerships 
accordingly  our financial results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
our invested assets have grown over the years and have come to effect a comparably greater contribution to our financial results 
accordingly  a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
in the event of a significant or total loss in our investment portfolio  the company s ability to pay any claims promptly in accordance with our strategy could be adversely affected 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates and widening credit spreads 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 

table of contents a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other classes of investments which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
these other classes of investments include interests in alternative investment vehicles such as private equity partnerships  hedge funds  senior secured bank loan funds and catastrophe bonds and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
for the aforementioned classes of investments  the fair value of the assets comprising the portfolio of an investment vehicle  and likewise the net asset value of the investment vehicle itself  are generally established on the basis of the valuation criteria applied by the investment managers as set forth in the governing documents of such investment vehicles 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests  notes or other securities representing interests in the relevant investment vehicles 
interests in many of the investment classes described above are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these classes of investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
the performance of these classes of investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
in addition to the foregoing  we may from time to time re evaluate our investment approach and guidelines and explore investment opportunities in respect of other asset classes not previously discussed above  including  without limitation  by expanding our relatively small portfolio of direct investments in the equity markets 
any such investments could expose us to systemic and price volatility risk  interest rate risk and other market risks 
any investment in equity securities carries with it inherent volatility and there can be no assurance that such an investment will prove profitable and we could  in fact  lose the value of our investment 
accordingly  any such investment could impact our financial results  perhaps materially  over both the short and the long term 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk  including with respect to reinsurance brokers 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid by the cedants and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
we are also exposed to the credit risk of our customers  who  pursuant to their contracts with us  frequently pay us over time 
our premiums receivable at december  totaled million  and these amounts are generally not collateralized 
to the extent such customers become unable to pay future premiums  we would be required to recognize a downward adjustment to our premiums receivable in our financial statements 
we cannot assure you that all of such premiums will ever be collected or that additional amounts will not be required to be written down in or future periods 
as a result of the ongoing period of relative economic weakness  our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio and others has increased  perhaps materially so 

table of contents we are also exposed to counterparty credit risks in connection with our energy related trading business 
we undertake energy related trading activities through our operating subsidiaries  including renaissance trading and real  where counterparty credit risk becomes a relevant factor 
these operating subsidiaries execute weather  energy and commodity derivative transactions whereby the value of the derivatives at any point in time is dependent upon not only the market but also the viability of the counterparty 
the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss in these situations 
although these operating subsidiaries have credit risk management policies and procedures  we cannot assure you that any of the policies or procedures will be effective 
while many of the original trading positions established in our energy related trading business are partially or substantially hedged  the effectiveness of those hedges depends on the willingness and ability to pay of the parties with whom we establish the hedge positions 
the failure of our policies and procedures  or the failure of one or more of our counterparties  could result in losses that substantially exceed our expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
as part of our risk management  we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance when purchased to protect reinsurance companies is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining reinsurance 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
when we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account  the insolvency  inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we believe that the willingness to pay of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining  and that the overall industry ability to pay may be impacted by renewed weakness in the financial and credit markets 
this risk may be more significant to us at present than at many times in the past 
at december   we had recorded million of reinsurance recoverables  net of a valuation allowance of million for uncollectible recoverables 
we cannot assure you that such recoverables will ever be collected or that additional amounts will not be required to be written down in or future periods 
a large portion of our reinsurance recoverables are concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers 
the risk of such concentration of retrocessional coverage may be increased by recent and future consolidation within the industry 
emerging claim and coverage issues  or other litigation  could adversely affect us 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our specialty reinsurance operations  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some point in time after their occurrence 
for example  we could be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter  such as the potential for industry losses arising out of an avian flu pandemic  that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or not issue a ruling adverse to us 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
alternatively  potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could  if successful  reduce the market s acceptance of our related products 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class 
table of contents action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
while we continually seek to improve the effectiveness of our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
we may be adversely impacted by inflation 
we monitor the risk that the principal markets in which we operate could experience increased inflationary conditions  which would  among other things  cause loss costs to increase  and impact the performance of our investment portfolio 
the onset  duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision 
our utilization of third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each primary risk assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our customers may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume  perhaps materially so 
the loss of key senior members of management could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers 
the loss of services of members of senior management in the future  and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team  as applicable  may strain our ability to execute our strategic initiatives 
the loss of one or more of our senior officers could adversely impact our business  by  for example  making it more difficult to retain customers or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing officer 
in general  the loss of the services of any members of our current senior management team may adversely affect our business  perhaps materially so 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
in addition  our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent residents certificates and holders of working residents certificates may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a valid government work permit 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits  which would adversely impact us 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
a work permit is issued with an expiry date up to ten years and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or  if issued  renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term 
if any of our senior officers or key contributors were not permitted to remain in bermuda  or if we experience delays or failures to obtain permits for a number of our professional staff  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
us taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax  as a result of changes in law or regulations  or otherwise 
if the irs were to contend successfully that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the us  such subsidiary would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously contest such an assertion  if we were ultimately held to be subject to taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 
in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries in the us are only available to any of such subsidiaries if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
our bermuda subsidiaries may not be 
table of contents able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish it to the satisfaction of the irs 
finally  it is unclear whether the us bermuda income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
changes in us tax law or regulations could increase the costs of our products and services or otherwise reduce our profitability 
congress is reported to be considering legislation relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
in the immediately past congressional session  us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal 
hr the neal bill would have provided that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the obama administration included similar provisions in its formal and budgetary proposals 
in the event the sale of substantially all of our us based insurance operations does not close  we believe that passage of such legislation could adversely affect us  perhaps materially 
we could also be adversely impacted if final legislation actually enacted  if any  differs from the proposed language previously introduced or described 
in addition  in march  us senator carl levin and rep 
lloyd doggett introduced legislation in the us senate and house  respectively  entitled the stop tax haven abuse act s 

if enacted  this legislation would  among other things  cause to be treated as a us corporation for us tax purposes generally  entities whose shares are publicly traded on an established securities market  or whose gross assets are million or more  if the management and control of such a corporation is  directly or indirectly  treated as occurring primarily within the us the proposed legislation provides that a corporation will be so treated if substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of the corporation who exercise day to day responsibility for making decisions involving strategic  financial  and operational policies of the corporation are located primarily within the us in addition  among other things  the legislation would establish presumptions for entities and transactions in jurisdictions deemed to be offshore secrecy jurisdictions and would provide a list of such jurisdictions 
rep 
doggett introduced the international tax competitiveness act hr in may  and again in january hr  containing similar provisions 
to date  this legislation has not been approved by either the house of representatives or the senate 
however  we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not ultimately be adopted 
while we do not believe that the legislation would impact us  it is possible that an adopted bill would include additional or expanded provisions which could negatively impact us  or that the interpretation or enforcement of the current proposal  if enacted  would be more expansive or adverse than we currently estimate 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us  various states within the us and europe 
if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that the european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda based companies disproportionately 
any such development  or if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required  could significantly and negatively affect our operations 

table of contents glencoe is currently an eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurer in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and is subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these jurisdictions 
however  glencoe is not admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s activities in the us are limited  which could adversely affect its ability to compete 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements  and any such requirements may impact the operations of our insurance and or non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  or information technology failures 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls  information technology or application systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to risks in connection with our management of third party capital 
our operating subsidiaries may owe certain legal duties and obligations to third party investors including reporting obligations and are subject to a variety of often complex laws and regulations relating to the management of third party capital 
compliance with some of these laws and regulations requires significant management time and attention 
although we seek to continually monitor our policies and procedures to attempt to ensure compliance  faulty judgments  simple errors or mistakes  or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established policies and procedures  could result in our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations which could result in significant liabilities  penalties or other losses to the company  and seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing  our third party capital providers may redeem their interests in our joint ventures  which could materially impact the financial condition of such joint ventures  and could in turn materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we can provide no assurance that we may be able to attract and raise additional third party capital for our existing joint ventures or for potential new joint ventures and therefore we may forego existing and or potential attractive fee income and other income generating opportunities 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  as we expand geographically  an increasing portion of our premium is  and likely will be  written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves is also in non us dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the capital requirements of our business depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to sell our reinsurance and insurance products is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
while we do not currently expect to require additional external capital in the near term due to our strong current capital position  our operations are subject to the ever present potential for significant volatility in capital due to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic events 
any further equity or debt financing  or capacity needed for letters of credit  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position and operating results  market conditions  and applicable legal issues 
if we are unable to obtain adequate capital if and when needed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
in addition  in the future we may be unable to raise new capital for our managed joint ventures and other private alternative investment vehicles  which would reduce our future fee income and market capacity 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of million of indebtedness outstanding and million of outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  we have in place committed debt facilities which would permit us to borrow  subject to their respective terms and conditions  up to another million 
our indebtedness primarily consists of publicly traded notes and letter of credit and revolving credit facilities 
for more details on our indebtedness  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
bermuda law and various us insurance regulations may limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 

table of contents solvency ii could adversely impact our financial results and operations 
solvency ii  a european union directive concerning the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  which was adopted by the european parliament in april of  may adversely affect our re insurance businesses 
implementation of solvency ii by the european commission is expected to take effect january  in the european union member states  and will replace the current solvency requirements 
solvency ii adopts a risk based approach to insurance regulation 
its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk  effect group supervision of insurance and reinsurance affiliates  implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for insurers across the european union member states  establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies  and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations 
under solvency ii  an insurer s or reinsurer s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the member state s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed by the european commission 
it is anticipated that insurers or reinsurers with approved internal models will generally have lower capital needs 
with respect to syndicate  implementation of solvency ii may require increases in capital and may negatively impact our financial results 
implementation of solvency ii will require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance 
the european union is in the process of considering the solvency ii equivalence of bermuda s insurance regulatory and supervisory regime 
the european union equivalence assessment considers whether bermuda s regulatory regime provides a similar level of policyholder protection as provided under solvency ii 
a finding that bermuda s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent to the european union s solvency ii could have an adverse effect on our reinsurance operations in the european union and on our group solvency calculations 
such a finding could also have adverse indirect commercial impacts on our operations 
we are monitoring the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps following adoption of solvency ii 
the principles  standards and requirements of solvency ii may also  directly or indirectly  impact the future supervision of additional operating subsidiaries of ours 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act may adversely impact our business 
the us congress and the current administration have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues with respect to financial regulation reform  including regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  executive compensation and others 
one of those initiatives  the dodd frank act  was signed into law by president obama on july  the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states  establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the bcfp  and will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the dodd frank act or the resulting regulations will impact the company s business 
however  compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs  which may adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
although we do not expect these costs to be material to renaissancere as a whole  we cannot assure you this expectation will prove accurate or that the dodd frank act will not impact our business more adversely than we currently estimate 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make a strategic investment in new or other businesses that will not detract from our core reinsurance operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any failure by us to effectively limit such risks or implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our amended and restated bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
in addition  our byelaws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning  directly or indirectly  beneficially or otherwise  as described in our bye laws  more than of our common shares to not more than of the total voting power of our capital stock unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the board 
the primary purpose of these provisions is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  these provisions may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for  among other things a classified board  whose size is fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a vote  restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings  a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the board without further shareholder action  and a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 
in addition  similar provisions apply to our lloyd s managing agent  whereby the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any lloyd s managing agent which is authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that  together with its or his associates  directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process 

table of contents risks related to our industry the reinsurance and insurance businesses are historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline  which would affect our profitability 
the reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
following an increase in capital in our industry after the catastrophe events and the subsequent period of substantial dislocation in the financial markets which has resulted in ongoing relative economic weakness  the reinsurance and insurance markets have experienced a prolonged period of generally softening markets 
the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future 
if demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  our prospects for potential growth  due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting  may be adversely affected 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 
in recent years  hedge funds and investment banks have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
while this trend has slowed during the ongoing period of relative economic weakness  we generally expect increased competition from a wider range of entrants over time 
it is possible that such new or alternative capital could cause reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in  the state of florida enacted legislation to expand the fhcf s provision of below market rate reinsurance to up to billion per season the florida bill 
in may of  the florida legislature enacted bill no 
cs cs cs hb the bill  which will gradually phase out billion in optional reinsurance coverage under the fhcf over the next five years  reducing the coverage amount to approximately billion 
the bill similarly allows the state sponsored property insurer  citizens  to raise its rates up to starting in and every year thereafter  until such time that it has sufficient funds to pay its claims and expenses 
for  the approved rate increase for citizens was approximately 
this legislation also increased the rates charged by the fhcf for certain portions of its expanded coverage  and provided for incremental staged reductions in the amount of the expanded coverage layers 
this legislation may  however  take several years to have a significant effect on the private market  moreover its impact may not be sufficient to restore stability to the florida market in light of certain trends that are adversely impacting the stability of the local market participants  such as practices and findings relating to sinkhole claims  and the statutes of limitations on alleged windstorm claims from prior accident years 
the florida bill and other regulatory actions over this period may have contributed to instability in the florida primary insurance market  where many insurers reported substantial and continuing losses in and  each unusually low catastrophe years 
because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the florida bill and the weakened financial position of florida insurers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other reinsurance market participants 
in addition  it is possible that other regulatory or legislative changes in  or impacting  florida could affect our ability to sell certain of our products and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
for example  in the past  federal bills have been proposed in congress and  in prior congressional sessions  passed by the house of representatives which would  if enacted  create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks  including those we currently insure and reinsure in the private markets 
in  the coga was introduced in the senate to federally guarantee bond issuances by certain government entities  potentially including the fhcf  the texas windstorm insurance association  the california earthquake authority  and others 
similar legislation was introduced in the house of representatives 
if enacted  this legislation or legislation similar to these proposals in import would  we believe  likely contribute to growth of these state entities or to their inception or alteration in a manner adverse to us 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation would be vigorously opposed if introduced in  if enacted these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of citizens and of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
other political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem increasingly interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years including as specifically addressed in the dodd frank act  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia and state insurance regulators  regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to provide insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  such as the legislation enacted in florida in or the proposed federal legislation described above  expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for matters such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  or such as a pandemic flu outbreak  increasingly mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  establish a new federal insurance regulator  revise laws  regulations  or contracts under which we operate  disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another  or repeal or diminish the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act 
we are incorporated in bermuda and are therefore subject to changes in bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations  including imposition of tax liability or increased regulatory supervision 
table of contents or change in regulation 
in addition  we are subject to changes in the political environment in bermuda  which could make it difficult to operate in  or attract talent to  bermuda 
the bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including in the us and in various states within the us we are unable to predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the uk  may consider changes to its relationship with the uk in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda or the international reinsurance market focused there  either of which could adversely impact us commercially 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
historically  periods of increased capacity levels in our industry generally have led to increased competition  and decreased prices for our products 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace  allied world  alterra  arch  axis  endurance  everest re  flagstone  montpelier re  partner re  platinum  transatlantic  validus  white mountains and xl  as well as a growing number of private  unrated reinsurers offering predominately collateralized reinsurance 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as berkshire  chartis  hannover re  ironshore  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time  we expect our competitors to change as well 
for example  following hurricane katrina in august  a significant number of new reinsurance companies were formed in bermuda which have resulted in new competition  which may well continue in subsequent periods 
also  hedge funds and investment banks have shown an interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products  such as catastrophe bonds  other insurance linked securities and collateralized reinsurance investment funds 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the reinsurance market or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
consolidation in the re insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that several re insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
reinsurance intermediaries could also continue to consolidate  potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business and distribute our products 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business or our results of operation 

table of contents the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of jurisdictions perceived by the oecd to be tax havens or to offer preferential tax regimes 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rules may adversely impact financial results irrespective of business operations 
accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles  both prospectively and for prior periods and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
in particular  the sec committed to announce during its intentions with respect to the ongoing discussions regarding the potential to either converge or transition to an international set of accounting standards that would be applied to financial statements filed with the sec 
such changes  if ultimately adopted  could have a significant impact on our financial reporting  impacting key matters such as our loss reserving policies and premium and expense recognition 
for example  the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board are considering adopting respective accounting standards that would require all reinsurance and insurance contracts to be accounted for under a new measurement basis  which standards are considered to be more closely related to fair value than the current measurement basis 
we are currently evaluating how the above initiatives will impact us  including with respect to our loss reserving policy and the effect it might have on recognizing premium revenue and policy acquisition costs 
required modification of our existing principles  either with respect to these issues or other issues in the future  could have an impact on our results of operations  including changing the timing of the recognition of underwriting income  increasing the volatility of our reported earnings and changing our overall financial statement presentation and increasing our expenses in order to implement and comply with any new requirements 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  new york and connecticut  have from time to time scrutinized and investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
it is possible such scrutiny could expand to include us in the future  and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework  or our business 
as noted above  because we frequently assume the credit risk of the counterparties with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these counterparties is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to industry practices

overview renaissancere was established in bermuda in to write principally property catastrophe reinsurance and today is a leading global provider of reinsurance and insurance coverages and related services 
our aspiration is to be the world s best underwriter of high severity  low frequency risks 
through our operating subsidiaries  we seek to produce superior returns for our shareholders by being a trusted  long term partner to our customers  for assessing and managing risk  delivering responsive solutions  and keeping our promises 
we accomplish this by leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management  and by investing in our capabilities to serve our customers across the cycles that have historically characterized our markets 
overall  our strategy focuses on superior risk selection  customer relationships and capital management 
we provide value to our customers and joint venture partners in the form of financial security  innovative products  and responsive service 
we are known as a leader in paying valid reinsurance claims promptly 
we principally measure our financial success through long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends  which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our company s financial performance  and believe we have delivered superior performance in respect of this measure over time 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these events 
we are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover 
accordingly  we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year  based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures  advisory services  weather and energy risk management operations and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  corporate expenses which include certain executive  legal and consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs  including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire  which represents the interest of third parties with respect to the net income of davincire  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt and preference shares 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
the operating results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio below 
table of contents generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior fiscal years  divided by net premiums earned 
discontinued operations on november   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with qbe to sell substantially all of our us based insurance operations  including our us property and casualty business underwritten through managing general agents  our crop insurance business underwritten through agro national  our commercial property insurance operations and our claims operations 
the company has classified the assets and liabilities associated with this transaction as held for sale and its financial results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
consideration for the transaction is book value at december   for the aforementioned businesses  currently estimated to be million  payable in cash at closing and subject to adjustment for certain tax and other items 
the transaction is expected to close in early and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 
segments our reportable segments include reinsurance  lloyd s and insurance 
reinsurance our reinsurance segment has two main units property catastrophe reinsurance  written for our own account  and for davinci  is our traditional core business 
we believe we are one of the world s leading providers of this coverage  based on catastrophe gross premiums written 
this coverage protects against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and tsunamis  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  wind storms  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 
specialty reinsurance  written for our own account  and for davinci  covering certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk that we assume 
our portfolio includes various classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  financial  mortgage guarantee  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance that we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business 
we are seeking to expand our specialty reinsurance operations over time  although we cannot assure you that we will do so  particularly in light of current and forecasted market conditions 
lloyd s our lloyd s segment includes insurance and reinsurance business written for our own account through syndicate syndicate started writing certain lines of insurance and reinsurance business incepting on or after june  the syndicate was established to enhance our underwriting platform by providing access to lloyd s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses 
renaissancere ccl  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is the sole corporate member of syndicate the results of syndicate were not significant to our overall consolidated results of operations and financial position during  however  we expect its absolute and relative contributions to our consolidated results of operations to grow over time 

table of contents insurance our insurance segment includes the insurance policies previously written in connection with our bermuda based insurance operations which were not included in the stock purchase agreement with qbe 
our insurance segment is managed by the global chief underwriting officer 
the bermuda based insurance business is written by glencoe  a bermuda domiciled excess and surplus lines insurance company that is currently eligible to do business on an excess and surplus lines basis in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
although we are not actively underwriting new business in the insurance segment  we may from time to time evaluate potential new business opportunities for our insurance segment 
other our other category primarily includes the results of our share of strategic investments in certain markets we believe offer attractive risk adjusted returns or where we believe our investment adds value  such as our investments in the tower hill companies  essent group ltd 
and the angus fund  where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we partner with other market participants  our weather and energy risk management operations primarily through renaissance trading and real  our investment unit which manages and invests the funds generated by our consolidated operations and corporate expenses  capital services costs and noncontrolling interests 
new business from time to time we consider diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies 
this potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted  additional classes of risk exposed business  both directly for our own account and through possible new joint venture opportunities 
we also regularly evaluate potential strategic opportunities that we believe might utilize our skills  capabilities  proprietary technology and relationships to support possible expansion into further risk related coverages  services and products 
generally  we focus on underwriting or trading risks where reasonably sufficient data may be available  and where our analytical abilities may provide us a competitive advantage  in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in accordance with our approach in respect of our then current portfolio of risks 
we regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business  enhance or focus our strategies  expand our distribution or capabilities  or to seek other benefits 
in evaluating potential new ventures or investments  we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core operations 
while we regularly review potential strategic transactions and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would be successful or materially enhance our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that our ability to potentially attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources  and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit 
risk management we seek to develop and effectively utilize sophisticated computer models and other analytical tools to assess and manage the risks that we underwrite and attempt to optimize our portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks 
our policies  procedures  tools and resources to monitor and assess our operational risks companywide  as well as our global enterprise wide risk management practices  are overseen by our chief risk officer  who reports directly to our chief financial officer 
with respect to our reinsurance operations  since we have developed and continuously seek to improve our proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
we believe that rems  as updated from time to time  is a more robust underwriting and risk management system than is currently commercially available elsewhere in the reinsurance industry and offers us a significant competitive advantage 
rems was originally developed to analyze catastrophe risks  though we continuously seek ways to enhance the program in order to analyze other classes of risk 

table of contents summary of critical accounting estimates claims and claim expense reserves general description we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of ibnr 
the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance lloyd s insurance total at december  in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance insurance total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments that cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the year ended december   changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million million  million  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax benefit expense 

table of contents our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our consolidated financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the us in in  we recorded million  million and million of gross claims and claim expenses as a result of losses arising from the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and the australian flooding  respectively 
our estimates of losses from these events are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
the uncertainty of our estimates for these events is additionally impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available  the magnitude and relative infrequency of the events  the expected duration of the respective claims development period  inadequacies in the data provided thus far by industry participants and the potential for further reporting lags or insufficiencies particularly in respect of the earthquakes  and in the case of the australian flooding  significant uncertainty as to the form of the claims and legal issues including  but not limited to  the number  nature and fiscal periods of the loss events under the relevant terms of insurance contracts and reinsurance treaties 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  and the continuing uncertainty relating to the large storms of  especially hurricane katrina  and those of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our catastrophe and specialty units within our reinsurance segment 
following is a discussion of the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units 

table of contents reinsurance segment property catastrophe reinsurance within our catastrophe unit  we principally write property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts to insure insurance and reinsurance companies against natural and man made catastrophes 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer or reinsurer when its aggregate paid claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in the contract  up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
our coverages are offered on either a worldwide basis or are limited to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
we also enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
this coverage is generally in the form of excess of loss retrocessional contracts and may cover all perils and exposures on a worldwide basis or be limited in scope to selected geographic areas  perils and or exposures 
the exposures we assume from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant may alter their book of business after the retrocessional coverage has been bound 
we also offer dual trigger reinsurance contracts which require us to pay claims based on claims incurred by insurers and reinsurers in addition to the estimate of insured industry losses as reported by referenced statistical reporting agencies 
our property catastrophe reinsurance business is generally characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity 
initial reporting of paid and incurred claims in general  tends to be relatively prompt 
we consider this business short tail as compared to the reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims payment and reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary insurance companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes  earthquakes or terrorism  the geographic area involved  post event inflation which may cause the cost to repair damaged property to increase significantly from current estimates  or for property claims to remain open for a longer period of time  due to limitations on the supply of building materials  labor and other resources  complex policy coverage and other legal issues  and the quality of each client s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments regarding these factors are reflected in our claims reserve estimates 
reserving for most of our property catastrophe reinsurance business does not involve the use of traditional actuarial techniques 
rather  claims and claim expense reserves are estimated by management after a catastrophe occurs by completing an in depth analysis of the individual contracts which may potentially be impacted by the catastrophic event 
the in depth analysis generally involves estimating the size of insured industry losses from the catastrophic event  reviewing our portfolio of reinsurance contracts to identify those contracts which are exposed to the catastrophic event  reviewing information reported by customers and brokers  discussing the event with our customers and brokers  and estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs arising from the catastrophic event on a contract by contract basis and in aggregate for the event 
once an event has occurred  during the then current reporting period we record our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from the event 
our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves is then determined by deducting cumulative paid losses from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event and our estimate of ibnr is determined by deducting cumulative paid losses  case reserves and additional case reserves from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event 
once we receive a notice of loss or payment request under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process and pay such claims promptly 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports as part of our loss reserve estimation process 
we also review catastrophe bulletins published by various statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining the size of the industry loss  
table of contents although these reports may not be available for some time after an event 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants and brokers  we also use industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies in relation to a loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 
for smaller events including localized severe weather events such as windstorms  hail  ice  snow  flooding  freezing and tornadoes  which are not necessarily prominent  public occurrences  we initially place greater reliance on catastrophe bulletins published by statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining what events occurred during the reporting period than we do for large events 
this includes reviewing catastrophe bulletins published by property claim services for us catastrophes 
we set our initial estimates of reserves for claims and claim expenses for these smaller events based on a combination of our historical market share for these types of losses and the estimate of the total insured industry property losses as reported by statistical reporting agencies  although we generally make significant adjustments based on our current exposure to the geographic region involved as well as the size of the loss and the peril involved 
this approach supplements our approach for estimating losses for larger catastrophes  which as discussed above  includes discussions with brokers and ceding companies  reviewing individual contracts impacted by the event  and modeling the loss in our rems system 
approximately one year from the date of loss for these small events  we estimate ibnr for these events by using an actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is to use the paid bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method in estimating ibnr 
the paid bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method loss development factors are selected based on a review of our historical experience and these factors are reviewed at least annually 
there were no changes to the paid loss development factors over the last three years 
in general  our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves for our more recent reinsured catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater potential variability  and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  uncertainty due to complex legal and coverage issues that can arise out of large or complex catastrophic events such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our customers 
as our property catastrophe reinsurance claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as seen in the actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis table below  of our inception to date claims and claim expenses in our catastrophe unit were incurred in the  and accident years  due principally to the losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  jeanne  katrina  rita  wilma  gustav and ike 
due to the size and complexity of the losses in these accident years  there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate settlement costs associated with these accident years 
in  we reviewed our processes and methodology for estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from certain mature large us hurricanes 
during this process  we evaluated several actuarial methodologies including using paid loss development factors  reported loss development factors and ratios of ibnr to case reserves 
in this review  among other things  we looked at our historical claims experience on these mature large us hurricanes  the number of claims associated with these mature large us hurricanes and available industry claims information on the same or similar events 
we determined that the use of the reported loss development factor methodology for these mature large us hurricanes would provide us with the best estimate of ultimate losses in respect of these events 
currently  we believe this approach is only applicable for the and large hurricanes as we believe that i these events have a large enough number of reported claims to be statistically sound  ii these events have available industry reported claims information to supplement our own historical reported loss information  and iii a sufficient amount of time has passed from the date of loss that the use of an actuarial method could assist in estimating the ultimate costs 
we implemented this actuarial methodology in the fourth quarter of with respect to our and hurricane losses 
in the future  we expect to evaluate applying this methodology to other mature large us hurricanes as we deem appropriate 
in implementing this actuarial technique  we adjusted our ultimate losses at december  on 
table of contents the hurricanes from reported to reported and from reported to reported for the hurricanes 
the impact of these changes within our catastrophe unit was a decrease in ultimate losses on the hurricanes by million and by million for our hurricane losses 
the net positive impact to our financial results was million after considering offsetting changes in reinsurance recoveries  reinstatement premiums  profit commissions and redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 
at december   we estimate our reported losses are and reported for the and hurricanes  respectively 
within our property catastrophe reinsurance business  we seek to review our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
our quarterly review procedures include identifying events that have occurred up to the latest balance sheet date  determining our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs associated with those new events which have arisen during the reporting period  reviewing the ultimate expected cost to settle claims and administrative costs associated with those events which occurred during previous periods  and considering new estimation techniques  such as additional actuarial methods or other statistical techniques  that can assist us in developing a best estimate 
this process is judgmental in that it involves reviewing changes in paid and reported losses each period and adjusting our estimates of the ultimate expected losses for each event if there are developments that are different from our previous expectations 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the years ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our catastrophe unit increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax benefit expense 
the favorable development on prior year reserves in within the company s catastrophe unit of million was due to reductions of million to the estimated ultimate losses of mature  large  mainly international catastrophe events  combined with reductions in net ultimate losses associated with the buncefield oil depot loss of million  the hurricanes of million  the hurricanes of million  european windstorm klaus of million and the hurricanes of million  with the remainder due to a reduction in ultimate losses on a large number of relatively small catastrophes 
the favorable development within our catastrophe unit of million in was principally attributable to a reduction in ultimate net losses associated with the hurricanes of million  the hurricanes of million  the european windstorm kyrill of million  the california wildfires of million  the flooding in the uk of million and the hurricanes of million  due to better than expected reported claims activity  and with respect to the and hurricanes  the adoption of a new actuarial technique using reported loss development factors to estimate the ultimate losses for these events  as discussed in more detail above 
the remaining favorable development within our catastrophe unit was due to a reduction of ultimate net losses on a variety of smaller catastrophes such as hail storms  winter freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes which occurred during the through accident years 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the table below summarizes our initial assumptions and changes in those assumptions for claims and claim expense reserves within our catastrophe unit 
as discussed above  the key assumption in estimating reserves for our catastrophe unit is our estimate of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table shows our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time 
the initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred from catastrophic events occurring during a particular accident year  and as reported as of december of that year 
the re estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december   and  represent our revised estimates as reported as of those dates 
the cumulative favorable adverse development shows how our most recent estimates as reported at december  differ from our initial accident year estimates 
favorable development implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while adverse development implies that our current estimates are higher than our original estimates 
total reserves as of december  reflect the unpaid portion of our estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table is presented on a gross basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries 
it also does not consider the impact of loss related premium or redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 

table of contents actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis in thousands  except percentages accident year initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses re estimated claims and claim expenses as of december  cumulative favorable adverse development decrease increase from initial ultimate claims and claim expense reserves as of december  of claims and claim expenses unpaid as of december  as quantified in the table above  since the inception of the company in  while we have experienced adverse development from time to time  on a cumulative basis we have experienced million of net favorable development on the run off of our gross reserves within our catastrophe unit 
this represents of our initial estimated gross claims and claim expenses for accident years and prior of billion and is calculated based on our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves as of december   compared to our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses  as of the end of each accident year 
as described above  given the complexity in reserving for claims and claims expenses associated with catastrophe losses for property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts  we have experienced development  both favorable and unfavorable  in any given accident year in amounts that exceed our inception to date percentage of 
for example  our accident year developed favorably by million  which is better than our initial estimates of claims and claim expenses for the accident year as estimated as of december   while our accident year developed unfavorably by million  or negative 
on a net basis our cumulative favorable or unfavorable development is generally reduced by offsetting changes in our reinsurance recoverables  as well as changes to loss related premiums such as reinstatement premiums  and redeemable noncontrolling interest for changes in claims and claim expenses that impact davincire  all of which generally move in the opposite direction to changes in our ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the percentage of claims unpaid at december  for each accident year reflects both the speed at which claims and claim expenses for each accident year have been paid and our estimate of claims and claim expenses for that accident year 
as seen above  claims and claim expenses for the accident year have to date been paid quickly compared to prior accident years 
this is due to the fact that hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne which occurred in have been relatively rapid claims paying events 
this is driven in part by the mix of our business in florida  which primarily includes property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for personal lines property coverage  rather than commercial property coverage or retrocessional coverage  and the speed of the settlement and payment of claims by our underlying cedants 
in contrast  our accident year  which includes losses from the events of september   and our accident year  which includes significant losses from hurricane katrina  includes a higher mix of commercial business and retrocessional coverage where the underlying claims of our cedants tend to be settled and paid more slowly 
in addition  claims from our underlying cedants for the and accident years are subject to more complex coverage and legal matters due to the complexity of the catastrophic events taking place in those years 
sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to our estimates of ultimate losses for claims and claim expenses incurred from catastrophic events within our property catastrophe 
table of contents reinsurance business unit 
the reasonably likely changes are based on an historical analysis of the period to period variability of our ultimate costs to settle claims from catastrophic events  giving due consideration to changes in our reserving practices over time 
in general  our claim reserves for our more recent catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as a result  the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year  our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses for the catastrophic events occurring in each accident year  and the reasonably likely variability of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries  loss related premium or redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 
property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve sensitivity analysis in thousands  except percentages ultimate claims and claim expenses at december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses at december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses at december  impact of change on net income for the year ended december  impact of change on shareholders equity at december  higher recorded lower we believe the changes we made to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses represent reasonably likely outcomes based on our experience to date and our future expectations 
while we believe these are reasonably likely outcomes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes in our underlying assumptions 
it is possible that our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses could be significantly higher or lower than the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events for which we have not estimated claims and claim expenses or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our policies 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
specialty reinsurance within our specialty reinsurance business unit we write a number of reinsurance lines such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  property per risk  catastrophe exposed personal lines property and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance products  and we also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products to insurance companies and other reinsurance companies and provide coverage for specific geographic regions or on a worldwide basis 
we expanded our specialty reinsurance business in and have increased our presence in the specialty reinsurance market since that time 

table of contents our specialty reinsurance business can generally be characterized as providing coverage for low frequency and high severity losses  similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
as with our property catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance contracts frequently provide coverage for relatively large limits or exposures 
as a result of the foregoing  our specialty reinsurance business is subject to significant claims volatility 
in periods of low claims frequency or severity  our results will generally be favorably impacted while in periods of high claims frequency or severity our results will generally be negatively impacted 
our processes and methodologies in respect of loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance operation differ from those used for our property catastrophe oriented coverages 
for example  our specialty reinsurance coverages are more likely to be impacted by factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment  which we believe gives rise to greater uncertainty in our claims reserves 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in certain of these lines and may have little or no related corporate reserving history in new lines 
we believe this makes our specialty reinsurance reserving subject to greater uncertainty than our catastrophe unit 
when initially developing our reserving techniques for our specialty reinsurance coverages  we considered estimating reserves utilizing several actuarial techniques such as paid and reported loss development methods 
we elected to use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method because this method is appropriate for lines of business  such as our specialty reinsurance business  where there is a lack of historical claims experience 
this method allows for greater weight to be applied to expected results in periods where little or no actual experience is available  and  hence  is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of actual paid and or reported loss data 
this method uses initial expected loss ratio expectations to the extent that losses are not paid or reported  and it assumes that past experience is not fully representative of the future 
as the company s reserves for claims and claim expenses age  and actual claims experience becomes available  this method places less weight on expected experience and places more weight on actual experience 
we reevaluate our actuarial reserving techniques on a periodic basis 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an expected loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated expected claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
our estimate of ibnr is the product of the premium we have earned  the initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and the percentage of estimated unreported losses 
in addition  certain of our specialty reinsurance coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes 
we estimate claim reserves for these losses after the event giving rise to these losses occur  following a process that is similar to our catastrophe unit described above 
within our specialty reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
typically  our quarterly review procedures include reviewing paid and reported claims in the most recent reporting period  reviewing the development of paid and reported claims from prior periods  and reviewing our overall experience by underwriting year and in the aggregate 
we monitor our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting assumptions on a quarterly basis and compare them to our actual experience 
these actuarial assumptions are generally reviewed annually  based on input from our actuaries  underwriters  claims personnel and finance professionals  although adjustments may be made more frequently if needed 
assumption changes are made to adjust for changes in the pricing and terms of coverage we provide  changes in industry standards  as well as our actual experience  to the extent we have enough data to rely on our own experience 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the years ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our specialty reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax benefit expense 

table of contents the favorable development within the company s specialty unit in of million includes million associated with actuarial assumption changes made in  principally in the company s casualty clash and surety lines of business  and partially offset by an increase in reserves within the company s workers compensation per risk line of business  as a result of revised initial expected loss ratios and loss development factors due to actual experience coming in better than expected million due to a decrease in case reserves and additional case reserves  which are reserves established at the contract level for specific losses or large events  and the remainder due to reported losses coming in better than expected in on prior accident years events 
the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit of million in was principally attributable to lower than expected claims emergence on the through underwriting years of million which was driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for this business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves  as well as million due to a reduction on one claim on a contract related to the hurricanes  and partially offset by a million increase in our estimated ultimate net losses on the madoff matter 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the actual vs 
initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio table below summarizes our key actuarial assumptions in reserving for our specialty reinsurance business 
as noted above  the key actuarial assumptions include the estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the estimated loss reporting patterns 
the table shows our initial estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio by underwriting year 
the table shows how our initial estimates of these ratios have developed over time  with the re estimated ratios reflecting a combination of the amount and timing of paid and reported losses compared to our initial estimates

initial estimated specialty reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting year initial estimate re estimate at december  december  december  the table above shows our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios for attritional losses for each new underwriting year within our specialty reinsurance unit as of the end of each calendar year 
until  our initial estimated ultimate remained relatively constant between in and in and this reflects the fact that management had not made significant changes to its initial estimates of expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios from one underwriting year to the next 
the principal reason for the 
table of contents modest changes from one underwriting year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
for example  the mix of business for the through underwriting years have a lower initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio than in prior years as it is more heavily weighted to business that is expected to produce a lower level of losses 
the decrease in the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from and prior to through also reflects assumption changes made for certain classes of business where our experience  and the industry experience in general  has been better than expected and  as a result  we decreased our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for these classes of business 
the decrease in the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for  compared to  is principally due to a shift in the mix of business to lower expected loss ratio business  combined with shifts in our assumptions around modeled expected loss ratios and expected reporting patterns 
the estimated ultimate net claims and claim expense ratio at december  of  increased from the initial estimate of primarily as a result of several relatively large claims incurred in including those associated with the chilean earthquake  tropical cyclone tasha  the deepwater horizon oil rig event and the pacific gas and electric co 
explosion in san francisco  california 
as each underwriting year has developed  our re estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed 
in particular  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios decreased significantly from the initial estimates for the through underwriting years 
this was principally due to our reserve review 
during our reserve review  we further segmented the specialty business with the aim of grouping risks into more homogeneous categories which respond to the evolution of actual exposures 
this became possible as the volume of this business increased over the three preceding years 
this further segmentation required the selection of loss reporting patterns to be applied to these new groups 
we also updated our assumptions for our original loss reporting patterns based on a combination of new industry information and actual experience accumulated over the three preceding years 
the assumptions for the new loss reporting patterns were applied to all prior underwriting years 
in addition  we made explicit allowances for commuted contracts whereas previously these were considered in the overall reserving assumptions 
we also reviewed substantially all of our case reserves and additional case reserves 
the result of the foregoing was a decrease in our specialty reinsurance re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense reserves in subsequent to this reserve review  the results of our specialty book of business have been mixed 
the underwriting year includes favorable development as actual paid and reported losses during have overall been less than expected  which has resulted in a reduction in our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for this year 
however  the underwriting year has performed worse than expected and our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
this is due in part to the losses in our casualty clash line of business in  associated with exposure to the deterioration of the credit and capital markets in as well as the madoff matter discovered in the fourth quarter of as noted above  our specialty reinsurance business is in general characterized by events of low frequency and high severity which results in actual experience that can be significantly better or worse than long term trends or industry standards may imply 
as noted above  some of our specialty reinsurance contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the events which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above 
the large catastrophes occurring during the period from to impacting our specialty unit principally include hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in our estimate of ultimate net claims and claim expenses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  within our specialty reinsurance unit  net of reinsurance recoveries and assumed and ceded loss related premium  totaled million  million  million  million  million and million at december      and  respectively

the reasonably likely changes are based on a historical analysis of the period to period variability of our ultimate costs to settle claims from catastrophic events  giving due consideration to changes in our reserving practices over time 
in general  our claim reserves for our more recent catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as a result  the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year  our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses for the catastrophic events occurring in each accident year  and the reasonably likely variability of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year

reinsurance recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
the estimate of reinsurance recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  reinsurance recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
reinsurance recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured losses for the industry as a whole that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency  as per the contract terms 
in addition  the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on reinsurance recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverable to be recorded 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future 
the amounts recoverable ultimately collected are open to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims  for reasons including insolvency and elective run off  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
in addition  because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time  economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change  and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
to reflect these uncertainties  we estimate and record a valuation allowance for potential uncollectible reinsurance recoverable which reduces reinsurance recoverable and net earnings 
we estimate our valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each recovery based on our counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain recoveries that we deem unlikely to be collected in full 
we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the valuation allowance based on other qualitative and judgmental factors 
the valuation allowance recorded against reinsurance recoverable was million at december  million 
the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for  and  respectively  of our reinsurance recoverable balance at december   and  respectively 
the three largest company specific components of the valuation allowance represented  and  respectively  of our total valuation allowance at december   and  respectively 
fair value measurements and impairments fair value the use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our financial statements  and is a critical accounting policy and estimate for us 
fair value is defined under accounting guidance currently applicable to us to be the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date 
we recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our consolidated 
table of contents statements of operations  with the exception of changes in unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity investments available for sale  which are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures prescribes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the respective valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below fair values determined by level inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices obtained from active markets for identical assets or liabilities for which we have access to 
the fair value is determined by multiplying the quoted price by the quantity held by us  fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals  broker quotes and certain pricing indices  and level inputs are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in these cases  significant management assumptions can be used to establish management s best estimate of the assumptions used by other market participants in determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and we considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
in order to determine if a market is active or inactive for a security  we consider a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the spread between what a seller is asking for a security and what a buyer is bidding for the same security  the volume of trading activity for the security in question  the price of the security compared to its par value for fixed maturity investments  and other factors that may be indicative of market activity 
there have been no material changes in our valuation techniques in the period represented by these consolidated financial statements 
see note fair value measurements in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about fair value measurements 

table of contents below is a summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and also represents the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet december  total quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level in thousands assets fixed maturity investments short term investments other investments other secured assets other assets and liabilities percentage of total fair value assets and liabilities other assets of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
other liabilities of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
as at december   we classified million and million of assets and liabilities  respectively  at fair value on a recurring basis using level inputs 
this represented and of our total assets and liabilities  respectively 
level fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable 
these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
we use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms  market prices and rates  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs  some of which may be unobservable  to value these level assets and liabilities 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment 
in making the assessment  we considered factors specific to the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability 
impairments the amount and timing of asset impairment is subject to significant estimation techniques and asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate for us 
the more significant impairment reviews we complete are for our fixed maturity investments available for sale  equity method investments and goodwill and other intangible assets as described in more detail below 
fixed maturity investments available for sale pursuant to authoritative gaap guidance effective april   our quarterly process for assessing whether declines in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale represent impairments that are other than temporary includes reviewing each fixed maturity investment available for sale that is impaired and determining i if we have the intent to sell the debt security or ii if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and iii whether a credit loss exists  that is  where we expect that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security are less than the amortized cost basis of the security 

table of contents in assessing our intent to sell securities  our procedures may include actions such as discussing planned sales with our third party investment managers  reviewing sales that have occurred shortly after the balance sheet date  and consideration of other qualitative factors that may be indicative of our intent to sell or hold the relevant securities 
the company recognized a total of nil of other than temporary impairments due to our intent to sell these securities during the year ended december  million 
in assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before its anticipated recovery  we consider various factors including our future cash flow forecasts and requirements  legal and regulatory requirements  the level of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity investments trading and fixed maturity investments available for sale in an unrealized gain position  and other relevant factors 
for the year ended december   we recognized nil of other than temporary impairments due to required sales nil 
in evaluating credit losses  we consider a variety of factors in the assessment of a security including i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost and par  iii the potential for the security to recover in value  iv an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer  v the rating of the issuer  vi the implied rating of the issuer based on an analysis of option adjusted spreads  vii the absolute level of the option adjusted spread for the issuer  and viii an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
once we determine that it is possible that a credit loss may exist for a security  we perform a detailed review of the cash flows expected to be collected from the issuer 
we estimate expected cash flows by applying estimated default probabilities and recovery rates to the contractual cash flows of the issuer  with such default and recovery rates reflecting long term historical averages adjusted to reflect current credit  economic and market conditions  giving due consideration to collateral and credit support  if applicable  and discounting the expected cash flows at the purchase yield on the security 
in instances in which a determination is made that an impairment exists but we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis  the impairment is separated into i the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss  and ii the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recognized million and thousand of credit related other than temporary impairments which were recognized in earnings and other than temporary impairments related to other factors which were recognized in other comprehensive income  respectively million and million  respectively 
at december   our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of  we started designating  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale and  as a result  we recognized million of net unrealized gains on these securities in our consolidated statements of operations in net unrealized losses of million 
we currently expect to continue to designate  in future periods  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale  and  as a result  we currently expect our fixed maturity investments available for sale balance to decrease and our fixed maturity trading balance to increase over time  resulting in a reduction in other than temporary accounting judgments we make 
this change will over time result in additional volatility in our net income loss in future periods as net unrealized gains and losses on these fixed maturity investments will be recorded currently in net income loss  rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
investments in other ventures  under equity method investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures  under equity method  and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under this method  we record our proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in our results for the period 
any decline in the value of investments in other ventures  under equity method  including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee  considered by management to be other than temporary  is impaired and is reflected in our consolidated statements of 
table of contents operations in the period in which it is determined 
as of december   we had million million in investments in other ventures  under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets  including million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets million and million 
in determining whether an equity method investment is impaired  we look at a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee  the investee s future business plans and projections  recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available  discussions with the investees management  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change  this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken 
during the year ended december   we recorded million nil  million in other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in other ventures  under the equity method 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value 
subsequent to initial recognition  finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life  subject to impairment  and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
if goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired  they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for purposes of the annual impairment evaluation  goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets and is tested based on the cash flows they produce 
there are generally many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation 
principally  we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to  and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis  including market conditions 
other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and related charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
an impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable 
as at december   excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures  under equity method  as noted above  our consolidated balance sheets include million of goodwill million and million of other intangible assets million 
as part of the annual impairment evaluation noted above  no reporting units were identified to be at risk of failing step one of the process for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
impairment charges were nil during nil  nil 
premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
we generally recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is usually the date we are on risk for the policy 
the date we are on risk is generally either the effective date of the contract if the slip is signed prior to the effective date of the contract or the date the reinsurance slip is signed if that occurs after the effective date of the contract 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 

table of contents we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are either estimated or earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are used to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
in recent periods  the complexity of estimating reinsurance premiums has been impacted by the financial difficulties being experienced in certain of our target markets  which has contributed to circumstances in which primary insurers have been unable to make  or have sought to defer  premium payments due to us 
we cannot assure you that our estimates of the collectability of premiums are accurate or that these trends will not be accelerated in future periods 
reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a significant loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross premiums written  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned 
in our insurance business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our insurance segment at december  were million million  million  and total estimated premiums earned were nil million  million 
total earned commissions estimated at december  were million million  million 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date  such subsequent adjustments have not been material

ceded premiums written year ended december  in thousands ceded premiums written reinsurance segment due to the potential volatility of the property catastrophe reinsurance contracts which we sell  we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
we use our rems modeling system to evaluate how each purchase interacts with our portfolio of reinsurance contracts we write  and with the other ceded reinsurance contracts we purchase  to determine the appropriateness of the pricing of each contract and whether or not it helps us to balance our portfolio of risks 

table of contents ceded premiums written decreased by million in  compared to  principally due to the non renewal of tim re ii  which the company ceded million of assumed catastrophe premiums in  combined with the company s decision to reduce its reinsurance protection given the insufficiently priced coverage being available during ceded premiums written increased by million in  compared to  principally due to the company electing to purchase additional reinsurance protection due to appropriately priced coverage being available during  combined with the utilization in the us hurricane season of a fully collateralized joint venture  tim re ii  pursuant to which million of assumed catastrophe reinsurance premium was fully ceded in to the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available  we anticipate continued use of reinsurance to reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk  however  the buying of ceded reinsurance in our reinsurance segment is based on market opportunities and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for insurance linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverages attractive

our prior year reserves experienced million  million and million of net favorable development in  and  respectively 
the favorable development on prior year reserves in included million related to our catastrophe reinsurance unit and million related to our specialty reinsurance unit 
the favorable development within the catastrophe reinsurance unit was due to reductions of million to the estimated ultimate losses of mature  large  mainly international catastrophe events  combined with reductions in net ultimate losses associated with the buncefield oil depot loss of million  the hurricanes of million  the hurricanes of million  european windstorm klaus of million and the hurricanes of million  with the remainder due to a reduction in ultimate losses on a large number of relatively small catastrophes 
the favorable development within the specialty unit includes million associated with actuarial assumption changes made in the first quarter of  principally in the casualty clash and surety lines of business  and partially offset by an increase in reserves within the workers compensation per risk line of business  principally as a result of revised initial expected loss ratios and loss development factors due to actual experience coming in better than expected  million due to a decrease in case reserves and additional case reserves  which are reserves established at the contract level for specific losses or large events  and reported losses developing more favorably than expected in on prior accident years events 

table of contents the favorable development in was the result of reductions in estimated ultimate losses on certain specific events within the catastrophe unit  and lower than expected claims emergence within our specialty unit  as discussed in more detail below

our reinsurance segment generated million of underwriting income and reported a combined ratio of in  compared to million of underwriting income and a combined ratio of in  an increase of million in underwriting income and a percentage point decrease in the combined ratio

during periods with low levels of property catastrophe loss activity  such as  we have the potential to produce a low level of losses and a related increase in underwriting income 
as described above  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of the costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally move in line with the fluctuation in gross premiums earned 
our acquisition expense ratio was in both and in  the acquisition expense ratio of was slightly lower than the recorded in  primarily as a result of higher profit commissions on ceded premiums earned during operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and other general and administrative expenses 
for  operating expenses decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in  primarily due to a change in our internal allocation of certain expenses 
for  our operating expenses increased million  or  to million  compared to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in our employee base and our strong financial results in which increased performance related compensation costs  as well as the impact of the larger employee base on technology  occupancy  consulting and related general and administrative expenses 
our operating expense ratio may increase over time  as a result of factors including the absolute and comparative growth of our operating expenses  further refinements to internal expense allocations  and market trends and dynamics 

table of contents we have entered into joint ventures and specialized quota share cessions of our book of business 
in accordance with the joint venture and quota share agreements  we are entitled to certain profit commissions and fee income

our specialty reinsurance unit experienced million of net favorable development in and includes million associated with actuarial assumption changes made in the first quarter of  principally in the casualty clash and surety lines of business  and partially offset by an increase in reserves within the workers compensation per risk line of business  principally as a result of revised initial expected loss ratios and loss development factors due to actual experience coming in better than expected  million due to a decrease in case reserves and additional case reserves  which are reserves established at the contract level for specific losses or large events  and reported losses coming in better than expected in on prior accident years events 
our specialty reinsurance unit experienced favorable development on prior year reserves of million and million in and  respectively 
the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit of million in was principally attributable to lower than expected claims emergence on the through underwriting years of million which was driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for this business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves  as well as million due to a reduction on one claim on a contract related to the hurricanes  and partially offset by a million increase in our estimated ultimate net losses on the madoff matter 
the favorable development on prior year reserves in was due to reported claim activity being less than expected

insurance segment gross premiums written gross premiums written in our insurance segment decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to the non renewal of the majority of the remaining in force book of business 
gross premiums written in the insurance segment can fluctuate significantly between quarters and between years based on several factors  including  without limitation  the timing of the inception or cessation of quota share reinsurance contracts  including whether or not the company has portfolio transfers in  or portfolio transfers out  of quota share reinsurance contracts of in force books of business 
although the company is not actively underwriting new business in the insurance segment  from time to time  it will evaluate potential new business opportunities for its insurance segment 
gross premiums written in our insurance segment decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to our decision in late to terminate several program manager relationships and a commercial property quota share contract as a result of the then softening market conditions and in the second quarter of  to reduce our participation on a personal lines property quota share contract

the decrease in net premiums earned and underwriting expenses is due to the decrease in gross premiums written  noted above  combined with ceded premiums written being fully earned during the year as a result of the non renewal of the previously in force book of business  noted above

our hedge funds  private equity and other investments are accounted for at fair value with the change in fair value recorded in net investment income which included net unrealized gains of million in  compared to million of net unrealized losses in our net investment income for benefitted from the tightening of credit spreads  which resulted in increases in the fair value of many of our investments 
declining interest rates and lower spreads in have lowered the yields at which we invest our assets relative to historical levels 
we expect these developments  combined with the current composition of our investment portfolio and other factors  to put downward pressure on our net investment income for the near term

a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates rise  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  we started designating  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale and  as a result  we recognized million of net unrealized gains on these securities in our consolidated statement of operations for we currently expect to continue to designate  in future periods  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale  and  as a result  we currently expect our fixed maturity investments available for sale balance to decrease and our fixed maturity trading balance to increase over time  resulting in a reduction in other than temporary accounting judgments we make 
this change will over time result in additional volatility in our net income loss in future periods as net unrealized gains and losses on these fixed maturity investments will be recorded in net income loss  rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
net realized gains on fixed maturity investments were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  as a result of a million decrease in gross realized losses and a million decrease in gross realized gains

table of contents net other than temporary impairments were million in  compared to million in for the year ended december  and for the first three months of  we recognized other than temporary impairments if we could not assert that we had the ability and intent to hold our securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in accordance with authoritative literature 
if the impairment was determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss was recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for the year ended december  and for the first three months of  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million  and million  respectively 
for the nine months ended december   under updated guidance for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments which we adopted in the second quarter of  we recorded million of total other than temporary impairments of which million was recognized in earnings and includes million for credit losses and million for investments we intend to sell  with the remaining million related to other factors recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income

we no longer have an ownership interest in channelre and have no contractual obligations to provide capital or other financial support to channelre 
other income attributable to our weather and energy risk management operations of million in  decreased million  from other income of million in  due to a combination of less favorable net positions in respect of certain weather outcomes  lower business volume and less liquidity in the markets in which we operate 
our assumed and ceded reinsurance contracts accounted for as derivatives and deposits generated million in other income in  compared to an other loss of million in  an improvement of million  primarily due to less ceded reinsurance contracts that were accounted for at fair value in  compared to in  we generated million of other income compared to million in the million decrease in other income was primarily due to a million increase in other loss related to our assumed and ceded reinsurance contracts accounted for as derivatives and deposits  principally due to the inception of several new ceded contracts during the second quarter of  for which the losses principally relate to the expiration of the contractual premium over the risk period and for which no recoveries have been estimated  and partially offset by a million increase in other income from our weather and energy risk management operations from million in to million in certain contracts we enter into and our weather and energy risk operations are based in part on proprietary weather forecasts provided by our weather predict subsidiary 
the weather and energy risk operations in which we engage are both seasonal and volatile  and there is no assurance that our performance to date will be indicative of future periods 
during  we have allocated an increased amount of capital to our weather and energy risk management operations  and have offered certain new financial products within this group 
although there can be no assurances  it is possible that our results from these activities will increase on an absolute or relative basis over time 
we have expanded our weather and energy risk management operations in the last several years to include weather contingent energy products and by increasing the size and volume of transactions with respect to our previously existing weather and energy risk management operations 
the weather and energy risk management operations results include net realized and unrealized gains and losses on agreements with end users and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging and trading activities 
we are currently in the process of enhancing our weather and energy risk management infrastructure and operations to expand our participation in physical delivery and settlement of various of our energy products with our customers 
these activities present certain operational as well as financial risks  which we seek to mitigate

on december   we redeemed all of our series b preference shares for million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends to december   see capital resources section below for additional detail 
during  our interest expense decreased by million to million  compared to million in  primarily as a result of the repayment at maturity of our senior notes  which came due on july   and the decrease in interest expense associated with davincire s revolving credit facility due to a reduction in the average interest rates on the facility to approximately during  from during offsetting this decrease was an increase in interest expense on our revolving credit facility under which million was outstanding from july  until november   at which time we repaid the balance 
the average interest rate on this borrowing from january  through november  was  lower than the coupon rate on the senior notes repaid at maturity in july with the proceeds from our revolving credit facility drawdown at that time 
income tax benefit expense year ended december  in thousands income tax benefit expense we are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
during and  we generated an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively  which was principally the result of our us operations incurring pretax losses  compared to an income tax expense of million in  which was principally the result of our us operations generating pretax income 

table of contents for the years through  we generated cumulative gaap taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries 
during  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate gaap taxable income in our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover all of our us net deferred tax asset 
as a result  our valuation allowance was reduced by million in  and there was a corresponding decrease to income tax expense and increase to our net income 
our valuation allowance totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
the remaining valuation allowance as of december  relates exclusively to our operations in ireland and the uk our ireland and uk operations have produced gaap taxable losses and we currently do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate gaap taxable income from our subsidiaries in these operations and therefore do not believe that we will be able to recover our net deferred tax assets from these operations 
we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future  as our global operations outside of bermuda expand 
in addition  it is possible that we could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  regulation  or enforcement  any of which could increase our effective tax rate more rapidly or steeply than we currently anticipate 
net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire the net income attributed to the redeemable noncontrolling interest holders decreased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the decreased profitability of davincire 
the change in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest was driven by davincire generating lower underwriting income in  compared to  principally due to the earthquakes and also due to an increase in our ownership of davincire to in  compared to in  as noted above 
in january  davincire redeemed the shares of certain third party davincire shareholders 
as a result of this transaction  our ownership interest in davincire has increased to effective january  we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to make dividend payments to our preference and renaissancere common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under statutory regulations and insurance law  which require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
in addition  bermuda regulations require approval from the bma for any reduction of capital in excess of of statutory capital  as defined in the insurance act 
the insurance act also requires these bermuda insurance subsidiaries of the company to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda insurance subsidiaries was billion billion and the minimum amount required to be maintained under bermuda law  the minimum solvency margin  was million million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davincire and the operating subsidiaries of renre insurance holdings ltd 
renre insurance returned capital to our holding company  which included dividends declared and return of capital  net of capital contributions received  of million  nil and million  respectively million  nil and million  respectively 
under the insurance act  renaissance reinsurance and davinci are classified as class insurers  and therefore must maintain capital at a level equal to its ecr which is established by reference to the bscr model 
the bscr is a standard mathematical model designed to give the bma more advanced methods for determining an insurer s capital adequacy 
underlying the bscr is the belief that all insurers should operate on an ongoing basis with a view to maintaining their capital at a prudent level in excess of the minimum solvency margin otherwise prescribed under the insurance act 
alternatively  under the insurance act  insurers may  subject to the terms of the insurance act and to the bma s oversight  elect to utilize an approved internal capital model to determine regulatory capital 
in either case  the ecr shall at all times equal or exceed the class insurer s minimum solvency margin and may be adjusted in circumstances where the bma concludes that the insurer s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ecr or the insurer s assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ecr applicable to it 
while not specifically referred to in the insurance act  the bma has also established a tcl for each class insurer equal to of its ecr 
while a class insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level  the tcl serves as an early warning tool for the bma and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the tcl will likely result in increased bma regulatory oversight 
the company is currently completing the bscr for renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and at this time believes both companies will exceed the target level of required capital 
renaissancere ccl and syndicate are subject to regulation by the council of lloyd s 
syndicate is also subject to regulation by the fsa under the financial services and markets act underwriting capacity of a member of lloyd s must be supported by providing a deposit in the form of cash  securities or letters of credit  which are referred to as funds at lloyd s  in an amount determined by lloyd s in relation to the member s underwriting capacity 
this amount is determined by lloyd s through application of a risk based capital formula 
at december   the company maintained million and million as a funds at lloyd s facility million and million 
in addition  the fsa requires lloyd s syndicates to satisfy an annual solvency test and to maintain solvency on a continuous basis  which syndicate was in compliance with at december  in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
see capital resources section below 

table of contents cash flows and liquidity during  our cash and cash equivalents increased million  to million at december   compared to million at december   which excludes a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents related to discontinued operations held for sale 
the following discussion of our cash flows includes the results of operations and financial position of our discontinued operations held for sale at december   related to the sale of substantially all of our us based insurance operations 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  which consisted of  among other items  our net income of million  partially offset by a decrease in claims and claim expenses  net of million  net realized and unrealized investment gains on fixed maturity investments of million and unrealized gains included in net investment income of million related to our other investments 
as discussed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  summary of results of operations for  and  we generated strong underwriting and investment results  which contributed to cash flows provided by operating activities 
in addition  as noted above  claims and claim expenses  net decreased million in  compared to  primarily as a result of million of paid claims and claim expenses during  partially offset by incurred claims and claim expenses of million 
our cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to support our financing activities as discussed below 
cash flows provided by investing activities 
during  our cash flows provided by investing activities were million  which principally reflects our decision to decrease our allocation to other investments  specifically hedge funds  resulting in net sales of other investments of million 
our cash flows provided by investing activities were primarily used to support our financing and repurchase activities as discussed below 
cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flows used in financing activities in were million  primarily as a result of the repurchase of million of our common shares  the redemption of million of our series b preference shares as discussed below  the payment of million and million in dividends to our common and preferred shareholders  respectively  the repurchase of million of davincire shares of third party shareholders  and partially offset by the issuance of million of senior notes for million 
we have generated cash flows from operations for the three year period between and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
however  because a large portion of the coverages we provide can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
due to the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of the earthquakes  and hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary from preliminary estimates  perhaps materially 
as a result  our cash flows from operations would be impacted accordingly 
reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance lloyd s insurance total at december  in thousands catastrophe specialty total reinsurance insurance total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the year ended december   changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million million  million excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax benefit expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our consolidated financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 

table of contents we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the us in in  we recorded million  million and million of gross claims and claim expenses as a result of losses arising from the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and the australian flooding  respectively 
our estimates of losses from these events are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
the uncertainty of our estimates for these events is additionally impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available  the magnitude and relative infrequency of the events  the expected duration of the respective claims development period  inadequacies in the data provided thus far by industry participants and the potential for further reporting lags or insufficiencies particularly in respect of the earthquakes  and in the case of the australian flooding  significant uncertainty as to the form of the claims and legal issues including  but not limited to  the number  nature and fiscal periods of the loss events under the relevant terms of insurance contracts and reinsurance treaties 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  and the continuing uncertainty relating to the large storms of  especially hurricane katrina  and those of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance units within our reinsurance segment and within our lloyd s segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

lloyd s overall market rating am best  s p and fitch have each assigned an fsr to the lloyd s overall market 
the financial risks to policy holders of syndicates within the lloyd s market are partially mutualized through the lloyd s central fund  to which all underwriting members contribute 
because of the presence of the lloyd s central fund  and the current legal and regulatory structure of the lloyd s market  fsrs on individual syndicates are not appropriate 
this reflects the fact that syndicates are groupings of one or more capital providers  managed on their behalf by a managing agent  and are not legal entities in themselves 
while the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures within our reinsurance segment remain among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
in addition  it is common for our reinsurance contracts to 
table of contents contain provisions permitting our customers to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them

at december   we held investments totaling billion  compared to billion at december   with net unrealized appreciation included in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december   compared to million at december  our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital  market liquidity  and diversification of risk 
notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
because the reinsurance coverages we sell include substantial protection for damages resulting from natural and man made catastrophes  we expect from time to time to become liable for substantial claim payments on short notice 
accordingly  our investment portfolio as a whole is structured to seek to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio consists of highly rated fixed income securities  including us treasuries  agencies  highly rated sovereign and supranational securities  high grade corporate securities  federal deposit insurance corporation fdic guaranteed corporate securities and

as of december   we had  million of short term investments million 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at fair value 
during  we increased our allocation to short term investments by million  and decreased our allocation to other investments by million 
our target benchmark portfolio for our fixed maturity investments and short term investments currently has a year duration 
our duration at december  was years years 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will likely be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are also subject to default risk 
this risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the market value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us 
similar risks apply to other asset backed securities in which we may invest from time to time 
our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads even if specific securities are not downgraded 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads 
within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in 
table of contents foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective and also to widening of credit spreads

realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of the first in first out cost method and include adjustments to the cost basis of investments for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
pursuant to authoritative guidance effective april   we revised our quarterly process for assessing whether declines in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale represent impairments that are other than temporary 
the process now includes reviewing each fixed maturity investment available for sale that is impaired and determining i if we have the intent to sell the debt security or ii if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and iii whether a credit loss exists  that is  where we expect that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security are less than the amortized cost basis of the security

these net asset valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
in addition  due to a lag in reporting  some of our fund managers  fund administrators  or both  are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date 
in these circumstances  we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month s or quarter s fund valuation  adjusting these valuations for capital calls  redemptions or distributions and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and then estimating the return for the current period 
in circumstances in which we estimate the return for the current period  we use all credible information available to us 
this principally includes preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers  obtaining the valuation of underlying portfolio investments where such underlying investments are publicly traded and therefore have a readily observable price  using information that is available to us with respect to the underlying investments  reviewing various indices for similar investments or asset classes  as well as estimating returns based on the results of similar types of investments for which we have reported results  or other valuation methods  as necessary 
actual final fund valuations may differ  perhaps materially so  from our estimates and these differences are recorded in the period they become known as a change in estimate 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications

the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments 
we generally have no right to redeem our interest in any of these private equity partnerships in advance of dissolution of the applicable partnership 
instead  the nature of these investments is that distributions are received by us in connection with the liquidation of the underlying assets of the applicable limited partnership 
if these investments were held  it is estimated that the majority of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships would liquidate over to years from inception of the limited partnership 
senior secured bank loan funds our investment in senior secured bank loan funds includes funds that invest primarily in bank loans and other senior debt instruments 
the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the funds 
investments of million are redeemable  in whole or in part  on a monthly basis 
previously  we generally had no right to redeem our investment in certain bank loan funds in advance of dissolution of the applicable funds 
instead  the nature of this investment was that distributions were received by us in connection with the liquidation of the underlying assets of the applicable fund 
however  during  the management of the senior secured bank loan funds which previously could generally not be redeemed restructured these investments to a fund structure which would liquidate in the near term  and we elected to transfer our investment to the new fund structure 
subsequently  the balance of our investment in the new structure has been liquated and we have received million in distributions from the new fund structure 
we also have a million investment in a closed end fund which invests in loans 
we have no unilateral right to redeem our investment in this fund 
non us fixed income funds our non us fixed income funds invest primarily in european high yield bonds and non us convertible securities 
the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments 
investments of million are redeemable  in whole or in part  on a bi monthly basis 
the remaining million can generally only be redeemed by us at a rate of per month 
the issuers of these securities may permit redemptions which exceed this amount  but they are not obliged to do so 
hedge funds we invest in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies 
the strategies employed include  among others  the following fundamentally driven long short  event oriented  and private investments 
the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments 
included in our hedge funds is million of so called side pocket investments which are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder 
as to each investment in a hedge fund that includes side pocket investments  if the investment is otherwise fully redeemed  we will still retain our interest in the side pocket investments until the underlying investments attributable to such side pockets are liquidated  realized or deemed realized at the discretion of the fund manager

rihl rihl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  holds investment grade fixed maturity securities and short term investments and was formed to enhance administrative efficiency and take advantage of the increased benefits and reduced costs ordinarily associated with the management of large investment portfolios of different subsidiaries in the same group 
in addition  the administrative efficiency afforded by the use of rihl facilitates the establishment of one of our collateralized letter of credit facilities 
through rihl  certain of our operating subsidiaries invest in a diversified portfolio of highly liquid debt securities which are recorded at fair value 
rihl has been assigned a rating of aaaf s by s p and of the securities held through rihl have been assigned a rating of a or higher by nationally recognized rating agencies 
we may redeem our interests in rihl at the current net asset value no more frequently than monthly 
third party service providers perform custodial functions in respect of rihl  including valuation of the investment assets held through rihl 
currently  external investment managers manage the assets held through rihl  pursuant to written investment guidelines 
under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures are required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our reimbursement agreement as of december   made available to certain of our operating subsidiaries and joint ventures letters of credit having an aggregate face amount not to exceed billion 
as discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources  the commitments under the reimbursement agreement were subsequently reduced to million effective february   and if the sale of substantially all of our us based insurance operations is consummated  we expect to reduce the commitments under the reimbursement agreement by an additional million to million 
to support the reimbursement agreement  certain of our participating operating subsidiaries and joint ventures have pledged rihl shares and other securities owned by them as collateral 
at february   we had million of letters of credit with effective dates on or before december  outstanding under the reimbursement agreement 

table of contents effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
our estimates of the potential effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
in addition  as summarized in current outlook below  it is possible that the risk of general economic inflation has increased which could  among other things  cause claims and claim expenses to increase and also impact the performance of our investment portfolio 
the actual effects of this potential increase in inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until  among other items  claims are ultimately settled 
the onset  duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision 
off balance sheet and special purpose entity arrangements at december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations at december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations senior notes senior notes davincire revolving credit facility private equity and investment commitments operating lease obligations capital lease obligations other secured liabilities payable for investments purchased reserve for claims and claim expenses total contractual obligations includes contractual interest payments 
the interest on this facility is based on a spread above libor 
we have reflected the interest due in based upon the current interest rate on the facility 
the private equity and investment commitments do not have a defined contractual commitment date and we have therefore included them in the less than one year category 
we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
we have based our estimates of future claim payments upon benchmark industry payment patterns  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
we believe that it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances  many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances  these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default 

table of contents current outlook general economic conditions while economic conditions in the us and certain of our other key markets improved somewhat in the second half of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the strength  duration and comprehensiveness of any economic recovery 
while we believe the us federal monetary and tax actions taken towards the end of the year may support continued economic strengthening  we nonetheless also believe meaningful risk remains for continued uncertainty or disruptions in general economic conditions  including dislocations in the financial markets 
moreover  if economic growth continues  such growth may be only at a comparably suppressed rate for a relatively extended period of time 
while many governments  including the us federal government  took substantial steps in and to stabilize economic conditions  these stabilizing efforts have been coming to an end or are currently scheduled to cease in coming periods 
their cessation  or the roll back of stabilizing initiatives currently in place  could give rise to increased uncertainty  to a slowing of growth or even deterioration of economic conditions 
if the current economic conditions persist at their current levels or decline  demand for the products sold by us or our customers or our overall ability to write business at risk adequate rates could weaken 
in addition  persistent low levels of economic activity could adversely impact other areas of our financial performance  such as by contributing to unforeseen premium adjustments  mid term policy cancellations or commutations  or asset devaluation 
any of the foregoing or other outcomes of a prolonged period of economic weakness could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  during a period of extended economic weakness like the current one  we believe our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with customers  agents  brokers  retrocessionaires  capital providers and parties associated with our investment portfolio  among others  is likely to be increased 
various of these risks could materialize  and our financial results could be negatively impacted  even after the end of the economic downturn 
moreover  we continue to monitor the risk that our principal markets will experience increased inflationary conditions  which would  among other things  cause costs related to our claims and claim expenses to increase  and impact the performance of our investment portfolio 
the onset  duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision 
our catastrophe exposed operations are subject to the ever present potential for significant volatility in capital due primarily to our exposure to severe catastrophic events 
our specialty reinsurance portfolio is also exposed to emerging risks arising from the ongoing economic weakness  including with respect to a potential increase of claims in directors and officers  errors and omissions  surety  casualty clash and other lines of business 
declining interest rates and lower spreads during lowered the yields at which we invest our assets relative to historical levels 
we expect these developments  combined with the current composition of our investment portfolio and other factors  to continue to put downward pressure on our net investment income for the near term 
in and  our investment results benefited substantially from factors including spreads tightening and improving valuations at levels which we would not anticipate repeating in future periods 
in addition to impacting our reported net income  potential future losses on our investment portfolio  including potential future mark to market results  would adversely impact our equity capital 
moreover  as we invest cash from new premiums written or reinvest the proceeds of invested assets that mature or that we choose to sell  the yield on our portfolio is comparably impacted by the prevailing environment of comparably low yields 
while it is possible yields will improve in future periods  we currently expect the challenging economic conditions to persist and we are unable to predict with certainty when conditions will substantially improve  or the pace of any such improvement 
market conditions and competition with only four other years since having the level of named atlantic windstorm formation as  it proved to be an active year meteorologically  although these material tropical windstorms did not make significant landfall in the us atlantic and gulf coast regions and accordingly did not give rise to meaningful insured losses 
this followed a similar industry outcome in  in which us coastal regions exposed to severe hurricane risk benefited from an unusually inactive year meteorologically in the atlantic basin  which we believe was in part attributed to that year s el nino effect 
as a result  insured industry losses from atlantic windstorms in each of and were relatively benign  particularly in the eastern and southeastern us this was in contrast to 
table of contents  and  for example  in which hurricanes katrina  rita  wilma and ike  among others  resulted in substantial insured property losses 
however  was an active year for large insured seismic events  with significant earthquakes in chile and new zealand giving rise to material insured industry losses  and additional earthquakes in pakistan and  in particular  haiti  though largely uninsured  causing extensive loss of life 
despite these large seismic events  continued the trend toward increasingly ample supplies of capital  impacted by continuing recovery in the financial markets and in asset valuations  and a more positive perception of liquidity  decreasing demand  impacted by the same factors  and to a degree by exposure reduction 
in addition  the competitive conditions in the markets we serve are believed to have been meaningfully impacted in by the us federal government s financing and backstopping of certain large market participants  which are deemed by many market observers and participants to have contributed to inadequate pricing conditions in respect of certain lines and coverages  which conditions continued into while was also characterized on a full year basis by meaningful returns of capital  both by us and by participants in our industry more generally  following the relatively strong rebound in the financial markets  overall industry capital levels continue to reflect ample supply 
as a result of these and other factors  the january renewal season reflected continued softening and uncertainty in the predominant part of the markets in which we focus  and we currently expect these conditions to continue throughout the remainder of among other things  increased capital levels and appetite for risk among primary insurance companies may continue to lead to increased retentions  further impacting the reinsurance marketplace 
despite these dynamics and trends  we believe that our strong relationships  and track record of superior claims paying ability and other client service  will enable us to compete for the business we find attractive 
however  it is possible that industry pricing in our core product lines will decrease more rapidly than we anticipate  or that we will encounter more significant competitive barriers than we have in the past 
the market for our catastrophe reinsurance products is generally dynamic and volatile 
the market dynamics noted above  increased or decreased catastrophe loss activity  and changes in the amount of capital in the industry can result in significant changes to the pricing  policy terms and demand for our catastrophe reinsurance products over a relatively short period of time 
in addition  changes in state sponsored catastrophe funds  or residual markets  which have generally grown dramatically in recent years  or the implementation of new government subsidized or sponsored programs  can dramatically alter market conditions 
we believe that the overall trend of increased frequency and severity of catastrophic us atlantic and gulf coast region storms experienced in recent years may continue for the foreseeable future 
increased understanding of the potential increase in frequency and severity of storms may contribute to increased demand for protection in respect of coastal risks which could impact pricing and terms and conditions in coastal areas over time 
we do not believe that the comparably low level of weather related losses incurred in and  despite the active atlantic basin activity in those years  is indicative of the likely level of such losses in future periods 
overall  we expect higher property loss cost trends  driven by increased severity and by the potential for increased frequency  to continue over time in the future 
at the same time  certain markets we target are currently being impacted by fundamental weakness experienced by primary insurers  due to the ongoing economic dislocation and  in many cases  inadequate primary insurance rate levels 
these conditions  which occurred in a period characterized by unusually low insured catastrophic losses  have contributed to certain publicly announced instances of insolvency  regulatory supervision and other regulatory actions  and have weakened the ability of certain carriers to invest in reinsurance and other protections for coming periods  and in some cases to meet their existing premium obligations 
it is possible that these dynamics will continue in future periods 
in addition  we continue to explore potential strategic transactions or investments  and other opportunities  from time to time that are presented to us or that we originate 
in evaluating these potential investments and opportunities  we seek to improve the portfolio optimization of our business as a whole  the opportunity to enhance our strategy  an attractive estimated return on equity in respect of investments  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core operations 
legislative and regulatory update in april  the us house financial services committee approved hr  titled the homeowners defense act  by a vote of concurrently  the financial services committee passed legislation which would expand the national flood insurance program the nfip to cover damage to or loss of real or related personal 
table of contents property located in the us arising from any windstorm any hurricane  tornado  cyclone  typhoon  or other wind event this legislation  together with hr  is referred to below as the house bills 
hr would  if enacted  provide for the creation of i a federal reinsurance catastrophe fund  ii a federal consortium to facilitate qualifying state residual markets and catastrophe funds in securing reinsurance  and iii a federal bond guarantee program for state catastrophe funds in qualifying state residual markets 
while neither of the house bills was ultimately passed in the congress  members of both the house and senate continue to express support for this legislation and it remains likely this legislation or similar legislation will be considered in if enacted  any of these bills  or legislation similar to these proposals  would  we believe  likely contribute to the growth of state entities offering below market priced insurance and reinsurance in a manner adverse to us and market participants more generally 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation will continue to be vigorously opposed  if adopted these bills would likely diminish the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
throughout and into early  congress passed a series of short term extensions of the nfip 
in september  congress extended the program for a one year period  this extension is scheduled to expire september  according to public statements  both congress and the federal emergency management agency plan to continue to explore the possibility of new legislation which might reshape the federal flood insurance program  perhaps substantially 
expansions or weakening of the nfip program  or a failure to act on the expiring current program in a timely fashion  particularly if unanticipated by industry participants  could have dislocating impacts on the industry and our customers and potentially have an adverse impact on us 
in  the state of florida enacted legislation to expand the fhcf s provision of below market rate reinsurance to up to billion per season the florida bill 
in may of  the florida legislature enacted bill no 
cs hb the bill  which will gradually phase out billion in optional reinsurance coverage under the fhcf over the succeeding five years 
the bill increased the cost of the optional coverage  which is believed to have contributed to reductions in the amount of this coverage purchased by eligible insurers until the phase out is complete 
the bill similarly allows the state sponsored property insurer  citizens  to raise its rates up to starting in and every year thereafter  until such time that it has sufficient funds to pay its claims and expenses 
for  the approved rate increase for citizens was approximately 
the rate increases and cut back on coverage by fhcf and citizens are expected to support a relatively increased role of the private insurers in florida  a market in which we have established substantial market share 
this legislation may  however  take several years to have a significant effect on the private market  moreover  its impact may not be sufficient to restore stability to the florida market in light of certain trends that are adversely impacting the stability of local market participants  such as practices and findings relating to sinkhole claims  and the statutes of limitations on alleged windstorm claims from prior accident years 
these factors have contributed  for example  to a return to rapid growth in the policies issued by citizens rather than by private market insurers  diminishing the market in turn for our own coverages 
while legislation intended to ameliorate these and other issues for the florida market is expected to be introduced in the session  there can be no assurance that any such legislation will be enacted or that it will indeed succeed in improving the strength and stability of the florida market 
we believe the florida bill caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in and as compared to the florida bill and other regulatory actions over this period may have contributed to instability in the florida primary insurance market  where many insurers reported substantial and continuing losses in and  each unusually low catastrophe years 
because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the florida bill and the weakened financial position of florida insurers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other reinsurance market participants 
in addition  it is possible that other regulatory or legislative changes in  or impacting florida could affect our ability to sell certain of our products and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in july  us rep 
richard neal introduced the neal bill  which provides that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the obama administration included similar provisions in its formal and budgetary proposals 
in the event the sale of substantially all of our us based insurance operations does not close  we believe that passage of such legislation could adversely affect us  perhaps materially 

table of contents in march  us senator carl levin and rep 
lloyd doggett introduced legislation in the us senate and house  respectively  entitled the stop tax haven abuse act s 

rep 
doggett introduced similar legislation in and early if enacted  this legislation would  among other things  cause to be treated as a us corporation for us tax purposes generally  entities whose shares are publicly traded on an established securities market  or whose gross assets are million or more  if the management and control of such a corporation is  directly or indirectly  treated as occurring primarily within the us the proposed legislation provides that a corporation will be so treated if substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of the corporation who exercise day to day responsibility for making decisions involving strategic  financial  and operational policies of the corporation are located primarily within the us in addition  among other things  the legislation would establish presumptions for entities and transactions in jurisdictions deemed to be offshore secrecy jurisdictions and would provide a list of such jurisdictions 
to date  this legislation has not been approved by either the house of representatives or the senate 
however  we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not ultimately be adopted 
while we do not believe that the legislation would impact us  it is possible that an adopted bill would include additional or expanded provisions which could negatively impact us  or that the interpretation or enforcement of the current proposal  if enacted  would be more expansive or adverse than we currently estimate 
in july the dodd frank act was signed into law by president obama 
the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states  establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the bcfp  and will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the dodd frank act or the resulting regulations will impact the company s business 
however  compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs  which may adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
even if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government  new or additional state  federal or international financial sector regulatory reform  including the dodd frank act  could have a significant impact on us 
for example  legislative or regulatory changes  or their resultant impact on our market  could have an unexpected adverse effect on our customers  our competitive position or our rights as a creditor 
although we do not currently expect material adverse consequences to our business from the developments of which we are aware  we cannot assure you this expectation will prove accurate or that the dodd frank act or other developments will not impact our business more adversely than we currently estimate 
recent developments on february   an earthquake with a magnitude of on the richter scale struck the south island of new zealand near christchurch the february new zealand earthquake causing significant destruction 
while reported to have been smaller in magnitude  the epicenter of the february new zealand earthquake was both closer to christchurch and shallower than the magnitude earthquake that struck the region on september  these factors may contribute to significant insured economic losses in respect of this event 
while one leading catastrophe modeling company has estimated that total insured losses from the february new zealand earthquake will be between nzd billion and nzd billion  given the magnitude and recent occurrence of this event  there is a lack of data available from industry participants and clients  resulting in significant uncertainty with respect to potential insured losses from this event  and also with respect to our potential losses from this event 
due to the preliminary nature of the available information as to the february new zealand earthquake and the other factors described above  it is difficult at this time to provide an estimate of the financial impact of this event on the company 
at this time  we have not received meaningful loss or claims reports from brokers or clients 
based upon the current publicly available industry preliminary insured loss estimates  market share analysis  the application of our modeling techniques and a review of our in force contracts  our current preliminary assessment is that the impact of the february new zealand earthquake on our financial results net of reinstatement premiums  retrocessional recoveries and noncontrolling interest will be significant  and will likely be material 
losses from this event will be recorded in our first quarter results 
moreover  at this time it is too early to forecast what impacts  if any  the february new zealand earthquake may have on future market conditions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  energy and weather related risk  and equity price risk 
the company s guidelines permit investments in derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  options  swap agreements and other derivative contracts which may be used to assume risk or for hedging purposes 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments and short term investments  whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturity investments portfolio to fund operations  pay reinsurance and insurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in part by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at billion at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
we use interest rate futures within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  which can include increasing or decreasing our exposure to this risk 
at december   we had billion of notional long positions and million of notional short positions of primarily eurodollar  us treasury and us dollar futures contracts million and million  respectively 
we account for these derivatives at fair value and record them in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these derivatives as recognized in other assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december   was million million and million million  respectively 
during  we recorded losses of million gains of million  gains of million in our consolidated statement of operations related to these derivatives 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate upward parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately million at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our consolidated financial statements 
all changes in exchange rates  with the exception of non us dollar denominated investments classified as available for sale  are recognized currently in our consolidated statements of operations 
underwriting operations related foreign currency contracts our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
when necessary  we may use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
at december   the company had outstanding underwriting related foreign currency contracts of million in long positions and million in short positions  denominated in us dollars million and million  respectively 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
during  we generated a gain of million loss of million  loss of million  on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our underwriting operations 

table of contents investment portfolio related foreign currency forward contracts our investment operations are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar fixed maturity investments  short term investments and other investments 
at december   our combined investment in these non us dollar investments was million 
to economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising from non us dollar investments classified as available for sale are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar fixed maturity investments available for sale  realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar fixed maturity investments trading and other investments  and foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of operations

this was offset by a loss of million gain of million  loss of million on our non us dollar denominated investments 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income gain of million related to the change in unrealized foreign exchange losses gains on non us dollar investments which are classified as available for sale 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non us dollar investments 
energy and risk management operations related foreign currency contracts our energy and risk management operations are exposed to currency fluctuations through certain derivative transactions we enter into that are denominated in non us dollars 
the company may  from time to time  use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations 
at december   the total notional amount in us dollars of our energy and risk management operations related foreign currency contracts was million million 
for the year ended december   we generated gains of million incurred losses of million  generated gains of million on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our energy and risk management operations 
credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments  short term investments  premiums receivable and prepaid reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time  we purchase credit derivatives to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry  to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance  or to assume credit risk 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models and we record them on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates 
the fair value of these credit derivatives  as recognized in other assets in our balance sheet at december   was million other liabilities of million 
during  we recorded gains of million million  million in our consolidated statement of operations from our credit derivative positions 

table of contents energy and weather related risk energy and risk management operations we regularly transact in certain derivative based risk management products primarily to address weather and energy risks and engage in hedging and trading activities related to these risks 
the trading markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities  weather and other natural phenomena 
the unit which conducts these activities also transacts business which contemplates the physical delivery of energy related commodities  including natural gas 
currently  a significant percentage of our derivative based risk management products are transacted on a dual trigger basis combining weather or other natural phenomenon  with prices for commodities or securities related to energy or agriculture 
the fair value of these contracts is obtained through the use of quoted market prices  or in the absence of such quoted prices  industry or internal valuation models 
generally  our current portfolio of such derivative contracts is of comparably short duration and such contracts are predominantly seasonal in nature 
over time  we currently expect that our participation in these markets  and the impact of these operations on our financial results  is likely to increase on both an absolute and relative basis 
it is possible the duration of derivative contracts in this portfolio will lengthen in the future 
we use  among other things  value at risk var analysis to monitor the risks associated with our energy and weather derivatives trading portfolio 
var is a tool that measures the potential loss that could occur if our trading positions were maintained over a defined period of time  calculated at a given statistical confidence level 
due to the seasonal nature of our energy and weather derivatives trading activities  the var is based on a rolling two season one year holding period assuming no dynamic trading during the holding period 
a confidence level is used for the var analysis 
a confidence level implies that within a one year period  the potential loss in our portfolio is not expected to exceed the var estimate in of the possible modeled outcomes 
in the remaining estimated of the possible outcomes  the anticipated potential loss is expected to be higher than the var figure  and on average substantially higher 
the var model  based on a monte carlo simulation methodology  seeks to take into account correlations between different positions and potential for movements to offset one another within the portfolio 
the expected value of the risk factors in our portfolio is generally obtained from exchange traded futures markets 
for most of the risk factors  the volatility is derived from exchange traded options markets 
for those risk factors for which exchange traded options might not exist  the volatility is based on historical analysis matched to broker quotes from the over the counter market  where available 
the joint distribution of outcomes is based on our estimate of the historical seasonal dependence among the underlying risk factors  scaled to the current market levels 
we then estimate the expected outcomes by applying a monte carlo simulation to these risk factors 
the joint distribution of the simulated risk factors is then filtered through the portfolio positions  and then the distribution of the outcomes is realized 
the th percentile of this distribution is then calculated as the portfolio var 
the major limitation of this methodology is that the market data used to forecast parameters of the model may not be an appropriate proxy of those parameters 
the var methodology uses a number of assumptions  such as i risks are measured under average market conditions  assuming normal distribution of market risk factors  ii future movements in market risk factors follow estimated historical movements  and iii the assessed exposures do not change during the holding period 
there is no guarantee that these assumptions will prove correct 
we expect that  for any given period  our actual results will differ from our assumptions  including with respect to previously estimated potential losses and that such losses could be substantially higher than the estimated var 
at december   the estimated var for our portfolio of energy and weather related derivatives  as described above  calculated at an estimated confidence level  was million 
the average  low and high amounts calculated by our var analysis during the year ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
cat linked securities in addition  we have entered into a credit derivatives agreement with respect to cat linked securities whereby we have sold cat linked securities with a par amount of million at december  million to a bank  while retaining the underlying risk 
the agreement allows us to repurchase these securities at par and obligates us to repurchase the securities under certain circumstances including catastrophe triggering events and 
table of contents events of default 
as a result of this transaction  we are receiving the spread over libor for each of the cat linked securities subject to the credit derivatives agreement  less a financing fee 
the credit derivatives agreement is accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other income 
we recognized million million  million of other income in our consolidated statements of operations in from this transaction 
a decrease in the value of securities underlying the credit derivatives agreement would negatively impact our results by million 
equity price risk we are indirectly exposed to equity price risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets  such investments totaled million at december  million  and our investments in other ventures  under equity method  which totaled million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the prices of these hedge funds  private equity partnerships and investments in other ventures  under equity method  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of these investments at december
