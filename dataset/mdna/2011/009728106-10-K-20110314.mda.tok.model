item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for more information 
the table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales  net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december   and gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson combined total amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are key distributors of our products  as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them 
a c hange in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect for more information 
backorders 
as of december   we had approximately  of products on backorder as compared to approximately  of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all current open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  re call and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the application filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the application filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must  for example  provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and the dea 
in march  we receive an fda warning letter the warning letter following a routine inspection of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility in september the warning letter alleged violations of the current cgmp regulations 
we responded to the warning letter in april providing clarifying information and describing corrective actions planned and or completed after subsequent fda inspection of our decatur facility in july august and related communications between us and the fda  we were notified by the fda in december that all cgmp issues had been satisfactorily resolved  resulting in removal of the warning letter potential restrictions on new product a pprovals  approval of the lyophilization and filling operations of the decatur facility and approval of the site transfer for manufacture of ic green to the decatur facility 
subsequent fda inspections  the most recent of which was conducted during august and september at our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility  have produced no observations resulting in warning letters 
the warning letter had no impact on fda approved products manufactured or distributed by our decatur facility  and we have continued to submit and received fda approval for the manufacture of additional new products at our manufacturing plants in decatur  illinois and somerset  new jersey 
throughout the five year period ended december   there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or review activities 
product recalls 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by becton  dickinson and company bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
we recorded a  additional provision to sales returns in to recognize the impact of this recall 
in  we recorded an additional sales returns provision of  which is net of a  settle ment we received from bd related to the cyanide antidote kit recall 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the agency of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls during or dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
there were no dea citations issued to us in or environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately   and  of our net revenue  respectively  was from customers located in foreign countries 
seasonality and other cyclical sales fluctuations 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality 
we do market certain allergy products that typically generate higher sales volume in the warmer months  but these products do not materially impact our overall sales trends 
additionally  we market various antidote products through our hospital drugs injectables segment  the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our ongoing customers 
the products we previously marketed through our biologics vaccines segment were subject to seasonal fluctuations  with td vaccines sold in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products typically sold in the august through november period 
we discontinued distribution of flu vaccines during and ceased distribution of td vaccines as of march  upon the termination of our mbl distribution agreement 
government contracts 
none of our business segments are generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
availability under our credit agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements 
we are party to a revolving credit agreement with ej funds lp ej funds  a company controlled by our chairman  dr 
john kapoor 
this credit agreement was originally entered into on january  as a million revolving credit agreement between general electric capital corporation ge capital and us 
on february   ge capital applied a reserve against availability under the credit agreement due to concerns about our prospective compliance with certain covenants  capping our borrowing availability at its then current outstanding balance  which was  on march   we consented to an assignment of rights and obligations under the credit agreement from ge capital to ej funds 
at that time  availability was capped at  but was subsequently increased to million on august  upon completion of negotiations with ej funds 
under the negotiated terms  agreed to in the negotiations  we were not subject to debt covenants until april  and therefore had no limit on availability through that date 
however  after that date  availability is dependent upon our maintaining compliance with various covenants 
should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants  availability under the credit agreement could be restricted which would negatively impact our liquidity and may require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations or to fund growth opportunities 
we may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business 
it is possible that we will require additional funds in order to materially grow our business 
we require substantial liquidity to implement long term cost savings and productivity improvement plans  continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing plants to increase capacity and support product development programs  meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities  and run our normal business operations 
we may seek additional funds through public and private financing  including equity and debt offerings 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient additional capital funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product development  manufacturing  acquisition  licensi ng and marketing initiatives  or operations 
further  such additional financing  if obtained  may require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by general economic conditions  a volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if the current equity and credit market conditions do not improve  we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing  or obtaining such financing may be more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
a prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement  pricing or sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
failure to secure any necessary financing i n a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans 
there is also a possibility that our stock price may decline  due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales  net revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three wholesalers amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total net revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies 
the loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
a change in purchasing patterns or inventory level s  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance tha t we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully utilize our existing cash reserves to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify  acquire or develop new products to market and distribute 
we continue to seek out growth opportunities  either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products 
continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis  whether developed internally or by third party partners  or acquired from other companies 
in december  the joint venture company sold all of its andas to pfizer for million in cash  of which our share was million 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities and or acquire or develop new products to compensate for the loss in ongoing revenue  income and cash flow from the joint venture company as a result of this sale 
any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets  or acquire o r develop  and market and distribute new products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products  which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents  determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent  and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic d rugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete  or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if without merit 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell 
currently  due to our exit from the biologics vaccines segment  this risk is limited to a few akorn products that represent an immaterial percentage of our revenue and gross profit 
however  we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our two manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute such products as planned 
further  no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to pr ovide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the chairman of our board of directors is subject to conflicts of interest 
dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  the chairman of our board of directors and a principal shareholder  is the president of ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
dr 
kapoor is also a lender to us  providing us with a  revolving credit agreement through ej funds  an entity for which ej financial is the sole general partner 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
we are particularly dependent upon john n 
kapoor  phd  chairman of our board of directors 
in addition to serving as our chairman  dr 
kapoor is also currently our primary lender on our  revolving credit agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facility and subordinated debt 
the departure of dr 
kapoor as our chairman or the removal of his financial support from our business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
mr 
rajat rai currently serves as our chief executive officer under the terms of a consulting agreement expiring on december   subject to a twelve month renewal thereafter 
our inability to retain mr 
rai  or the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  and on our results of operations and financial condition 
through stock ownership  his position on our board of directors  and his loans to us  dr 
john kapoor has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies 
dr 
john kapoor  who serves as chairman of our board of directors  owns  directly and indirectly  a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock 
further  dr 
kapoor is a substantial akorn creditor 
as a result  dr 
kapoor can strongly influence  and potentially control  the outcome of our corporate actions  including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control 
decisions made by dr 
kapoor with respect to his  and his related parties  ownership or trading of our common stock  or with regards to our outstanding debt  could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal pro secution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
we are subject to regulation by the fda 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationship s 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
fda interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies  industry trends  and or prevailing scientific rationale 
if the fda changes its regulatory position due to such factors  it could result in our delay or suspension of the manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain of our products 
we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of products we market are non application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the amendment of the fdc act 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing of such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products  or items within our products  may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the fda of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls in or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of ours 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  iii our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products  or iv competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted o r are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  virtually all the drug products that we market are generics  with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached 
while this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or purchase and obtain fda approval to market our generic products  it also allows competing drug companies to do the same 
should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market  our profit margins could decline  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have registered shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements filed with the sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 
exercise of warrants and options may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock

we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in the sales of certain of our products  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key pers onnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants

our cash reserves were significantly bolstered by the million we received from the joint venture company s sale on december  of all of its andas to pfizer  inc this transaction has provided us with capital that we expect to use to fund future growth plans and opportunities 
our success during built on the momentum created by our new management team in the second half of  during which time we focused on cost containment  improved business practices and inventory management  and accelerating our r d activities to lay the groundwork for future growth

at the end of the first quarter of  we exited the biologics vaccines segment 
beginning in  we had been engaged in the marketing  sale and distribution of tetanus diphtheria td vaccines and influenza flu vaccines on behalf of various manufacturers 
we terminated distribution of flu vaccines in and terminated the distribution of td vaccines in march our exit from this segment was the result of a strategic decision to focus on our three core product segments and was hastened by our inability to reach agreement with mbl regarding the terms of a new td vaccine purchase agreement 
we remain committed to growing our three core segments ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables  and contract services 
results of operations for the years  and  we have identified and reported operating results for four distinct business segments ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables  contract services  and biologics vaccines 
our reported results by segment are based upon various internal financial reports that disaggregate certain operating information

the increases in our core segments ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables and contract services offset a  decline in biologics vaccines segment revenues due to our exit from this segment in march our revenues of  was net of adjustments totaling  for chargebacks  rebates  administration fees  returns  discounts and allowances 
chargeback and rebate expense for was  or of gross revenue  compared to expense of  or of gross revenue 
the  increase in chargeback expense was due to higher gross sales volume in as well as an increase in the percentage of our sales that were through group purchasing organization gpo contracts and thereby subject to chargeback adjustments 
this second factor  along with a shift in segment mix due to our exit from the biologics vaccines segment  were the primary reasons that chargeback and rebate expenses increased as a percentage of gross sales in  our products returns provision was  in compared to  in this  decrease was due to improved inventory management practices and a related reduction of inventory days of our product at the major wholesalers  which resulted in lower actual product returns and a reduction to potential future returns 
our consolidated gross profit for was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  in this gross profit increase of  or  was due to several factors  including our introduction of new products in carrying higher profit margins  improved plant utilization and stable wholesaler inventory levels during compared to a strategic decrease of wholesaler inventory levels in the gross profit margin on ophthalmic segment sales increased to in compared to in  and the gross profit margin on hospital drugs injectables increased to in compared to in the prior year 
these increases were due to a variety of factors  including sales from new products that carried higher profit margins  improved plant utilization  and selected price increases for cer tain of our existing products 
the gross profit margin on contract services increased to in compared to in the prior year  this increase being primarily attributable to improved plant utilization and price increases for certain products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in  a decrease of  or  from the prior year 
this small decrease in sg a expenses  despite the increase in sales volume  was primarily the result of significant cost reductions where we reduced personnel and travel costs  and also negotiated lower fees and operating costs with key service providers toward the end of and early this was partially offset by increased management bonus and stock option expense in accordance with our improved financial performance in research and development r d expenses were  in compared to  in this increase of  was the result of a renewed focus on enhancing our internal r d infrastructure in  as we opened a new r d center in skokie  illinois early in february and hired additional scientists to staff it 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of nda and anda drug acquisition costs over the anticipated market life of the acquired products 
amortization of intangibles was  in compared to  in this decline was due to prior year write downs of various intangible assets  along with the fact that we purchased no additional products in in  we incurred  in supply agreement termination expense related to the mbl distribution agreement for our distribution of td vaccine products 
we were unable to make scheduled payments to mbl in february and march  and negotiated a settlement agreement with mbl that changed our agreement from an exclusive to a non exclusive agreement and also eliminated the future minimum purchase commitments contained in the original agreement 
we incurred no similar expense in write off and amortization of deferred financing costs totaled  in compared to  in in each year  the majority of the expense was related to write offs 
in december  we early paid the balance due under our subordinated note  writing off  of unamortized deferred financing costs and  of early payment fee 
in the prior year  in march we wrote off  of deferred financing costs upon the assignment of our credit agreement from ge capital to ej funds 
interest expense was  in compared to  in the prior year 
this decline was related to a lower level of borrowing under our revolving credit agreement 
we repaid the outstanding balance during the quarter ended march  and made no subsequent borrowings 
we are a partner in the joint venture company  which we account for using the equity method 
during  we recorded  of equity in income from this unconsolidated joint venture  compared to  in the prior year 
of the  income in   was related to our share of the gain from the joint venture company s sale of its andas to pfizer on december   and the remaining  was from the joint venture company s operations 
the joint venture company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the rights to all of its andas to pfizer for million in cash 
this transaction is expected to result in income to akorn of  of which  was recognized in the fourth quarter of and the remaining   is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of the asset purchase agreement contains two closing dates  with some andas having been transferred on the initial close date of december  and the rest to be transferred on the final closing date of may  the gains are being allocated between these two dates based on the relative fair value of the andas transferred to pfizer on each date 
the joint venture company will continue to market and sell the actively marketed products through april  in the ordinary course of business  as defined in the asset purchase agreement 
thereafter  its operations are expected to essentially cease 
during and  we incurred non cash expenses of  and  respectively  related to the change in fair value of warrants we granted at various dates in to companies controlled by our chairman  dr 
john kapoor 
we classified the kapoor warrants as current liabilities from their grant dates until june   and adjusted their book values quarterly to reflect changes in their fair values 
as a result of an amendment to the registration rights agreement associated with these warrants  on june  we reclassified the kapoor warrants from current liabilities to a component of shareholders equity and made no subsequent fair value adjustments beyond that date

this decline related to lower sales of td vaccine  combined with our decision during to exit the distribution of flu vaccine 
ophthalmic revenue of  in was only slightly lower than our revenue of  for this segment 
hospital drugs injectables revenue declined by  or  in compared to the prior year due to targeted wholesaler reduction in stocking levels and decreases in sales volume of anesthesia and antidote products

the  decline in chargeback expense was related to the decrease in gross sales volume 
the increase in percentage of gross revenue was related to shifts in mix of our business  in part due to a decline in flu and td vaccine sales 
our products returns provision increased to  in from  in this  increase was due to an  provision related to the company s akten ophthalmic solution  along with increased provisi ons due to lower than anticipated pull through on ophthalmic products and an increase in anticipated returns from wholesalers on certain other products 
our consolidated gross profit for was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  in the  decline in gross profit was due to a combination of lower overall unit sales and lower gross profit margins across all of our segments 
the biologics vaccines gross profit margin was in compared to in  this decline being primarily attributable to an increase in the unit cost of td vaccines 
hospital drugs injectables segment margins declined to in from in primarily due to a shift in mix toward lower margin products 
the ophthalmic segment gross profit margin declined slightly from in to in  and the contract services gross profit margin declined from in to in these declines are primarily related to changes in product mix and unabsorbed overhead resulting from a targeted reduction in wholesaler days on hand and a corresponding reduction in production 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in  a decrease of  or  from the prior year 
decreases in salaries  wages and related costs accounted for approximately million of this overall decrease 
as part of our overall cost cutting initiative  various positions were restructured or eliminated  resulting in severance expense of  for the year  less was paid out for sales commissions  and our fringe benefits expense declined  in part due to suspension of our k employer match as of may  travel and entertainment expenses declined by approximately million in compared to the prior year

this increase was due to an overall increase in borrowing levels in compared to the prior year 
we incurred  in expense in for the write off and amortization of deferred financing costs  as we signed a new revolving debt agreement with ge capital in january and subsequently wrote off the related deferred financing costs of  in march when the agreement was assigned from ge capital to ej funds 
during  we also incurred non cash expense of  related to the change in fair value of stock warrants issued during the year 
no similar expenses were recorded in for the year  we recorded  of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture related to our proportionate share of the earnings of the joint venture company 
in  we recorded  of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture related to the joint venture company 
this increase was due to increased sales volume in compared to  which was the first year the joint venture company began selling product 
financial condition and liquidity overview we had cash and cash equivalents of  as of december  compared to  as of december   an increase of  our net working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  this increase of  was primarily due to the  distribution we received from the joint venture company related to the sale of its andas to pfizer on december   as well as our positive operating cash flows during the year 
during  we generated  in positive cash flow from operations 
this positive operating cash flow was primarily due to the combination of  of net income  plus  of non cash expenses 
these positive cash flows were partially offset by  amount for the equity in earnings of the joint venture company  a  increase in inventories  and a  increase in accounts receivable 
in  we generated negative cash flow from operations of only  despite the fact that our net loss for the year was  this loss and our use of  to pay down accounts payable were largely offset by a  reduction in inventory and  on non cash expenses 
in  we generated  in cash flow from investing activities 
the primary source of this positive investing cash flow was  in distributions from the joint venture company  of which  was received on december  as our proportionate share of the proceeds from the joint venture company s sale of its andas to pfizer on december  partially offsetting these positive cash flows was  of cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  much of which was used for capital projects to expand production capabilities at our manufacturing plants 
in  we used  of cash for investing activities  consisting of  used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and  used to acquire drug product licensing rights 
we used  in cash related to financing activities in in the fourth quarter  we used  in cash to early pay the balance due under our subordinated note  plus applicable early payment fee  and we used  in the first quarter to pay off the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
these uses of cash were partially offset by  in cash generated from a private sale of stock to serum and subsequent warrant exercise  and  of proceeds from issuance of stock under our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
in  financing activities provided us with cash of  consisting of  borrowed under our revolving credit facility and  generated from employee stock plan activity  partially offset by  used to pay loan origination fees

on january   the parties entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which  among other things  reduced the number of financial covenants to two a limit on capital expenditures of  in   in  and  in and a requirement to have positive liquidity throughout the life of the credit agreement 
positive liquidity is defined as the revolving line of credit borrowing base up to  plus cash and cash equivalents less the outstanding principal on the revolving line of credit  the total of which must be greater than zero 
the capital expenditures limit allows that any unused portion from one year may be carried over and added to the next year s limit 
on january   we and ej funds signed a waiver and consent that waived our obligation to comply with the capital expenditure limit for subordinated debt on july   we borrowed  from the kapoor trust dated september   the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of which is dr 
john n 
kapoor  the chairman of our board of directors and the holder of a significant stock position in the company  in return for issuing the trust a subordinated note 
the subordinated note accrued interest at a rate of per year and was due and payable on july  on august   we refinanced our  subordinated note payable to the kapoor trust 
the principal amount was increased to  to include interest accrued through august  and the term of the subordinated note was extended by an additional five years to august  the interest rate remained unchanged at per year  and interest on the refinanced note was payable monthly 
as part of this refinancing agreement  we issued to the kapoor trust an additional  warrants the subordinated note warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of  the closing price of the our stock on august  the fair value of these warrants on august   as calculated using a black scholes valuation model  was  this amount  along with  in legal fees  was capitalized as deferred financing costs and was being amortized over the term of the subordinated debt 
on december   we voluntarily prepaid the principal of the subordinated note  along with a early payment fee and all accrued interest 
our total cash payment on december   including principal  accrued interest  and the early payment fee  was  upon completing this early payment we expensed the remaining  unamortized balance of the  in deferred financing costs incurred when we refinanced the subordinated note 
other indebtedness in june  we entered into a year   mortgage agreement with standard mortgage investors  llc 
the mortgage note bore a fixed interest rate of and was secured by the real property located in decatur  illinois 
the final payment of principal and interest was completed in the second quarter of to retire this mortgage 
preferred stock and warrants series b preferred stock and warrants on august   we issued to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of series b participating preferred stock series b preferred stock at a price of per share  that was convertible into common stock at a price of per share  with warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the series b warrants 
there were  series b warrants outstanding as of december  these remaining warrants expired unexercised on august  we received net proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of the series b preferred stock 
this dollar amount is net of investment banker fees and expenses and other transaction costs of approximately  other warrants pipe warrants on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement with various investors at a price of per share which included warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock 
the warrants were exercisable for a five year period ended march  at an exercise price of per share and may be exercised by cash payment of the exercise price or by means of a cashless exercise 
holders submitted  warrants for cashless exercise during  leaving  remaining outstanding as of december  subsequently  during the period from january  through march   holders submitted  of the warrants for exercise 
the remaining  warrants expired unexercised on march  kapoor warrants during  in connection with modifications to our subordinated note  credit agreement and mbl distribution agreement  we granted various warrants to acquire our common stock the kapoor warrants to ej funds and the kapoor trust  companies controlled by the chairman of our board of directors  dr 
john n 
kapoor 
each of the kapoor warrants will expire five years after its grant date  if not exercised 
the fair value of each of the kapoor warrants was calculated at their grant dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
from their grant dates until june   the kapoor warrants were classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in their calculated fair values 
increases in fair value  or decreases in fair value to  but not below  their initial calculated fair values  were recorded as non operating expenses or income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the applicable periods 
we classified the fair value of the kapoor warrants as a current liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  formerly eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
this is a result of a requirement in the registration rights agreement entered into among the kapoor trust  ej funds and us on august  that the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants be registered shares  which cannot be absolutely assured 
on june   we entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement the amended agreement with dr 
kapoor which modified certain terms related to our obligation to obtain and maintain registration of any shares issued pursuant to exercise of the kapoor warrants 
the amended agreement still requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement pursuant to rule of the securities act of registration statement for any shares of common stock that may be issued under the applicable warrant agreements  and to maintain the continuous effectiveness of such registration statement until the earliest of i the date no shares of the our common stock qualify as registrable securities  ii the date on which all of the registrable securities may be sold in a single transaction by the holder to the public pursuant to rule or similar rule  or iii the date upon which the john n 
kapoor trust dated september  the kapoor trust and ej funds  lp ej funds have transferred all of the registrable securities 
however  the registration rights agreement has been amended to explicitly state that in the event that we  after using good faith commercially reasonable efforts  are not able to obtain or maintain registration of the common stock  delivery of unregistered shares upon exercise of the kapoor warrants will be deemed acceptable and a net cash settlement will not be required 
the amended agreement further provides that the term commercially reasonable efforts in such instance shall not mean an absolute obligation of ours to obtain and maintain registration 
on june   upon entering into the amended agreement  we completed a final black scholes calculation of the fair value of the kapoor warrants and adjusted their book value accordingly  then reclassified the kapoor warrants from a current liability to a component of shareholders equity 
no future fair value adjustments are required 
the increases in fair value of the kapoor warrants have been recorded as expenses under the caption change in fair value of warrants liability in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and we recorded expenses of  and  during and  respectively  related to the increase in fair value of the kapoor warrants 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the warrants at june  and december  were as follows june  december  expected volatility expected life in years risk free interest rate dividend yield the following table provides summarized information about the kapoor warrants fair values s granted to warrant identification grant date warrants granted exercise price at grant dates as of as of ej funds modification warrants apr  kapoor trust reimbursement warrants apr  ej funds credit facility warrants aug  kapoor trust subordinated note warrants aug  footnotes the modification warrants were granted to ej funds on april  when we signed the modification agreement with ej funds related to modifications made to our credit agreement following its assignment from ge capital to ej funds on march  those modifications included resetting the maximum loan commitment to  and setting the interest rate at a fixed per annum  among others 
the reimbursement warrants were granted to the kapoor trust on april  when we entered into a reimbursement and warrant agreement the reimbursement agreement with ej funds and the kapoor trust pursuant to which the kapoor trust agreed to provide the l c as security for our payment obligations to mbl under the mbl letter agreement and the mbl settlement agreement 
the credit facility warrants were granted to ej funds on august  in connection with the negotiated modification to the credit agreement increasing the total loan commitment from  to the subordinated note warrants were issued to the kapoor trust on august  in connection with refinancing the subordinated note to extend its term for an additional five years and increase the principal from  to  to include accrued interest through august  contractual obligations in our efforts to continually increase and update the list of pharmaceutical products that we market and sell  we will from time to time partner with outside firms for the development of selected product 
these development agreements frequently call for the payment of milestone payment as various steps in the process are completed in relation to product development and submission to the fda for approval 
the dollar amount of these payments is generally fixed contractually  assuming that the required milestones are achieved 
however  the timing of such payments is contingent based on a variety of factors and is therefore subject to change 
the amounts disclosed below under the caption strategic partners contingent payments represents our best estimate of the amount and expected timing of the milestone payments and other fees we expect to pay to outside development partners based on our current contractual agreements with them 
as more fully described in properties on page  we lease the facilities that we occupy in gurnee  lake forest and skokie  illinois and in somerset  new jersey 
we also lease various office equipment at these facilities and our manufacturing plant in december  illinois 
our remaining obligations under these leases are summarized in the table below 
on december   we paid off the outstanding principal balance payable under our subordinated note  and as of december   we had no outstanding balance under our  revolving credit facility 
accordingly  we have no current or long term debt outstanding at december  related to either the subordinated note or the credit facility 
the following table details our future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands description total and beyond current and long term debt leases strategic partners contingent payments total note the strategic partner payments are estimates which assume that various contingencies and market opportunities occur in and beyond on march   we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with the massachusetts biologic laboratories of the university of massachusetts medical school mbl to be the distributor for their tetanus diphtheria td vaccines in the united states the mbl distribution agreement 
the mbl distribution agreement obligated us to minimum purchase quantities in exchange for being mbl s exclusive distributor of td vaccines 
we were subsequently unable to meet our payment obligations to mbl in february and march  falling  in arrears 
accordingly  we entered into a letter agreement with mbl on march  mbl letter agreement  pursuant to which we agreed to pay mbl the  remaining due for these td vacci ne products plus an additional  in consideration of the amendments to the mbl distribution agreement payable according to a periodic payment schedule through june  the settlement payments 
in addition  pursuant to the mbl letter agreement  the mbl distribution agreement was converted to a non exclusive agreement  we became obligated to provide mbl with a standby letter of credit the l c to secure our obligation to pay amounts due to mbl  and we were released from our obligation to further purchase td vaccine products from mbl upon providing mbl with such l c 
in addition  pursuant to the mbl letter agreement  mbl agreed not to declare a breach or otherwise act to terminate the mbl distribution agreement if we complied with the terms of the mbl letter agreement  the mbl distribution agreement as amended by the mbl letter agreement and any agreements required to be entered into pursuant to the mbl letter agreement 
on april   we entered into a settlement agreement with mbl the mbl settlement agreement 
see item business for more information regarding the mbl letter agreement 
the mbl settlement agreement provided that we will pay mbl the settlement payments according to a monthly payment schedule through june  the mbl settlement agreement provided that mbl could only draw on the l c if i we failed to make any settlement payment when due  ii any settlement payment made was set aside or otherwise required to be repaid by mbl  or iii we became the debtor in a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding that began before october  and no replacement letter of credit had been issued prior to the expiration of the l c 
on april   we entered int o a reimbursement and warrant agreement the reimbursement agreement with ej funds and the kapoor trust pursuant to which the kapoor trust agreed to provide the l c as security for our payment obligations to mbl under the mbl letter agreement and the mbl settlement agreement 
simultaneous with the delivery of the reimbursement agreement  the l c was issued by the bank of america in favor of mbl 
the reimbursement agreement provided  among other things  that we would reimburse the kapoor trust for any draws by mbl under the l c through the mechanism of causing the amount of the draws to become term indebtedness payable to the kapoor trust on the same terms as the revolving debt under the credit agreement 
all of our obligations under the reimbursement agreement would also be considered secured obligations under the credit agreement 
pursuant to the reimbursement agreement  we also issued a warrant to the kapoor trust the reimbursement warrant to purchase  sha res of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the reimbursement warrant expires five years from the date of issuance and is exercisable upon payment of the exercise price in cash or by means of a cashless exercise yielding a net share figure 
in addition  the reimbursement agreement provided that if funds were drawn against the l c  we would be required to issue the kapoor trust additional warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  at per share  for every  drawn on the l c

the contract services segment  which produces products for third party customers based upon their specification at a pre determined price  also recognizes sales upon the shipment of goods or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate 
revenue is recognized when all of our obligations have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is probable 
provision for estimated doubtful accounts  chargebacks  rebates  discounts and product returns is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted  if necessary  at each balance sheet date 
allowance for chargebacks and rebates we enter into contractual agreements with certain third parties such as hospitals and gpos to sell certain products at predetermined prices 
the parties have elected to have these contracts administered through wholesalers that buy the product from us and subsequently sell it to those third parties 
when a wholesaler sells products to one of the third parties that are subject to a contractual price agreement  the difference between the price paid to us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the wholesaler 
we track sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each wholesaler 
utilizing this information  we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product 
we reduce gross sales and increase the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback amount for each product sold to a wholesaler 
we reduce the chargeback allowance when we process a request for a chargeback from a wholesaler 
actual chargebacks processed can vary materially from period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers 
however  our provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
we obtain certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness of the chargeback allowance that will be paid out in the future 
we assess the reasonableness of our chargeback allowance by applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to the quantities of inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of in transit inventory that is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the period 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our estimate of the percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement is based on a six quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers 
we use this percentage estimate until historical trends or new information indicates that a revi sion should be made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our actual chargeback rate experience and new trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
the historical percentages that we have used during  and are as follows period start date period end date estimated of wholesaler inventory that will be subject to contractual price agreements january  june  july  june  july  current we will continue to use the estimate in future periods until trends indicate that a revision should be made 
similarly  we maintain an allowance for rebates related to fee for service contracts and other programs with certain customers 
rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each eligible customer 
we track sales by product number for each eligible customer and then apply the applicable rebate percentage  using both historical trends and actual experience to estimate our rebate allowance 
we reduce gross sales and increase the rebate allowance by the estimated rebate amount when we sell our products to our rebate eligible customers 
we reduce the rebate allowance when we process a customer request for a rebate 
at each balance sheet date  we analyze the allowance for rebates against actual rebates processed and make necessary adjustments as appropriate 
actual rebates processed can vary materially from period to peri od 
however  our provision for rebates is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
the recorded allowances reflect our current estimate of the future chargeback and rebate liability to be paid or credited to our wholesaler and other customers under the various contracts and programs 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded chargeback and rebate expense of   and  respectively 
the allowances for chargebacks and rebates were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the current year decline in our allowance for chargebacks and rebates was the result of a strategic decline in inventory carrying levels of our products at key wholesalers combined with our phase out of td vaccines 
this decline resulted in lower volume of product being subject to future chargeback and rebate claims 
allowance for product returns certain of our products are sold with the customer having the right to return the product within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to pending expiration dates 
provisions are made at the time of sale based upon tracked historical experience  by customer in some cases 
we estimate our required product returns reserve based on historical percentage of returns to sales by product  considering actual returns processed to date  the expected impact of product recalls and current wholesaler inventory levels of our products to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in future product returns 
for new products  we assess the market dynamics for that product and consider our past returns experience for similar products in our portfolio 
until  we had estimated our required sales returns reserve based on our historical percentage of returns to sales utilizing a twelve month look back period 
in  we performed a specific detailed review of returns by product lot and determined that the lag time between product sale and return was longer than we had previously estimated 
the gross impact of this adjustment was  which was partially offset by  in reduced chargeback liability which specifically relates to this revision in the sales returns reserve estimate 
we recorded this change in estimate in the fourth quarter of one time historical factors or pending new developments that would impact the expected level of returns are taken into account to determine the appropriate reserve estimate at each balance sheet date 
the sales returns level can be impacted by factors such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for substitute products which can increase or decrease the end user pull through for sales of our products and ultimately impact the level of sales returns 
actual returns experience and trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
actual returns processed can vary materially from period to period 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a net provision for product returns of   and  respectively 
the decline in our provision compared to the prior two years was primarily the result of improving our inventory management practices and reducing wholesaler inventory levels of our products 
the provision included an  provision related to our akten ophthalmic solution  along with increases due to lower than anticipated pull through on ophthalmic products and an increase in anticipated returns from wholesalers on certain other products 
the provision includes the impact of discontinuing our multi dose td vaccine product  a recall associated with a supplier s syringe in our cyanide antidote kit product  the revi sion in our lag estimate  increased sales and unfavorable wholesaler product returns experience 
the allowances for potential product returns were  and  at december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions for doubtful accounts  which reflect trade receivable balances owed to us that are believed to be uncollectible  are recorded as a component of sg a expenses 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our historical experience with collections and write offs  the credit quality of our customers and any recent or anticipated changes thereto  and the outstanding balances and past due amounts from our customers 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a net expense benefit for doubtful accounts of   and  respectively 
the expense in was related to accounts newly identified as uncollectible  while the reversal of expense in was due to recoveries and a reduction to previously estimated reserve requirements 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of  of past due gross accounts receivable  of which  was more than days past due 
on a monthly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the receivables due from our wholesaler customers and provide a specific rese rve against known uncollectible items for each of the wholesaler customers 
we also include in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount that we estimate to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due receivables 
the percentage we reserve increases as the age of the receivables increases 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost average cost method or market 
we maintain an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value nrv 
for finished goods inventory  we estimate the amount of inventory that may not be sold prior to its expiration or is slow moving based upon recent sales activity by unit and wholesaler inventory information 
we also analyze our raw material and component inventory for slow moving items 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales of   and  respectively 
the allowance for inventory obsolescence nrv was  and  as of december  and  respecti vely 
the increase in the provision and allowance was mainly due to our decision to phase out certain products 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when  based on management judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints or impediments to approval 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the product timeline for approval 
warranty liability the product warranty liability primarily relates to a ten year expiration guarantee on dtpa products sold to hhs in we are performing yearly stability studies for this product and  if the annual stability does not support the ten year product life  we will replace the product at no charge 
our supplier  hameln pharmaceuticals  will also share one half of this cost if the product does not meet the stability requirement 
if the ongoing product testing confirms the ten year stability for the dtpa products we will not incur a replacement cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales after the ten year period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will likely be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recorded operating losses totaling  over the ten year period ended december   generating large net operating loss nol carry forwards during that time 
due to significant doubts regarding our ability to ultimately realize the benefits of those nol carry forwards  as of both december  and  we recorded valuation allowances equal to of our net deferred tax assets 
intangibles intangibles consist primarily of product licensing and other such costs that are capitalized and amortized on the straight line method over the lives of the related license periods or the estimated life of the acquired product  which range from years to years 
accumulated amortization was  and  at december  and  respectively 
amortization expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we regularly assess our intangibles for impairment based on several factors  including estimated fair value and anticipated cash flows 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock options 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is subjective and requires a certain amount of judgment 
we use an expected volatility that is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life assumption is based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post vesting terminations experience 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on us treasury securities in effect during the quarter in which the options were granted 
the dividend yield has historically been set at zero  reflecting the fact that we have not historically issued dividends and do not anticipate issuing dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements during the second quarter of  we adopted guidance issued by the fasb in april that requires entities to provide disclosure of the fair value of all financial instruments within the scope of asc  financial instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate that value  in interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements 
our cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt obligations approximate fair value at december  and during the second quarter of  we adopted asc  subsequent events formerly sfas no 
 subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued for interim and annual periods ending after june  we have considered the accounting and disclosure of events occurring after the balance sheet date through the date and time of issuance of our financial statements 
the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had no debt 
further  our existing  credit facility carries a fixed interest rate of 
accordingly  we have no market risk related to debts 
we have no material foreign exchange risk 
foreign sales are immaterial to our total sales and are all transacted in us dollars 
our cash and debt is entirely denominated in us currency 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of  were held in accounts that were not subject to market risk
