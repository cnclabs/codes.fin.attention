table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  with a nationwide portfolio in excess of stations in markets  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento and kansas city 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
net revenues are gross revenues less advertising agency commissions 
the revenues are determined by the advertising rates charged and the number of advertisements broadcast 
we maximize our revenues by managing the inventory of advertising spots available for broadcast  which can vary throughout the day but is consistent over time 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by an independent advertising sales representative 
local and national revenues include advertising on our stations  websites  the sale of advertising during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet  promotional activities and e commerce 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  programming and promotional expenses 
other significant expenses that impact our profitability are interest and depreciation and amortization expense 
our performance is based upon the aggregate performance of our radio stations 
the following are some of the factors that impact a radio station s performance at any given time i audience ratings  ii program content  iii management talent and expertise  iv sales talent and expertise  v audience characteristics  vi signal strength  and vii the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the associated risks and uncertainties 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations for the relevant periods represent the operations of the radio stations owned and operated by us  or operated by us pursuant to time brokerage agreements tbas  and exclude those owned by us but operated by others pursuant to tbas 

table of contents under the heading same station considerations  we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
in addition  another party commenced operation of a number of our tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of certain non strategic tower sites  which also impacted same station considerations when comparing the years with and with we use these comparisons to assess the effect of acquisitions and dispositions on our operations throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year financing during march  we amended our bank facility that increased our interest expense due to an increase in the amortization of deferred financing expense of million and an increase in the on going fees we pay under our bank facility 
during march  we repurchased the remaining million of our then outstanding notes at par and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of deferred financing expenses 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operating certain of our tower facilities and we received million in cash that was reflected as financing method lease obligations due to our ability to participate in future profits from these towers 
dispositions during  another party commenced operation of certain tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which decreased net revenues tower rental income and station operating expenses for same station considerations  but had a marginal impact on our reported results of operations 
other during the year ended  we recorded an impairment loss of million in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss carryforward and recovered million in same station considerations during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced the operation of certain of our tower sites 
for purposes of reporting same station information  the operation of these tower sites was eliminated from our reported results for the year ended december  for the year ended december  
table of contents net revenues would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
operating income would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change based upon our improved results for the current period as well as other indicators  we expect revenues to continue to grow into poor economic conditions in led to lower demand for radio advertising 
in  our revenues were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the economy and improving business conditions for both the industry and us 
net revenues in the current period increased in the majority of our markets 
our net revenues increased the most for those radio stations located in our denver  new orleans  rochester and san francisco markets 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in net revenues as described above as certain variable expenses increase with a corresponding increase in net revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to the decrease over the past several years in i capital expenditures  ii deferred charges and other assets  and iii acquisitions 

table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in non cash compensation expense  as the equity compensation awards that were granted in were granted late in the year with minimal expense impact  and certain previously granted awards did not affect as they were fully amortized in operating income years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the increase in operating income was primarily due to the absence of an impairment loss in the current period as compared to an impairment loss of million that was recorded in the second quarter of the prior year  and an increase in net revenues for the reasons described above under net revenues  net of an increase in station operating expenses for the reasons described under station operating expenses 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decline in outstanding debt  the repurchase of our notes  which had a higher interest rate than the funds borrowed to repurchase such notes  and a reduction in january of million in notional value of an existing fixed interest rate swap agreement 
interest rates on outstanding debt remained relatively flat during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was offset by an increase in the amortization of deferred financing expense of million  primarily from the amortization of the bank fees associated with the march amendment to our bank facility  and an increase in our bank facility fees that correlates to an increase in our leverage ratio during most of the third quarter of and into the fourth quarter of interest expense in could be favorably impacted by the expected reduction in outstanding debt in  and the expiration in of three existing fixed rate interest hedging transactions in the aggregate notional value of million 
this favorable impact could be offset by an increase in interest rates and fees associated with the amendment to our bank facility in the first quarter of 
table of contents income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change nmf the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income for the reasons as described above under operating income  which was partially offset by a million decrease in the gain on the retirement of our senior subordinated notes as we repurchased our notes at a discount in income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change income tax expense for was primarily due to the recording of net deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
these deferred tax liabilities cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense for the current period was offset by the reduction in liabilities from uncertain tax positions associated with the finalization of an audit by the internal revenue service 
as a result of cumulative losses incurred by the company since  a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was established due to the uncertainty that the deferred tax assets would be realized in future years after excluding deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets 
we have reported cumulative income since if we were to continue to report cumulative income in  we expect that it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance would significantly decrease in the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  in we reversed in excess of million of our valuation allowance for the federal portion of our deferred tax assets 
the company s income tax rate for the year ended december  was and for the year ended december  was not a meaningful number 
the tax rates for the years ended december  and were impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range excluding the impact of a valuation allowance or liabilities associated with non amortizable assets 
we anticipate that our rate in could be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have different income tax rates from states in which we currently operate and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions  taxes in certain states that are dependent on factors other than taxable income  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  ii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iii changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and iv changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under accounting guidance  we do not amortize our 
table of contents indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
the amortization of our indefinite lived assets for tax purposes but not for book purposes creates deferred tax liabilities 
a reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite lived intangibles become impaired  or are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the amortization for tax purposes and not book purposes of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods without consideration for any impairment loss in future periods 
net income years ended december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit and under income taxes benefit 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year financing during the years ended december  and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million and million  respectively 
our interest expense decreased due to i a decrease in interest rates  ii a decrease in our outstanding debt  and iii the redemption of a portion of our notes that had a higher interest rate than the average rate under our senior debt 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operating certain of our tower facilities and we received million in cash that was reflected as financing method lease obligations due to our ability to participate in future profits from these towers 
acquisition on march   we acquired through an exchange agreement three radio stations in san francisco  california  that in increased our depreciation and amortization expense as we acquired certain intangible assets with lives of a short duration 
dispositions during  another party commenced operation of certain tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which decreased net revenues tower rental income and station operating expenses for same station considerations  but had a marginal impact on our reported results of operations 
on july   we sold three of our eight rochester  new york  radio stations for net cash proceeds of million  which the buyer began operating on may  under a tba 
the results for these stations were reflected in discontinued operations 

table of contents on march   we sold  through an exchange agreement  three of our seven seattle  washington  radio stations that in resulted in a million gain on sale of assets 
on january   we sold an austin  texas  radio station for million in cash 
other the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  in we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss carryforward and recovered million in during the years ended and  we recorded an impairment loss of million and million  respectively  in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
in  our income tax benefit on loss from continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase to our valuation allowance of million to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets were also fully reserved in the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to the cumulative losses incurred by us since  which caused uncertainty as to the realization of the deferred tax assets in future years 
during  we recovered million from our insurance company for damages resulting from hurricane katrina 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed our carrying amount for the rochester assets then held for sale and determined that an impairment loss of million was necessary as a result of the status of our then ongoing divestiture process 
same station considerations during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced the operation of certain of our tower sites 
for purposes of reporting same station information  the operation of these tower sites was eliminated from our reported results for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net revenues would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period

net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change the economic downturn reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations during net revenues declined in most of the markets where we operate stations 
those markets that were impacted the most by the decline in radio station net revenue dollars were the boston  seattle  sacramento  san francisco and portland markets 
economic conditions sequentially improved throughout primarily due to the strengthening of advertiser demand 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the decrease in station operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues as described under net revenues as certain variable expenses decrease with a corresponding decrease in net revenues  and cost reduction initiatives that commenced during the fourth quarter of  including but not limited to reductions in workforce  the elimination of the k employer matching contribution and other cost reduction actions 
most of the cost cutting measures were fully realized in early depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as the expense in was higher due to acquisitions during the first quarter of and fourth quarter of  which included certain amortizable assets with lives of a short duration

operating income loss years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income loss amount of change percentage change the increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in impairment loss of million in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill in as compared to the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net revenues for the reasons described above under net revenues  net of a decrease in station operating expenses for the reasons described under station operating expenses  and a decrease in net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million as a result of the sale in of three of our seattle stations 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates on outstanding debt in as compared to  a decline in outstanding debt  and the repurchase of our notes  which have a higher interest rate than the interest rate on the borrowings under our bank facility used to repurchase our notes

the income tax benefit in primarily resulted from the elimination of deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets due to the recording of an impairment loss in of million 
the income tax benefit was offset by an increase to our valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets  as the cumulative losses incurred by us over the past several years caused uncertainty about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets

future impairments we may determine that it will be necessary to take impairment charges in future periods for various reasons 
our annual impairment test of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill was performed in the second quarter of we may be required to retest prior to our next annual evaluation  which could result in a material impairment 
as of december   no interim impairment test was required during for our broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to i reduce the indebtedness under our bank facility  ii repurchase our notes  iii repurchase shares of our class a common stock  and iv pay dividends to our shareholders 
generally  our cash requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our credit agreement  and sales of assets 

table of contents historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our bank facility 
in addition  we have outstanding financing method lease obligations of million and million in a letter of credit 
during the year ended december   we decreased our outstanding debt by million and  during the year ended  we decreased our outstanding debt by million which included a discount of million on the repurchase of our notes 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the term loan reduces in quarterly amounts  which payments started at million  are currently at million and ultimately increase to million 
we plan to fund the amortization of the term loan with cash flow from operations and our available revolver capacity 
our credit agreement our bank facility  with a syndicate of more than lenders as of december   is comprised of i a revolver of million  of which million is drawn and outstanding as of december   and ii a term loan of million  of which million is outstanding as of december  the revolver provides us with funds for working capital and general corporate purposes including capital expenditures  and  except as limited under the amendment  any one or more of the following repurchases of class a common stock  investments  dividends and acquisitions 
the bank facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the bank facility  as amended  is secured by a lien on all of our assets  other than our real property 
the undrawn amount of the revolver was million as of december  the amount available under the revolver is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing 
based on our financial covenant analysis as of december   we would be limited to borrowings significantly less than the undrawn limit unless such borrowings were used to repay indebtedness or for transactions that increase cash flow for purposes of covenant calculation 
on march   we amended our bank facility the amendment 
in connection with the amendment  certain key terms  as defined within the bank facility  were revised as follows the consolidated leverage ratio could not exceed seven times in and decreases quarterly to a ratio of six times as of december   depending on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated operating cash flow  we may elect an interest rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus fees that can range from to  or the base rate plus fees that can range from to  where the base rate is the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the eurodollar rate plus  and c the prime rate  and during periods when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds six times defined in the bank facility as a restricted period  we are a restricted in our ability to take certain actions including  but not limited to  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our stock  and b subject to additional limitations on acquisitions and investments 
the bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants which are defined terms within the agreement  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that decreases quarterly in from a ratio of times as of march  to a ratio that will not exceed six times as of december  and thereafter prior to the amendment  the consolidated leverage ratio could not exceed six times  and a minimum ratio of consolidated operating cash flow to consolidated interest charges of two times 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and all other terms of the bank facility as of december  as of december   our consolidated leverage ratio was times and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was times 
the following table presents the computations in thousands  other than the ratios of our consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined under our bank facility as of december

if we were to enter into an agreement with our lenders for covenant compliance relief  such relief could result in higher interest expense 
we believe that over the next months we can continue to maintain our compliance with these covenants 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next months  including our debt repayments 
our operating cash flow remains positive  and we believe that it is adequate to fund our operating needs 
as a result  we have not been required to rely upon  and we do not anticipate being required to rely upon  the revolver to fund our operations 
we plan to continue to use the revolver and cash flow from operations to fund the amortization of the term loan 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our bank facility and the failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek from time to time to amend our existing bank facility or obtain other funding or additional financing  which may result in higher interest rates 
amending our bank facility or obtaining other funding or additional financing prior to the expiration of the current agreement will be essential since the revolver balance outstanding will be due in full upon the expiration of the bank facility on june  
table of contents the amendment in march was treated as a modification to a debt instrument 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we recorded deferred financing costs of million related to the amendment  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the bank facility on a straight line basis for the revolver  and an effective interest rate method for the term loan 
in addition  unamortized deferred financing costs of million as of the amendment date will continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the bank facility 
while economic conditions in as compared to have improved  resulting in increased advertiser demand  the economy continues to be weak and plagued by high unemployment 
net revenues for the industry and us grew in the mid single digits in as compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that revenue trends will be positive in as the economy and the advertising environment continue their rebound 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net revenues  net of station operating expenses  and a recovery in of refundable income taxes 
this increase was offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the increase in net revenues 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in of million in net revenues  net of station operating expenses  and a decrease in of million in prepaid and refundable taxes

dividends any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors based upon the relevant factors at the time of such consideration  including  without limitation  compliance with the restrictions set forth in our bank facility 
previously  we have used a portion of our capital resources to pay dividends on a quarterly basis effective beginning with the first quarter of and ending with and including the third quarter of our board of directors has not declared any dividends since that time 
pursuant to our bank facility  as amended in march  during periods when our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds six times  we are prohibited from paying dividends 
share repurchase programs depending on market conditions and other factors  new share repurchase programs could be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
our most recent share repurchase program expired on june  option exchange program in february  our board of directors approved an amendment to the entercom equity compensation plan to permit a one time option exchange program the oep  which amendment was approved at the may shareholders meeting 
on april   we commenced the oep subject to shareholder approval by making an exchange offer to our eligible employees and non employee directors 
we offered such persons the opportunity to make an election to exchange all of their outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for a lesser number of restricted stock units rsus 
the exchange ratio under the oep was as follows option exchange ratio strike price options for rsus at least  but less than for or more for on may   following the may  expiration of the oep exchange offer  we granted million restricted stock units in exchange for million options 
as a result of the oep  the number of restricted stock units that can be issued under the plan was effectively increased by million as all restricted stock units granted did not count against the restricted stock sublimit 
in addition  the number of awards that can be issued under the plan was effectively reduced by million as all options that were exchanged will not be available for re grant under the plan 
senior subordinated note repurchases on march   we redeemed at par all of the remaining million notes outstanding 

table of contents on march   we issued million of notes due march  as of december   we had outstanding million  as we repurchased and retired  during the years and  million and million of the notes  respectively 
interest on the notes  which were in denominations of  each  accrued at the rate of per annum and was payable semiannually in arrears on march and september effective march   the notes were callable at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes were unsecured and ranked junior to our senior indebtedness 
our notes also required us to comply with certain covenants that limited  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will be between million and million 
credit rating agencies effective beginning in  we elected to discontinue our subscription to such ratings services 
on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s may evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
any future significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity by limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more than less than to to contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations financing method lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a our bank facility had outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december  the maturity under our bank facility could be accelerated if we do not maintain compliance with certain covenants 
b the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of our bank facility 
financing lease obligations outstanding include principal and interest expense 
when our continuing involvement in this transaction ceases in the year  we expect we will discontinue finance accounting and instead treat our obligations under the accounting guidance for capital and operating leases 
also  we will recognize additional obligations included in the above table that cover lease payments for the period subsequent to the month period of continuing involvement 
the term for each of the leases ranges from to years  which covers the period of continuing involvement and the period subsequent to continuing involvement 
for further discussion  see note  financing method lease obligations  in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 

table of contents a we have purchase obligations of million including contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
b in addition to the above  we have million in liabilities related to i a pending transaction to acquire the assets of a radio station in san jose  california  for million in cash  ii construction obligations of million  and iii our obligation to provide a million letter of credit 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and our operating results 
it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities  together with liabilities for uncertain tax positions  are reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax liabilities  including liabilities for unrecognized tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  in the normal course of business  many of our radio stations enter into operating leases for the rental of real property that facilitates the transmission and broadcast of our radio broadcast signal 
we enter into interest rate contracts collars and swaps to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we have  from time to time  divested certain of our radio stations and assets 
in connection with these divestitures  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as environmental liabilities 
we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however  such insurance may not cover any of  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  such insurance coverage could change in the future 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
in december  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire a radio station in san jose  california  for million in cash 
concurrently with entering into the asset purchase agreement  we entered into a tba and commenced operations on january  accounting guidelines for variable interest entities require that the primary beneficiary consolidate the entity into its financial statements 
as a result of our review  we determined that since we were not the primary beneficiary of this entity  we did not include the entity in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had no other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents market capitalization as of december  and  our total market capitalization was million and million  respectively  which was million and million more  respectively  than our equity book value 
as of december  and  our stock price was per share and per share  respectively 
the difference in market capitalization versus equity book value can be attributed to i a partial recovery in our stock price as compared to recent historical averages  and ii a reduction in equity book value due to impairments to broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the past several years 
see note  intangible assets and goodwill  in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment losses in and intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate our radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation in  we were not significantly impacted by the effects of inflation on our radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment  although the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the accounting standards were amended for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity 
these amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach for determining whether a variable interest provides the entity with a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis  and require an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
these amended standards were effective january  this adoption did not have any effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements which impacted  see note in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the amounts of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an 
table of contents advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have generally ranged between and of our outstanding receivables 
our accounts receivable reserve has been in the higher range over the past several years due to the economic uncertainties and its effect on our business and our customer base  with a reserve of and as of as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers or markets were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
our net income would be negatively impacted by per share basic and diluted  assuming a increase in our outstanding accounts receivable allowance of million as of december  assuming a full valuation allowance against any tax benefit 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
in and  we recorded full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets primarily due to our cumulative losses over the past three years 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is decreased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation of accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
excluding discrete items of tax  changes in our valuation allowance and impairment losses  our tax rate over the past several years has varied within a range of high to low 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december  would be an increase in income taxes of million and a decrease in net income of million net income per basic and diluted share of for the year ended december  
table of contents valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets at that date 
we must conduct impairment testing at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
after an impairment expense is recognized  the recorded value of these assets will be reduced by the impairment recognized and this will be the assets new accounting basis 
in and in  we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the risk adjusted discount rate used in the valuation of fair value  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type  the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including assumptions regarding each market s population  household income  retail sales and other factors that would influence advertising expenditures  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  the likely media competition within the market area  an effective tax rate assumption  and future terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
broadcasting licenses we perform our broadcasting license impairment test by evaluating our broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
for purposes of testing impairment  indefinite lived intangible assets are combined into a single unit of accounting 
since the broadcasting licenses in each market are operated as a single asset  each market s broadcasting licenses are a single unit of accounting 
we completed the impairment test for broadcasting licenses during the second quarter of and determined that the fair value of the broadcasting licenses was more than the amount reflected in the balance sheet for each of our markets and  accordingly  no impairment was recorded 
the methodology used by us in determining our key estimates and assumptions was applied consistently to each market 
as a result  the analysis for each market is the same 
of the seven variables identified above  we believe that the first three in clauses through above are the most important to the determination of fair value 
the following table reflects these estimates and assumptions used in as compared to the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test 
in general  when comparing the second quarter of to the second quarter of the discount rate decreased primarily due to a decrease in the estimated required returns on debt and equity of publicly traded radio companies  the market specific operating profit margin range remained relatively flat  and the market long term revenue growth rates were marginally higher for many markets as the outlook for the industry improved 

table of contents second second quarter quarter discount rates operating profit margin ranges of the company s markets to to long term revenue growth rate ranges of the company s markets to to we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our broadcasting licenses  however  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us  or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our broadcasting licenses below the amount reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges  which could be material  in future periods 
the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our radio broadcasting licenses as of june  for units of accounting where the carrying value of the licenses are considered material to our financial statements geographical markets 
rather than presenting the percentage separately for each unit of accounting  management s opinion is that this table in summary form is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the recoverability of the broadcasting licenses 
in addition  the units of accounting are not disclosed with the specific market name as such disclosure could be competitively harmful to us 
units of accounting as of june  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value greater greater greater to than than than to to number of units of accounting carrying value in thousands goodwill we performed our annual impairment test on our goodwill during the second quarter of by comparing the fair value for each reporting unit with the amount reflected on the balance sheet 
we determined that a radio market is a reporting unit and  in total  we assessed goodwill at separate reporting units four of our reporting units had no goodwill recorded as of june  
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the amount reflected in the balance sheet  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to a reporting unit may be impaired  and we are required to perform a second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we compare the amount reflected in the balance sheet to the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
to determine the fair value  we use an income and market approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
in step one of our goodwill analysis  we considered the results of the market approach and the income approach in computing the fair value of our reporting units 
in the market approach  we applied an estimated market multiple of between seven and a half times and eight times to each reporting unit s operating performance to calculate the fair value 
this multiple was higher than the six times multiple applied to all markets in the second quarter of management believes that these approaches are an appropriate measurement given the current market valuations of broadcast radio stations together with the historical market transactions  including those in recent months 
factors contributing to the determination of the reporting unit s operating performance were historical performance and management s estimates of future performance 

table of contents in the income approach  we utilized the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit the key estimates and assumptions are included in the table below 
the results of step one indicated that it was not necessary to perform the second step analysis in any of the markets tested 
as a result of the step one test  no impairment loss was recorded during the second quarter of we performed a reasonableness test by comparing the fair value results for goodwill by using the implied multiple based on our cash flow performance and our current stock price and comparing the results to prevailing radio broadcast transaction multiples 
the following table reflects certain key estimates and assumptions used in and in the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test 
the ranges for operating profit margin and revenue growth rates are for our markets 
in general  when comparing the second quarter of to the second quarter of the discount rate decreased primarily due to a decrease in the estimated required returns of the debt and equity of publicly traded radio companies  the market specific operating profit margin range narrowed  and the market long term revenue growth rate range narrowed

in addition  the reporting units are not disclosed with the specific market name as such disclosure could be competitively harmful to us

table of contents sensitivity analysis results of results of long term results of weighted revenue operating average growth performance cost of rate cash flow capital decrease decrease increase amounts in thousands broadcasting licenses impairment assumption sensitivity result incremental broadcasting licenses impairment goodwill impairment assumption sensitivity result incremental goodwill impairment total incremental impairment from sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was computed using data from step testing of goodwill during the second quarter of the discount rate to be used by a typical market participant reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows for the broadcast industry 
the same discount rate was used for each of our markets 
the discount rate is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity capital in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
the capital structure was estimated based upon data available for publicly traded companies in the broadcast industry 
operating profit margins are defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax and corporate allocation charges 
operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and national representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margins 
operating profit margins are projected based upon industry operating profit norms  which reflect market size and station type 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our radio stations in a market  but is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 
if the outlook for the industry s growth declines  then operating profit margins would be negatively impacted  which would negatively impact the value of our broadcasting licenses 
to determine the radio broadcasting industry s future revenue growth rate  management uses publicly available information on industry expectations rather than management s own estimates  which could be different 
in addition  these long term market growth rate estimates could vary in each of our markets 
using the publicly available information on industry expectations  each market s revenues were forecasted over a ten year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rate for the radio broadcast industry  which was further adjusted for each of our markets 
if the industry s growth is less than forecasted  then the fair value of our broadcasting licenses could be negatively impacted

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank facility 
from time to time  we may seek to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank facility would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest benefit or interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
during the year ended december   the following derivative rate hedging transactions to fix interest on our variable rate debt were outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate 
type fixed of notional effective libor expiration hedge amount date collar rate date amounts in millions swap january  n a january  collar february  cap february  floor swap march  n a september  swap may  n a may  total the net fair value based upon current market rates of the rate hedging transactions is included as derivative instruments in long term liabilities  which is based upon the maturity dates 
our rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the one month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the one month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the one month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
the fair value of our derivative instruments outstanding as of december  was a liability of million  which was a million decrease in the liability as compared to the balance as of december  this positive change was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in the remaining period of each derivative instrument as the forward interest rate to maturity remained relatively flat 
our credit exposure under our hedging agreements  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers  the minimal reliance on any one advertiser  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors
