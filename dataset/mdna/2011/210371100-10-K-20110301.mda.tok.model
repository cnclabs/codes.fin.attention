item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is an energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries and joint ventures organized around three business segments a generation business generation  a customer supply business newenergy  and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note to consolidated financial statements 
this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the regulated business es are to bge 
we discuss our business in more detail in item business section and the risk factors affecting our business in item a 
risk factors section 
in this discussion and analysis  we will explain the general financial condition of and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures  our net available liquidity and collateral requirements  and expected future expenditures for capital projects 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our consolidated statements of income loss 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we discuss our strategy 
then  we describe the business environment in which we operate including how recent events  regulation  weather  and other factors affect our business 
next  we discuss our critical accounting policies 
these are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
we highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we review our results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results  followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment 
we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  security ratings  capital resources  capital requirements  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements 
we conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks 
strategy our strategy is to provide innovative and risk mitigating energy products and solutions to north american wholesale and retail customers 
overall  we strive to serve our customers with diverse products and solutions to meet their energy needs 
in executing this strategy  we leverage our core strengths of maintaining and growing strong and diverse supply relationships with retail and wholesale customers  owning  developing  operating  and contracting for generation assets  integrating our expertise in managing physical and financial risks  and providing reliable  regulated utility service to customers 
our newenergy business focuses on sales of electricity  natural gas  and related products to various customers  including distribution utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  and commercial  industrial  governmental  and residential customers in competitive markets 
the retail newenergy customer supply operation combines a unified sales force with a customer centric model that leverages technology to broaden the range of products and services we offer  which we believe promotes stronger customer relationships 
this model focuses on efficiency and cost reduction  which we believe will provide a platform that is scalable and able to capitalize on opportunities for future growth 
newenergy obtains energy from both owned and contracted supply resources and actively manages these physical and contractual assets in order to derive incremental value 
additionally  newenergy is involved in the development  exploration and exploitation of natural gas properties 
our generation business has a fleet of plants that is strategically located in markets that support our customer facing business and includes various fuel types  such as coal  natural gas  oil  nuclear  and renewable sources 
we generally have load obligations greater than our generation output 
going forward  we intend to invest in generation assets in the markets where we serve load to provide a more efficient and balanced profile between our generation production and our customer load obligations 
our strategy is enabled by a fleet of generation facilities and our risk management capabilities 
this combination of our generation and newenergy businesses also allows us to operate in a manner so we can minimize our collateral requirements 
we discuss our collateral requirements in the collateral section 
bge  our regulated utility located in central maryland  provides standard offer service and distributes electricity and gas to customers 
bge is also focusing on enhancing reliability and customer satisfaction  and is implementing customer demand response initiatives  including a comprehensive smart grid initiative and a full portfolio of conservation programs 
the ability of energy consumers to choose their supplier  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies to improve our competitive position 
we actively anticipate and adapt to the business environment and regulatory changes that impact our industry 
we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit 
table of contents quality by making disciplined investment and capital management decisions to support our strategic initiatives in an efficient and effective manner 
business environment various factors affect our financial results 
we discuss some of these factors in more detail in item business competition section 
we also discuss these various factors in the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
throughout  volatility in the financial markets intensified  leading to dramatic declines in equity and commodity prices and substantially reduced liquidity in the credit markets 
most equity indices declined significantly  the cost of credit default swaps and bond spreads increased substantially  and credit markets effectively ceased to be accessible for all but the most highly rated borrowers 
in and  markets in which we operate were affected by declining prices for power  gas  and capacity 
we discuss the impact of declining commodity prices on our future earnings in more detail in the generation results section 
during and  we improved our liquidity and reduced our business risk in response to these market events 
we discuss our liquidity and collateral requirements in the financial condition section 
we continue to actively manage our credit risk to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our customer counterparty credit and other risks in more detail in the risk management section 
competition also impacts our business 
we discuss competition in more detail in item business competition section 
the impacts of electric competition on bge in maryland are discussed in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business electric competition section 
regulation maryland maryland psc in addition to competition  which we discuss in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business electric competition section  regulation by the maryland public service commission maryland psc significantly influences bge businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers of its electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge standard offer service rates the transmission rates determined by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
bge electric rates are shown on customer billings as separate components for delivery service ie base rates  electric supply commodity charge and transmission  and certain taxes and surcharges 
the rates for bge regulated gas business continue to consist of a delivery charge base rates as well as certain taxes and surcharges and a commodity charge 
purchase of supplier receivables effective july   bge  pursuant to maryland psc requirements  began to purchase receivables at a discount from third party competitive energy suppliers that provide our customers electricity and or gas 
the discount rate applied to the receivables is a regulated rate which is intended to cover bge costs associated with purchasing these receivables  such as uncollectibles  and is subject to an annual true up to reflect actual costs 
order approving membership interest sale in ceng to edf in october  the maryland psc issued an order approving the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf subject to the following conditions  with which both constellation energy and edf complied or are complying constellation energy funded a one time  per customer distribution rate credit for bge residential customers totaling million in the fourth quarter of constellation energy made a million equity contribution to bge in december to fund the after tax amount of the rate credit as ordered by the maryland psc 
constellation energy was required to make a million cash capital contribution to bge by no later than june  constellation energy made this equity contribution to bge in december bge will not pay common dividends to constellation energy if after the dividend payment  bge equity ratio would be below as calculated pursuant to the maryland psc ratemaking precedents  or bge senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade 
bge was prohibited from filing an electric and or gas distribution rate case at any time prior to january and was ordered not to file a subsequent electric and or gas distribution rate case until january any rate increase in the first electric distribution rate case was capped at as agreed to by constellation energy in its settlement with the state of maryland and the maryland psc 
in may  bge filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the maryland psc and the maryland psc issued its order on the case in december we discuss this matter further in the base rates section below 
constellation energy is limited to allocating no more than of its holding company costs to bge until the maryland psc reviews such cost allocations in the context of bge next rate case 
constellation energy and bge implemented ring fencing measures in february designed to provide bankruptcy protection and credit rating separation of bge from constellation energy 
such measures include the formation of a new special purpose subsidiary by constellation energy to hold all of the common equity interests in bge 
maryland settlement agreement in march  constellation energy  bge  and a constellation energy affiliate entered into a settlement agreement with the state of maryland  the maryland psc and certain state of 
table of contents maryland officials to resolve pending litigation and to settle other prior legal  regulatory  and legislative issues 
on april   the governor of maryland signed enabling legislation  which became effective on june  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement each party acknowledged that the agreements adopted in relating to maryland electric restructuring law are final and binding and the maryland psc closed ongoing proceedings relating to the settlement 
bge provided its residential electric customers approximately million in the form of a one time per customer rate credit 
we recorded a reduction to electric revenues on our and bge consolidated statements of income loss during the second quarter of and reduced customers bills by the amount of the credit between september and december bge customers were relieved of the potential future liability for decommissioning calvert cliffs unit and unit  scheduled to begin no earlier than and  respectively  and are no longer obligated to pay a total of million  in dollars adjusted for inflation  pursuant to the maryland psc order regarding the deregulation of electric generation 
bge will continue to collect the million annual nuclear decommissioning charge from all electric customers through and continue to rebate this amount to residential electric customers  as previously required by maryland senate bill  which was enacted in june bge resumed collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge included in standard offer service sos rates  which had been eliminated under senate bill  on june  through may  without having to rebate it to all residential electric customers 
this totaled million over this period 
starting june   bge has provided all residential electric customers a credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge 
this credit will be given to customers through december  any increase in electric distribution revenue awarded in the first electric distribution rate case filed by bge after the settlement was capped at with certain exceptions 
the agreement does not govern or affect bge ability to recover costs associated with gas rates  federally approved transmission rates and charges  electric riders  tax increases  or increases associated with standard offer service power supply auctions 
effective june   bge implemented revised depreciation rates for regulatory and financial reporting purposes 
the revised rates reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in and million in without impacting distribution rates charged to customers 
effective june   maryland laws governing investments in companies that own and operate regulated gas and electric utilities were amended to make them less restrictive with respect to certain capital stock acquisition transactions 
constellation energy elected two independent directors to the board of directors of bge within the required six months from the execution of the settlement agreement 
base rates base rates are the rates the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them delivery service  plus a profit 
bge has both electric base rates and gas base rates 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time  subject to limitations in the maryland psc october order approving our transaction with edf 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover its utility plant investment and operating costs  plus a profit 
generally  rate increases improve the earnings of our regulated business because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
in may  bge filed an application for an increase in its electric and gas base rates with the maryland psc 
in august  bge updated its application to request an increase of million and million in its electric and gas base rates  respectively 
the request was based upon an rate of return with an return on equity and a equity ratio 
while bge demonstrated the need for a million increase in electric base rates  distribution revenues awarded to bge in the case were subject to a cap pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with the state of maryland as well as the maryland psc order approving the edf transaction 
on december   the maryland psc issued an abbreviated order authorizing bge to increase electric distribution rates by no more than million and increase gas distribution rates by no more than million for service rendered on or after december  the electric distribution rate increase was based upon an rate of return with a return on equity and a equity ratio 
the gas distribution rate increase was based upon a rate of return with a return on equity and a equity ratio 
bge implemented the abbreviated order  will evaluate the comprehensive rate order that the maryland psc will issue in the near future and will assess its alternatives 
bge cannot predict the outcome of this assessment 
revenue decoupling the maryland psc has allowed us to record a monthly adjustment to our electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers since and for the majority of our large commercial and industrial customers since february to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on our electric distribution volumes  thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per customer  by customer class  regardless of changes in consumption levels 
this means bge recognizes revenues at 
table of contents maryland psc approved levels per customer  regardless of what actual distribution volumes were for a billing period 
therefore  while these revenues are affected by customer growth  they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions 
we then bill or credit impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings 
we have a similar revenue decoupling mechanism in our gas business 
demand response and advanced metering programs bge defers costs associated with its demand response programs as a regulatory asset and recovers these costs from customers in future periods 
in august  the maryland psc approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for bge which includes the planned installation of million residential and commercial electric and gas smart meters at an expected total cost of approximately million 
the maryland psc approval ordered bge to defer the associated incremental costs  depreciation and amortization  and an appropriate return  in a regulatory asset until such time as a cost effective advanced metering system is delivered to customers 
under a grant from the united states department of energy doe bge is a recipient of million in federal funding for its smart grid and other related initiatives 
this grant allows bge to be reimbursed for smart grid and other expenditures up to million  substantially reducing the total cost of these initiatives 
we discuss bge electric load management programs in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric load management 
we discuss the associated regulatory assets in note to consolidated financial statements 
electric standard offer service bge is obligated by the maryland psc to provide market based standard offer service sos to all of its electric customers who elect not to select a competitive energy supplier 
the sos rates charged recover bge wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee 
the administrative fee includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component 
however  bge is required under the terms of senate bill to provide all residential electric customers a credit for the residential return component of the administrative fee 
this credit will be given to customers through december  currently  bge is involved in a maryland psc proceeding to determine the future  on going structure of the sos administrative fee charged to all sos customers 
gas commodity charge bge charges its gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase 
the price bge charges for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the regulated gas business section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
potential reliability and quality of service standards the state of maryland is considering legislative and regulatory changes that would impose new reliability and quality of service standards on electric and gas companies  as well as penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we cannot at this time predict the final outcome of this process or how such outcome may affect our  or bge  financial results 
federal regulation ferc the ferc has jurisdiction over various aspects of our business  including electric transmission and wholesale natural gas and electricity sales 
bge transmission rates are updated annually based on a formula methodology approved by ferc 
the rates also include transmission investment incentives approved by ferc in a number of orders covering various new transmission investment projects since we believe that ferc continued commitment to fair and efficient wholesale energy markets should continue to result in improvements to competitive markets across various regions 
since  operation of bge transmission system has been under the authority of pjm interconnection pjm  the regional transmission organization rto for the mid atlantic region  pursuant to ferc oversight 
as the transmission operator  pjm administers the energy markets and conducts day to day operations of the bulk power system 
the liability of transmission owners  including bge  and power generators is limited to those damages caused by the gross negligence of such entities 
in addition to pjm  rtos exist in other regions of the country such as the midwest  new york  texas  and new england 
similar to pjm  these rtos also administer the energy market for their region and are responsible for operation of the transmission system and transmission system reliability 
our generation and newenergy businesses participate in these regional energy markets 
these markets are continuing to develop  and revisions to market structure are subject to review and approval by ferc 
we cannot predict the outcome of any reviews at this time 
however  changes to the structure of these markets could have a material effect on our financial results 
ferc initiatives ongoing initiatives at ferc have included a review of its methodology for the granting of market based rate authority to sellers of electricity 
ferc has established interim tests that it uses to determine the extent to which companies may have market power in certain regions 
where ferc finds that market power exists  it may require companies to implement measures to mitigate the market power in order to maintain market based rate authority 
we believe that our entities selling wholesale power continue to satisfy ferc test for determining whether to grant a public utility market based rate authority 
in november  ferc eliminated through and out transmission rates between the midwest independent system operator miso and pjm and put in place seams elimination charge cost adjustment assignment seca transition rates  which are paid by the transmission customers of miso and 
table of contents pjm and allocated among the various transmission owners in pjm and miso 
the seca transition rates were in effect from december  through march  ferc set for hearing the various compliance filings that established the level of the seca rates and has indicated that the seca rates are being recovered from the miso and pjm transmission customers subject to refund by the miso and pjm transmission owners 
we are a recipient of seca payments  payer of seca charges  and supplier to whom such charges may be shifted 
administrative hearings regarding the seca charges concluded in may  and an initial decision from the ferc administrative law judge alj was issued in august the decision of the alj generally found in favor of reducing the overall seca liability 
in may  ferc issued an order approving in part and reversing in part the alj decision 
the ferc order results in additional seca liabilities being imposed on us 
in june  we filed a request for rehearing of the ferc order on the alj decision  as did other interested parties 
the rehearing requests are pending at ferc 
in july  bge filed a petition for review of ferc approval of the seca methodology  and this appeal is being held in abeyance pending action by ferc on the pending rehearing requests 
in the interim  pjm and miso have made filings at ferc to comply with the may decision and to impose charges accordingly 
depending on the ultimate outcome  the proceeding may have a material effect on our financial results 
capacity markets in general  capacity market design revisions are routinely proposed and considered on an ongoing basis 
such changes are subject to ferc review and approval 
currently  we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the possible effect on our  or bge  financial results 
through and  pjm made several filings at ferc proposing various revisions to its capacity market  or reliability pricing model rpm  including the determination of the cost of new entry cone  which is an important component in determining the price paid to capacity resources in pjm 
pjm also proposed revisions relating to the participation of energy efficiency and demand resources  and market power and mitigation rules 
some of these matters are still pending at ferc 
while recent rpm design changes have not yet had a material effect on our financial results  we cannot predict the outcome of the issues still pending or on any capacity market design changes that result from new regulatory requirements 
such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
in may  five state public service commissions  including the maryland psc  consumer advocates  and others filed a complaint against pjm at the ferc  alleging that the rpm produced unreasonable prices during the period from june  through may  the complaint requested that ferc establish a refund effective date of june   reject the results of the through rpm capacity auction results  and significantly reduce prices for capacity beginning as of june  through ferc dismissed the complaint and denied rehearing  and ultimately the maryland psc and new jersey board of public utilities appealed the case to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
in february  the court denied the petition for review and held that ferc adequately explained why the rpm auction structure was just and reasonable 
the petitioners could seek to appeal the court decision to the united states supreme court 
we cannot predict at this time whether the petitioners will seek an appeal or the outcome of any further proceedings 
in april  the attorney general of connecticut  the connecticut department of public utilities and office of consumer counsel together  the connecticut parties filed complaints at ferc alleging improper energy bidding behavior since december  by generators located in new york that also received capacity payments within iso new england 
in may  the connecticut parties filed an amended complaint asserting that constellation energy commodities group  inc ccg and others received capacity payments while never intending to perform as capacity resources 
the revised allegations assert that certain generators engaged in economic withholding by submitting energy bids at or near the offer cap 
since december  ccg has received approximately million in payments for capacity offered into iso new england associated with constellation energy previously wholly owned nuclear facilities located in ny 
in august  ferc issued an order setting this matter for a public hearing before an alj to determine the intent of the capacity suppliers including ccg in making their energy offers in iso new england 
ccg actively participated in the proceeding  and in september the alj issued an initial decision finding that the connecticut parties failed to prove their case and dismissed the complaint against ccg 
the initial decision is pending before ferc for approval or modification 
three major  high voltage transmission lines have been announced that could enhance significantly the transfer capacity of the pjm transmission system from west to east 
the siting process  both in the states and at ferc  is uncertain  as is the likelihood that one or more of the transmission lines will be ultimately constructed 
the construction of the transmission lines  which could depress both capacity and energy prices for generation located in maryland and elsewhere in the eastern part of pjm  could have a material effect on our financial results 
in addition to legal challenges to capacity markets and regulatory advocacy before ferc seeking to revise the capacity market structures  states are seeking more direct ways to affect the results of wholesale capacity markets 
in january  the new jersey legislature adopted legislation that would provide for guaranteed cost recovery for the development of up to  mws of new base load or mid merit generation in exchange for the requirement that the new generation clear in the pjm capacity market 
similarly  the maryland psc issued a draft request for proposals that  subject to an evidentiary hearing confirming the reliability need for such resources  contemplates having maryland ratepayers fund the development of new generation and to require that eligible new generation clear in the pjm capacity market 
such state efforts are intended to 
table of contents depress capacity prices  and are subject to legal and regulatory challenge 
depending on the outcome of these challenges  these state efforts could have a material effect on our financial results 
nerc reliability standards in compliance with the energy policy act of  ferc has approved the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as the national energy reliability organization 
nerc will be responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability and cyber security standards for the wholesale electric power system 
we are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate 
nerc will have the ability to assess financial penalties for noncompliance  which could be material 
concerns over the security of the country energy infrastructure could lead to additional future rules or regulations related to the operation and security requirements of our generating facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution systems  which could have a material impact on our operations and financial results 
financial regulatory reform the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was enacted in july while the dodd frank act is focused primarily on the regulation and oversight of financial institutions  it also provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives  including mandatory clearing of certain swaps  exchange trading  margin requirements  and other transparency requirements 
the dodd frank act  however  also preserves the ability of end users in our industry to hedge their risks  which we believe results in the new derivatives requirements not being applicable to us for most of our activities 
however  there will be several key rulemakings to implement the derivatives requirements  which  depending on the final scope of the regulations  could attempt to impose significant obligations on us nonetheless 
final regulations may address collateral requirements and exchange margin cash postings  which if applicable to us despite being an end user of derivatives  could have the effect of increasing collateral requirements or the amount of exchange margin cash postings in lieu of letters of credit currently issued on over the counter contracts 
these regulations could also result in additional transactional and compliance costs to the extent they apply to us  and could impact market liquidity 
in addition to new regulation over derivatives  the dodd frank act amends the sarbanes oxley act to permanently exempt nonaccelerated filers  including bge  from the requirement to obtain an audit report on internal controls over financial reporting 
market oversight regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction over our businesses  including the ferc and commodity future trading commission cftc  possess broad enforcement and investigative authority to ensure well functioning markets and to prohibit market manipulation or violations of the agencies rules or orders 
these agencies also possess significant civil penalty authority  including in the case of ferc and the cftc  the authority to impose a penalty of up to million per day per violation 
we are committed to a culture of compliance and ensuring compliance with all applicable rules  laws and orders 
nonetheless  the regulatory agencies engage in either public or non public investigations in response to allegations of wrongdoing and we may be involved in certain market activities that become subject to investigations 
even where no wrongdoing is found  the process of participating in a regulatory investigation could have a material effect on our business 
weather generation and newenergy businesses weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our generation and newenergy businesses 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity  natural gas  and fuels 
changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market  which may affect our results in any given period 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time  thus we are not typically exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of our business at once 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather affects residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
the maryland psc has approved revenue decoupling mechanisms which allow bge to record monthly adjustments to the majority of our regulated electric and gas business distribution revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns 
we discuss this further in the regulation maryland revenue decoupling  regulated electric business revenue decoupling and regulated gas business revenue decoupling sections 
other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our newenergy business 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  implementation of new market rules governing operations of regional power pools  
table of contents procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and international supply and demand 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  state and local environmental regulations  local transportation systems  and the nature and extent of electricity competition 
other factors also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downturn  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental matters and legal proceedings we discuss details of our environmental matters in note to consolidated financial statements and item business environmental matters section 
we discuss details of our legal proceedings in note to consolidated financial statements 
some of this information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss  our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent critical accounting policies as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities we utilize a variety of derivative instruments in order to manage commodity price risk  interest rate risk  and foreign currency risk 
because of the extensive nature of the accounting requirements that govern both accounting treatment and documentation  as well as the complexity of the transactions within the scope of these requirements  management is required to exercise judgment in several areas  including the following identification of derivatives  selection of accounting treatment for derivatives  valuation of derivatives  and impact of uncertainty 
as discussed in more detail below  the exercise of management judgment in these areas materially impacts our financial statements 
while we believe we have appropriate controls in place to apply the derivative accounting requirements  failure to meet these requirements  even inadvertently  could require the use of a different accounting treatment for the affected transactions 
in addition  interpretations of these accounting requirements continue to evolve  and future changes in accounting requirements also could affect our financial statements materially 
we discuss derivatives and hedging activities in more detail in note and note to consolidated financial statements 
identification of derivatives we must evaluate new and existing transactions and agreements to determine whether they are derivatives or if they contain embedded derivatives 
identifying derivatives requires us to exercise judgment in interpreting the definition of a derivative and applying that definition to each individual contract 
if a contract is not a derivative  we cannot apply derivative accounting  and we generally must record the effects of the contract in our financial statements upon delivery or settlement under the accrual method of accounting 
in contrast  if a contract is a derivative  we must apply derivative accounting  
table of contents which provides for several possible accounting treatments as discussed more fully under accounting treatment below 
as a result  the required accounting treatment and its impact on our financial statements can vary substantially depending upon whether a contract is a derivative or a non derivative 
accounting treatment we are permitted several possible accounting treatments for derivatives that meet all of the applicable requirements 
mark to market is the default accounting treatment for all derivatives unless they qualify  and we affirmatively designate them  for one of the other accounting treatments 
derivatives designated for any of the other elective accounting treatments must meet specific  restrictive criteria  both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis 
the permissible accounting treatments for derivatives are mark to market  cash flow hedge  fair value hedge  and accrual accounting under normal purchase normal sale npns 
each of the accounting treatments that we use for derivatives affects our financial statements in substantially different ways as summarized below recognition and measurement accounting treatment balance sheet income statement mark to market derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value changes in fair value recognized in earnings cash flow hedge derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value effective changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ineffective changes in fair value recognized in earnings amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings or becomes probable of not occurring fair value hedge derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value book value of hedged asset or liability adjusted for changes in its fair value changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of hedged asset or liability recognized in earnings npns accrual fair value not recorded accounts receivable or accounts payable recorded when derivative settles changes in fair value not recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed we exercise judgment in determining which derivatives qualify for a particular accounting treatment  including cash flow and fair value hedges determination that all hedge accounting requirements are satisfied  including the expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value from the risk being hedged and  for cash flow hedges  the probability that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur 
accrual accounting under npns determination that the derivative will result in gross physical delivery of the underlying commodity and will not settle on a net basis 
we also exercise judgment in selecting the accounting treatment that we believe provides the most transparent presentation of the economics of the underlying transactions 
although contracts may be eligible for hedge accounting or npns designation  we are not required to designate and account for all such contracts identically 
we generally elect npns accrual or hedge accounting for our physical energy delivery activities because accrual accounting more closely aligns the timing of earnings recognition  cash flows  and the underlying business activities 
by contrast  we generally apply mark to market accounting for risk management and trading activities because changes in fair value more closely reflect the economic performance of the activity 
however  we also use mark to market accounting for the following activities our competitive retail gas customer supply activities and our fixed quantity competitive retail power customer supply activities for new transactions closed after june   which are managed using economic hedges that we have not designated as cash flow hedges so as to match the timing of recognition of the earnings impacts of those activities to the greatest extent permissible  economic hedges of activities that require accrual accounting for which the related hedge requires mark to market accounting  and interest rate swaps related to our debt if they do not qualify as fair value hedges 

table of contents as a result of making these judgments  the selection of accounting treatments for derivatives has a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
these impacts affect several components of our financial statements  including assets  liabilities  and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
additionally  the selection of accounting treatment also affects the amount and timing of the recognition of earnings 
the following table summarizes these impacts accounting treatment effect of changes in fair value on mark to market cash flow hedge fair value hedge npns assets and liabilities increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives decrease or increase in hedged asset or liability no impact aoci no impact increase or decrease for effective portion of hedge no impact no impact earnings prior to settlement increase or decrease increase or decrease for ineffective portion of hedge increase or decrease for change in derivatives decrease or increase for change in hedged asset or liability increase or decrease for ineffective portion no impact earnings at settlement no impact amounts in aoci reclassified to earnings when hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings or when the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring hedged margin recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed valuation we record mark to market and hedge derivatives at fair value  which represents an exit price for the asset or liability from the perspective of a market participant 
an exit price is the price at which a market participant could sell an asset or transfer a liability to an unrelated party 
while some of our derivatives relate to commodities or instruments for which quoted market prices are available from external sources  many other commodities and related contracts are not actively traded 
additionally  some contracts include quantities and other factors that vary over time 
in these cases  we must use modeling techniques to estimate expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both in order to determine fair value 
the prices  quantities  and other factors we use to determine fair value reflect management best estimates of inputs a market participant would consider 
we record valuation adjustments to reflect uncertainties associated with estimates inherent in the determination of fair value that are not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates we use to determine fair value 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the uncertainties for which we record valuation adjustments and determining the level of such adjustments and changes in those levels 
we discuss fair value measurements in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the judgments we are required to make in order to estimate fair value have a material impact on our financial statements 
these judgments affect the selection  appropriateness  and application of modeling techniques  the methods used to identify or estimate inputs to the modeling techniques  and the consistency in applying these techniques over time and across types of derivative instruments 
changes in one or more of these judgments could have a material impact on the valuation of derivatives and  as a result  could also have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
impacts of uncertainty the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities involves significant judgment and requires the use of estimates that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported amounts of revenues and costs and could be affected by many factors including  but not limited to  the following uncertainty surrounding inputs to the estimates of fair value due to factors such as illiquid markets or the absence of observable market price information  our ability to continue to designate and qualify derivative contracts for npns accounting or hedge accounting  
table of contents potential volatility in earnings from ineffectiveness on derivatives for which we have elected hedge accounting  and our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value long lived assets we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or legislature or an adverse change in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets classified as held for sale  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value less costs to sell 
for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use  we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
this necessarily requires us to estimate uncertain future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to estimate the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
the estimation of fair value also involves judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
unproved gas properties we evaluate unproved property at least annually to determine if it is impaired 
impairment for unproved property occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling  the lease is near its expiration  or historical experience necessitates a valuation allowance 
the determination of whether to continue to develop the lease is based upon the economics forward prices and the level of gas reserves associated with extracting the estimated gas reserves  which necessarily involves the exercise of judgment 
investments we evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  ceng  une through november   and partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded is whether the investment has experienced an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of investment impairments involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment  we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value 
we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of our equity method investments that own coal  hydroelectric  fuel processing projects  as well as our equity investment in our nuclear joint venture 
these issues include environmental and legislative initiatives 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired 
california statutes and regulations require load serving entities to increase their procurement of renewable energy 
table of contents resources and mandate statewide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
given the need for electric power and the statutory and regulatory requirements increasing demand for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to foster an environment that supports the use of renewable energy and continues certain subsidies that will make renewable energy projects economical 
however  should california legislation and regulatory policies and federal energy policies fail to adequately support renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired  and any losses recognized could be material 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the business might be impaired 
goodwill is impaired if the carrying value of the business exceeds fair value 
annually  we estimate the fair value of the businesses we have acquired using techniques similar to those used to estimate future cash flows for long lived assets as discussed on the previous page  which involves judgment 
if the estimated fair value of the business is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is greater than its fair value

the impairment losses and other costs and workforce reduction costs line items for also include amounts related to the operations we divested 
generation business background our generation business is discussed in detail in item business operating segments section 
we have presented the results of this business reflecting that we have hedged of generation output and fuel for generation 
this is based on executing hedges at prevailing market prices with the newenergy business 
taking into account previously executed hedges at the end of each fiscal year  we ensure that the generation business is fully hedged by the newenergy business for the next year 
therefore  all commodity price risk is managed by and presented in the results of our newenergy business as discussed below 
generally  changes in the results of our generation business during the period are due to changes in the availability of the generating assets 
during  power prices continued to decline  reflecting economic conditions and projected increases in natural gas supplies 
however  prices for coal have not declined to the same extent as power prices 
the relationship between power and fuel prices directly affects the earnings of our generation business 
although our newenergy business hedges portions of our future power sales and fuel purchases  the amounts we have hedged are higher for the near term and decline over time 
we have already locked in prices for our expected generation output for however  consistent with our hedging approach  we have only hedged a portion of the expected output for  and those hedges are at lower prices 
if the current power and fuel price environment continues  we anticipate that our generation business will have lower earnings in future years  especially in additionally  we evaluated our generating plants for impairment as a result of power price declines in although none of our plants were impaired  further decreases in power prices could result in estimated future cash flows declining below the carrying value of our plants  which would require us to record an impairment charge

we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities create fluctuations in mark to market earnings 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the risk management section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market results are changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates  counterparty creditworthiness  the number and size of our open derivative positions  and the number  size  and profitability of new transactions  including termination or restructuring of existing contracts 
during and  we focused our activities on reducing capital requirements  reducing long term economic risk  and reducing short and interim term liquidity requirements 
these actions may impact the future results of the newenergy business  particularly the size of and potential for changes in fair value of activities subject to mark to market accounting 
the primary components of mark to market results are origination gains and gains and losses from risk management and trading activities 
origination gains arise primarily from contracts that our newenergy business structures to meet the risk management needs of our customers or relate to our trading activities 
transactions that result in origination gains may be unique and provide the potential for individually significant revenues and gains from a single transaction 
risk management and trading mark to market represents both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our portfolio  including the effects of changes in valuation adjustments 
in addition to our fundamental risk management and trading activities  we also use non trading derivative contracts subject to mark to market accounting to manage our exposure to changes in market prices  while in general the underlying physical transactions related to these activities are accounted for on an accrual basis 
we discuss the changes in mark to market results below 
we show the relationship between our mark to market results and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later in this section 

table of contents mark to market results were as follows in millions unrealized mark to market results origination gains risk management and trading mark to market unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management and trading mark to market total unrealized mark to market realized mark to market total mark to market results total unrealized mark to market is the sum of origination transactions and total risk management and trading mark to market

total mark to market results increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of due to unrealized changes in fair value primarily due to million of higher results on open positions primarily due to the absence of losses in our power and transmission risk management activities in the pjm  midwest  new york  and west regions as a result of a favorable price environment in and completion of our activities to reduce risk and improve liquidity  million of higher gains on open positions primarily due to the absence of losses in resulting from a more favorable price environment related to our retail power and gas businesses  million of higher results in our domestic coal portfolio primarily due to a more favorable price movement  and million of higher results on open positions due to a more favorable price environment related to economic hedges of our upstream gas operations and risk management activities 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of million in results from our international coal and freight operations  which we divested in total mark to market results decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of the period to period variance in unrealized changes in fair value was due to decreased unrealized risk management and trading results of million and the decrease in origination gains of million 
we discuss the decrease in origination gains below 
the decrease in risk management and trading results of million was primarily due to million of lower results in our domestic coal portfolio primarily as a result of less favorable price movements relating to economic hedges which substantially decreased in value as coal prices decreased in  million due to the absence of gains in our international coal and freight operation as a result of its divestiture in march  million of lower gains in our wholesale natural gas risk management and trading operation primarily as a result of the divestiture of our natural gas trading operation in the beginning of april  and million of lower results related to our emissions trading activities primarily as a result of a less favorable price environment 
these decreases were partially offset by the following million of higher results on open positions primarily due to the absence of losses in our power and transmission risk management activities primarily in the pjm  northeast  and new york regions as a result of a more favorable price environment in and our activities to reduce risk and improve liquidity  and million of lower losses in our retail gas portfolio primarily due to a more favorable price environment in we did not record any origination gains during and during  our newenergy business amended certain nonderivative contracts to mitigate counterparty performance risk under the existing contracts 
as a result of these amendments  the revised contracts became derivatives subject to mark to market accounting 
the change in accounting for these contracts from nonderivative to derivative resulted in substantially all of the origination gains for presented in the unrealized mark to market results table above 
the recognition of origination gains is generally dependent on sufficient available market data that validates the initial fair value of the contract 
liquidity and market conditions impact our ability to identify sufficient  objective market price information to permit recognition of origination gains 
as a result  the level of origination gains we are able to recognize may vary from year to year as a result of the number  size  and market price transparency of the individual transactions executed in any period

the decrease of million in our net derivative liability subject to hedge accounting since december  was due to million of realization of out of the money cash flow hedges at the time the forecasted transaction occurred  partially offset by million of increases on our out of the money cash flow hedge positions primarily related to decreases in power  natural gas  and coal prices during the following are the primary sources of the change in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded in earnings origination gains unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options contracts acquired dedesignated contracts and other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting that affected earnings were as follows origination gains represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules 
unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to more accurately reflect the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net derivative asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than in our consolidated statements of income loss changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are recorded in accounts receivable rather than derivative assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these 
table of contents amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net derivative asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net derivative asset 
contracts acquired represents the initial fair value of acquired derivative contracts recorded in derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
substantially all of this activity for related to the divestiture of our international commodities operation  houston based gas trading operation  and certain other trading operations in order to transfer risk and reward to the buyers 
dedesignated contracts and other changes in fair value include transfers of derivative contracts from cash flow hedges to mark to market treatment  transfers of derivative contracts from mark to market treatment to cash flow hedges  and those derivative contracts that did not meet the qualifications of cash flow hedge accounting 
during  substantially all of the activity related to dedesignations were in connection with the strategic objective of restructuring and reducing the risk of our portfolio 
the settlement terms of the portion of our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting and sources of fair value based on the fair value hierarchy are as follows as of december  settlement term thereafter fair value in millions level level level total net derivative asset liability subject to mark to market accounting management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets varies substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  many contracts are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily offset in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the preceding table 
however  based upon the nature of our newenergy business  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
generally  we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
operating expenses our newenergy business operating expenses decreased million during as compared to due to lower labor and benefit costs of million  primarily due to lower headcount resulting from the divestitures in  and lower non labor operating expenses of million  part of which represents the absence of costs from the divestitures completed in

base rates on december   the maryland psc issued an abbreviated order authorizing bge to increase electric distribution rates by million for service rendered on or after december  this increase was based upon an rate of return with a return on equity and a equity ratio 
we discuss bge electric base rates in the regulation maryland base rates section 
residential customer rate credit on october   the maryland psc issued an order approving constellation energy transaction with edf 
among other things  the order required constellation energy to fund a one time distribution rate credit for bge residential customers before the end of march totaling million  or approximately per customer  for which bge recorded a liability in november in december  bge filed a tariff with the maryland psc stating bge would give residential customers a rate credit of exactly per customer 
as a result  bge accrued an additional million for a total fourth quarter accrual of million 
the portion of this total credit allocated to residential electric customers was million pre tax 
this credit was accrued in the fourth quarter of and applied to bge residential electric customer bills in the first quarter of nuclear decommissioning charges effective january   bge and calvert cliffs nuclear power plant inc calvert cliffs mutually agreed to terminate the decommissioning funds collection agent agreement  which was effective from july  to december  as a result  bge ceased transferring funds to provide for the decommissioning of calvert cliffs unit and unit calvert cliffs retains the obligation to provide adequate assurances of funding pursuant to nuclear regulatory commission requirements 
under the maryland settlement agreement  bge will continue to provide certain credits to residential customers and assess certain charges to all customers relating to decommissioning 
smart energy savers program sm surcharge beginning in  the maryland psc approved customer surcharges through which bge recovers costs associated with certain programs designed to help bge manage peak demand and encourage customer energy conservation through the use of customer bill credits 
revenues declined in compared to  primarily due to an increase in customer involvement in our programs 
this increased participation increased customer credits and  therefore  decreased revenues

the estimated settlement of million was accrued in the second quarter of and a total of million was credited to customers in the third and fourth quarters of 
table of contents revenue decoupling the maryland psc has allowed us to record a monthly adjustment to our electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers since and for the majority of our large commercial and industrial customers since february to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on our electric distribution volumes  thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per customer  by customer class  regardless of changes in consumption levels 
this means bge recognizes revenues at maryland psc approved levels per customer  regardless of what actual distribution volumes were for a billing period 
therefore  while these revenues are affected by customer growth  they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions 
we then bill or credit impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings 
standard offer service bge provides standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative supplier

senate bill credits as a result of senate bill  beginning january   we were required to provide to residential electric customers a credit equal to the amount collected from all bge electric customers for the decommissioning of our calvert cliffs nuclear power plant and to suspend collection of the residential return component of the administrative charge collected through residential sos rates through may  under an order issued by the maryland psc in may  as of june   we were required to reinstate collection of the residential return component of the administration charge in rates and to provide all residential electric customers a credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge 
under the maryland settlement agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  bge was allowed to resume collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge from june  through may  without having to rebate it to residential customers 
the decrease in revenues during compared to is primarily due to the reinstatement of the credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge on june  and higher distribution volumes

the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
customers who do not purchase gas from bge are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
however  these customers are charged base rates to recover the costs bge incurs to deliver their gas through our distribution system  and are included in the gas distribution volume revenues

there was no such activity in contract and portfolio acquisitions during and  our newenergy business acquired several pre existing energy purchase and sale agreements  which generated significant cash flows at the inception of the contracts 
these agreements had contract prices that differed from market prices at closing  which resulted in cash payments to or from the counterparty at the acquisition of the contract 
we paid net cash of million in to acquire various contracts 
during 
table of contents  we received net cash of million due to the execution of total return swaps to assist in the execution of our divestitures of our international commodities and houston based gas trading operations 
we reflect the underlying contracts on a gross basis as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets depending on whether they were above or below market prices at closing  therefore  we have also reflected them on a gross basis in cash flows from investing and financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows as follows year ended december  in millions financing activities proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions investing activities contract and portfolio acquisitions cash flows from contract and portfolio acquisitions we record the proceeds we receive to acquire energy purchase and sale agreements as a financing cash inflow because it constitutes a prepayment for a portion of the market price of energy  which we will buy or sell over the term of the agreements and does not represent a cash inflow from current period operating activities 
for those acquired contracts that are derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract with the counterparties as financing cash inflows 
for those acquired contracts that are not derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract as operating cash flows 
we discuss certain of these contract and portfolio acquisitions in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
cash flow impacts ceng joint venture prior to november   we recorded of the revenues  expenses  and cash flows from ceng and the nuclear plants it owns because we wholly owned this entity 
on november   we completed the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf  and we deconsolidated ceng 
accordingly  for periods after november   we ceased recording ceng cash flows and began to record cash flows from our ppa and other transactions with ceng 
we will record any future cash flows from distributions received from ceng based on our ownership interest  and we may be required to make capital contributions to help fund ceng capital program 
as a result of deconsolidation  our generation business cash flows differed from historical cash flows primarily due to the following factors we now sell between of the output of ceng plants  excluding output sold by ceng directly to third parties  rather than of the plants total output including volumes contracted to third parties 
fuel and purchased energy expenses reflect our purchases of the output of ceng plants  excluding output sold directly to third parties  as provided under the terms of the ppa with ceng 
we discuss the terms  and subsequent amended terms  of the ppa in note to consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses no longer include ceng plant operating costs or general and administrative expenses 
we no longer incur cash flows for of ceng capital expenditures or the acquisition of nuclear fuel  but we are required to make capital contributions to help ceng fund these expenditures 
we will record cash distributions from ceng if and when such distributions are declared 
we did not receive any distributions from ceng in in addition  we entered into a power services agency agreement psa and an administrative service agreement asa with ceng 
the psa is a five year agreement under which we will provide scheduling  asset management and billing services to ceng and will recognize average annual revenue of approximately million 
the asa is a one year agreement that is renewable annually under which we provided administrative support services to ceng for a fee of approximately million for the level of fees for administrative support services will be subject to change in future years based on the level of services provided 
the charges under these agreements are intended to represent the actual cost of the services provided to ceng from us 
in october  we entered into a comprehensive agreement with edf 
among other provisions of the agreement  the asa was extended through we discuss the comprehensive agreement with edf in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
impact of security ratings on our liquidity we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows 
independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy and bge fixed income securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost us to sell securities and  in certain cases  our ability to access capital markets to sell securities 
generally  the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to us when we sell them 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy and bge credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  business risk profile  stock price volatility  political  legislative  and regulatory risk  interest charges relative to operating cash flows and the level of debt relative to total capitalization 

table of contents at the date of this report  the senior unsecured debt and commercial paper credit ratings for constellation energy and bge were as follows standard poor rating group moody investors service fitch ratings constellation energy senior unsecured debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f bge senior unsecured debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f the constellation energy and bge ratings in the above table reflect stable outlooks by all the credit rating agencies  except that moody rating of bge reflects a positive outlook 
if any of these credit ratings were to be downgraded  especially below investment grade  our ability to raise capital on favorable terms  including in the commercial paper markets  if available  could be hindered  and our borrowing costs would increase 
additionally  the business prospects of our wholesale and retail competitive supply businesses  which in many cases rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy  would be negatively impacted 
in this regard  we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require us to post additional collateral upon a credit rating downgrade 
we discuss the potential effect of a ratings downgrade in the collateral section 
we discuss the potential effect of a ratings downgrade on our ability to maintain ongoing compliance with financial ratios in our existing credit agreements in note to consolidated financial statements 
as a condition to the october maryland psc order approving our transaction with edf  constellation energy and bge were required to implement ring fencing measures to provide bankruptcy protection and credit rating separation of bge from constellation energy 
we completed the implementation of these measures in february we remain committed to maintaining a stable investment grade credit profile and to meeting our liquidity requirements 
we discuss our available sources of funding in more detail below 
available sources of funding in addition to cash generated from operations  we rely upon access to capital for our capital expenditure programs and for the liquidity required to operate and support our commercial businesses 
our liquidity requirements are funded by credit facilities and cash 
we fund our short term working capital needs with existing cash and with our credit facilities  many of which support direct cash borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper 
we also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters of credit  primarily for our newenergy business 
the primary drivers of our use of liquidity have been our capital expenditure requirements and collateral requirements associated with hedging our generating assets and hedging our newenergy business in both power and gas 
significant changes in the prices of commodities  depending on hedging strategies we have employed  could require us to post additional letters of credit  and thereby reduce the overall amount available under our credit facilities or to post additional cash  thereby reducing our available cash balance 
additional regulation of the derivatives markets could also require us to post additional cash collateral 
we discuss the financial reform legislation enacted in in more detail in the federal regulation section 
we discuss our  and bge  credit facilities in detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
net available liquidity constellation energy excluding bge and bge net available liquidity at december  was billion and billion  respectively 
we discuss net available liquidity in more detail in the note to consolidated financial statements 
collateral constellation energy collateral requirements generally arise from its newenergy business as a result of its participation in certain organized markets  such as independent system operators isos or financial exchanges  as well as from our margining on over the counter otc contracts 
to support newenergy wholesale and retail power obligations and our limited trading activities  constellation energy posts collateral to isos 
forward hedging of our generation and newenergy businesses creates the need to transact with exchanges such as new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange 
we post initial margin based on exchange rules  as well as variation margin related to the change in value of the net open position with the exchange 
in addition to the collateral posted to isos and exchanges  we post collateral with certain otc counterparties 
these collateral amounts may be fixed or may vary with price levels 
there are certain inherent asymmetries relating to the use of collateral that create liquidity requirements for our generation and newenergy businesses 
these asymmetries arise from our actions to be economically hedged  as well as market conditions or conventions for conducting business that result in some transactions being collateralized while others are not  including in our newenergy business  we generally do not receive collateral under contractual obligations to supply power or gas to our customers but we hedge these transactions through purchases of power and gas that generally require us to post collateral 
by entering into a gas supply agreement with the buyer of our gas trading operation  we have reduced our collateral requirements to support our retail gas operation 
we discuss this gas supply agreement in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
we also intend to further align our load obligations by buying generation assets in regions where we do not have a significant generation presence and entering into longer tenor agreements with merchant generators  further reducing our dependence on exchange traded products  thereby 
table of contents lowering our collateral requirements 
during  we acquired generation assets in texas  and in january  we acquired generation assets in massachusetts  which will assist with reducing our collateral requirements 
in our generation business  we may have to post collateral on our power sale or fuel purchase contracts 
finally  collateral types may asymmetrically impact our liquidity 
in margining with otc counterparties  we may post letter of credit lc collateral for an out of the money counterparty 
however  we may receive lc collateral when we are in the money with a counterparty 
posting lcs reduces our liquidity while the receipt of lc collateral does not increase our liquidity 
customers of our newenergy business rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
in this regard  we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require us to post additional collateral upon a credit rating downgrade in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
based on contractual provisions at december   we estimate that if constellation energy senior unsecured debt were downgraded to one level below the investment grade threshold we would have the following additional collateral obligations credit ratings downgraded to level below current rating additional obligations in billions below investment grade if there are split ratings among the independent credit rating agencies  the lowest credit rating is used to determine our incremental collateral obligations 
includes billion related to derivative contracts as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of a downgrade  we could be required to post additional collateral in an amount that could exceed the obligation amounts specified above  which could be material 
we discuss our credit facilities in the available sources of funding section 
in addition  rulemaking under the dodd frank act could impose additional collateral requirements 
we discuss this rulemaking in the federal regulation section 
capital resources our actual consolidated capital requirements for the years through  along with the estimated annual amount for  are shown in the following table 
we will continue to have cash requirements for working capital needs  payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  capital expenditures  and the retirement of debt 
capital requirements for and include estimates of spending for existing and anticipated projects 
we continuously review and modify those estimates 
actual requirements may vary from the estimates included in the table below because of a number of factors including regulation  legislation  and competition  bge load requirements  environmental protection standards  the type and number of projects selected for construction or acquisition  the effect of economic and market conditions on those projects  the cost and availability of capital  potential capital contributions to ceng  the availability of cash from operations  and business decisions to invest in capital projects 
our estimates are also subject to additional factors 
please see the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
estimate in billions generation and other capital requirements major environmental maintenance growth total generation and other capital requirements newenergy capital requirements maintenance growth total newenergy capital requirements regulated capital requirements electric gas distribution electric transmission smart energy savers sm initiatives total regulated capital requirements total capital requirements eligible capital projects are shown net of anticipated investment tax credits or grants 
as of the date of this report  we estimate our capital requirements will be approximately billion 
capital requirements generation and newenergy businesses our generation and newenergy businesses capital requirements consist of its continuing requirements  including expenditures for maintenance and uprates to the capacity of our generating plants  solar projects and upstream natural gas properties  
table of contents costs of complying with the environmental protection agency epa  maryland  and various other states environmental regulations and legislation  and enhancements to our information technology infrastructure 
in addition  in january  we completed the acquisition of boston generating  mw fleet of generating plants for approximately billion  subject to a working capital adjustment 
we funded this acquisition through a mix of available cash and debt 
in december  we were selected by the state of maryland to construct  own  operate and maintain a mw solar photovoltaic power installation in emmitsburg  maryland 
we expect this project to cost us approximately million and be completed by december renewable electricity produced by the system will be purchased by the state of maryland at the site of mount st 
mary university under a year solar power purchase agreement 
in  we acquired the mw criterion wind project to be constructed in garrett county  maryland 
we closed this transaction in the first quarter of and we placed it in service in the fourth quarter of regulated electric and gas regulated electric and gas construction expenditures primarily include new business construction needs and improvements to existing facilities  including projects to improve reliability and support demand response and conservation initiatives 
further  bge continues to invest in transmission projects that earn a ferc authorized rate of return 
in august  the maryland psc approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for bge which includes the planned installation of million residential and commercial electric and gas smart meters at an expected total cost of approximately million 
in  the united states department of energy doe selected bge as a recipient of million in federal funding for our smart grid and other related initiatives 
this grant allows bge to be reimbursed for smart grid and other expenditures up to million  substantially reducing the total cost of these initiatives 
funding for capital requirements generation and newenergy businesses we expect to fund the capital requirements of our generation and newenergy businesses with internally generated cash and other available sources 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the money markets  capital markets and lease markets  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from draw downs on credit facilities 
the projects that our generation and newenergy businesses develop typically require substantial capital investment 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest in as well as our upstream properties are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project 
regulated electric and gas we expect to fund capital expenditures associated with our regulated electric and gas businesses through a combination of internally and externally generated cash 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the short term and long term capital markets including trust preferred securities or preference stock  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from draw downs on credit facilities 
bge may also receive equity contributions from time to time from constellation energy 
contractual payment obligations and committed amounts we enter into various agreements that result in contractual payment obligations in connection with our business activities 
these obligations primarily relate to our financing arrangements such as long term debt  preference stock  and operating leases  purchases of capacity and energy to support our generation and newenergy business activities  and purchases of fuel and transportation to satisfy the fuel requirements of our power generating facilities 
we detail our contractual payment obligations as of december  in the following table payments thereafter total in millions contractual payment obligations long term debt nonregulated principal interest total bge principal interest total bge preference stock operating leases operating leases  gross sublease rentals operating leases  net purchase obligations purchased capacity and energy purchased energy from ceng fuel and transportation other other noncurrent liabilities uncertain tax positions liability pension benefits postretirement and post employment benefits total contractual payment obligations amounts in long term debt reflect the original maturity date 
investors may require us to repay million early through remarketing features 
interest on variable rate debt is included based on forward curve for interest rates 
our operating lease commitments include future payment obligations under certain power purchase agreements as discussed further in note to consolidated financial statements 
contracts to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
amounts related to certain purchase obligations are based on future purchase expectations which may differ from actual purchases 
our contractual obligations for purchased capacity and energy are shown on a gross basis for certain transactions  including both the fixed payment portions of tolling contracts and estimated variable payments under unit contingent power purchase agreements 
as part of reaching a comprehensive agreement with edf in october  we modified our existing power purchase agreement with ceng to be unit contingent through the end of its original term in additionally  beginning in and continuing to the end of the life of the respective plants  we agreed to purchase of the available output of ceng nuclear plants at market prices 
we have included in the table our commitments under this agreement for five years  the time period for which we have more reliable data 
further  we continue to own a membership interest in ceng that we account for as an equity method investment 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for more details on this agreement 
amounts related to pension benefits reflect our current year forecast for contributions for our qualified pension plans and participant payments for our nonqualified pension plans 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for more detail on our pension plans 
amounts related to postretirement and postemployment benefits are for unfunded plans and reflect present value amounts consistent with the determination of the related liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements for financing and other business purposes  we utilize certain off balance sheet arrangements that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
such arrangements do not represent a significant part of our activities or a significant ongoing source of financing 
we use these arrangements when they enable us to obtain financing or execute commercial transactions on favorable terms 
as of december   we have no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees with third parties that are subject to initial recognition and measurement requirements  retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such asset  derivative instruments indexed to our common stock  and classified as equity  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services 
at december   constellation energy had a total face amount of billion in guarantees outstanding  of which billion related to our newenergy business 
these amounts generally do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent parental guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations to third parties in order to allow our subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post other forms of collateral 
our estimated net exposure for obligations under commercial transactions covered by these guarantees was approximately billion at december   which represents the total amount the parent company could be required to fund based on december  market prices 
for those guarantees related to our derivative liabilities  the fair value of the obligation is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe it is unlikely that we would be required to perform or incur any losses associated with guarantees of our subsidiaries obligations 
we discuss our other guarantees in note to consolidated financial statements and our significant variable interests in note to consolidated financial statements 
risk management introduction risk is inherent in our business activities 
constellation energy is exposed to market  credit  operational  and liquidity risks that are fundamental to our business of providing products and services across the energy value chain 
additionally  our businesses are subject to business and strategic risks  the risks of unsuccessful business performance due to changing economic conditions  competition  regulatory environment  legislation  economic conditions  market liquidity  country or sovereign issues  systems or process failure  and fiscal and monetary policies 
these risks exist in our business with varying levels of exposure  and are interrelated and cannot be managed in isolation 
the company risk management framework and governance structure are intended to provide appropriate controls and ongoing management of the major risks in our business activities 
the risk management framework is also intended to create a culture of risk awareness and personal accountability for risk taking across the company 
as a result of the extent and diversity of the risks the company faces in its business operations  we analyze risk and risk concentration at transaction  portfolio  business  and enterprise wide levels to ensure that material risks are identified and managed effectively 
we utilize numerous methods to evaluate and measure risks 
in general  we evaluate risks in terms of the impact on our economic value  earnings  liquidity  strategic objectives  credit rating  reputation  and values 
we identify and evaluate risks based not only on their probability of occurring and magnitude of impact on the financial statements  but also with respect to the potential for significant or unexpected shifts in market conditions or rules 
we recognize the importance of managing risk as a key differentiator in the energy business and view the active and effective management of the risks in our businesses to be of paramount importance 
our risk management program is based on established policies and procedures to manage risks  combined with an extensive system of internal controls 
nevertheless  no system of risk management can cost effectively eliminate all risks to which an entity is exposed 
thus  in particular environments  the company may not be able to mitigate risk exposures to the level desired and may have exposures to certain risk factors that cannot be mitigated 
in this section  we will review the company risk practices in terms of our risk governance  risk functions  and risk exposures 
risk governance our board of directors is responsible for risk oversight of company activities 
the board of directors has approved the company risk appetite statement and has authorized management to establish risk policies and limits consistent with this statement 
the audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews compliance with our risk policies and limits and the effectiveness of the related internal controls 
the compensation committee of the board of directors is responsible for oversight of the impact of compensation policies on risk taking 
management has established the risk appetite statement in the context of the market environment and the company business strategy 
in setting the risk appetite  the company takes into consideration factors such as market volatility  product liquidity  business trends  and management experience 
the company risk management committee rmc is responsible for approving risk management policies and limits consistent with the risk appetite statement  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement  and 
table of contents management of risks  and monitoring risk exposures 
the rmc meets on a regular basis and is chaired by our chief executive officer 
other committee members are our chief risk officer  chief financial officer  vice chairman  general counsel  chief human resources officer  head of corporate strategy and development  head of corporate affairs  public  and environmental policy and business unit leaders 
in addition  the chief risk officer coordinates with the risk management committees in the business units that meet regularly to identify  assess  and quantify material risk issues and to develop strategies to manage these risks 
business managers are responsible for managing risks within the established risk appetite  while the risk management group rmg is responsible for enforcing compliance with risk management policies and risk limits 
the rmg reports to the chief risk officer  who is a member of the company management committee and who reports to the chief executive officer and the board of directors 
the chief risk officer provides regular risk management updates to the audit committee and the board of directors 
in an effort to manage risks  constellation energy has established a series of limits at the corporate and business unit level that reflect the company risk appetite 
business units are responsible for adhering to established limits  against which exposures are monitored and reported 
limit breaches are reported in a timely manner to senior management  who consults with the business unit on an appropriate course of action 
risk functions risks are managed at the individual and portfolio level of exposure in each business relative to the company risk appetite in aggregate and across all major risk types 
constellation energy rmg is an independent function tasked with providing an independent quantification and assessment of key business risks  as well as providing an evaluation of individual risk components that contribute to the company consolidated risk profile 
the rmg is also responsible for establishing risk policies  maintaining appropriate risk controls  ensuring compliance with policies and procedures  and monitoring methods according to the risk parameters established by the board of directors 
the rmg consists of seven divisions that focus on a specialized area of risk 
credit risk management credit risk management is responsible for managing the risk of loss inherent in the business units stemming from counterparty or customer failures and adverse market events that effect counterparty creditworthiness 
this group supports the business units by establishing credit relationships with various wholesale counterparties and retail customers and facilitating market liquidity with credit limits and appropriate contractual credit terms and conditions 
credit risk managers are responsible for managing credit risk associated with our business activities  including establishing limits and contractual structures  as well as establishing and enforcing credit policies 
market risk management market risk management is responsible for effectively identifying  quantifying  monitoring  and reporting on impacts of market risk  to include price volatility  correlations  volume uncertainty  market liquidity  interest rate and currency exposure on company businesses 
the market risk group also enforces the market risk policies and ensures compliance with these policies  including the monitoring  analyzing  and escalating of market risk controls 
this group also develops market risk measurement tools  such as stress and scenario tests  gross margin at risk  and assists the businesses in implementing market strategies with the highest benefits 
collateral and funding liquidity risk management collateral risk management is responsible for providing an integrated view on credit  market  and company liquidity risks to facilitate treasury management of the company collateral and overall liquidity position 
funding liquidity risk is the risk that we may be unable to fund our obligations in some future period 
this group responsibilities include measuring and monitoring collateral flows  downgrade collateral needs  and collateral use across the company 
additionally  this group forecasts expected collateral and liquidity requirements as well as estimates potential collateral requirements due to market shifts  hedging strategies  and adjustments to the company credit ratings 
finally  collateral risk management assists the businesses in determining the strategic use of collateral and the appropriate cost of collateral for transactions 
the group also works closely with the treasury function to plan for expected and contingent liquidity needs based on the company long term business plan 
operational risk management operational risk is the risk associated with human error  a failure of process and systems or external factors 
rmg staff oversee implementation of a common framework for defining  measuring  monitoring  and reporting operational risks 
the integrated risk assessment process involves capturing risk and controls holistically 
accountability for the identification of risks in our business processes resides with business management  who must ensure the completeness and effectiveness of controls and level of residual risk 
corporate audit corporate audit assists in ensuring that controls put in place by management to mitigate the risks of the business are adequate and functioning appropriately 
this group supports the risk assessment process including the analysis of inherent and residual risk  performs risk based audits as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors  and supports the improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of key business processes 
special situations group our special situations group is comprised of two departments receivables management and credit workout 
receivables management seeks to maximize cash flows from collection efforts 
table of contents for the company business units 
its primary function is to mitigate risk by focusing efforts on all aspects of the accounts receivable process including fees related to early termination of energy supply contracts 
credit workout is responsible for the management of distressed customers 
these include counterparties in bankruptcy and contractual default 
credit workout also seeks to generate cash flows by negotiating early settlement on potential losses and through the sale of impaired assets in the secondary market 
deal review  risk analytics and risk capital our deal review team performs independent reviews of structured transactions and develops standardized risk adjusted metrics for assessing these transactions 
our risk analytics team provides quantitative support to all risk functions  builds key risk models and metrics  and conducts independent validation of models used by the company 
our risk capital team is responsible for the development and implementation of a framework for the measurement of capital adequacy  risk based transaction pricing and risk adjusted performance measurement of our business segments and portfolios 
risk capital  or economic capital  is the level of capital required to offset the effect of unexpected specified stress on the economic value of the company 
it is an assessment of the underlying market  credit  operational  and liquidity risks of the company business activities  utilizing internal risk assessment methodologies 
risk exposures we manage risks across all of our businesses 
we summarize below the risks we manage within each of our businesses 
generation and newenergy businesses our generation and newenergy businesses are exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact our financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  potential imbalances in supply and demand  credit risk and operational risk 
regulated electric business bge does not own or operate any electric generating facilities 
therefore  bge regulated electric business is exposed to market price risk 
to mitigate this  bge obtains energy and capacity to provide sos through a competitive bidding process approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss sos and the impact on base rates in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business section 
as a result of this process  bge exposure to market price risk is limited  and at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated electric business was not material 
however  bge may enter into electric futures  options  and swaps to hedge its market price risk if appropriate 
we discuss this further in note to consolidated financial statements 
bge regulated electric business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 
regulated gas business bge acquires all of its natural gas for delivery to customers from third party suppliers 
therefore  bge regulated gas business is exposed to market price risk 
however  bge recovers the costs of purchased gas under the market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
additionally  bge may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program as appropriate 
we discuss this further in note to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
bge regulated gas business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 
risk exposure categories the various categories of risk exposures that we manage include  but are not limited to  market risk  which includes interest rate risk  security price risk  and foreign currency risk  credit risk  which includes wholesale and retail credit risk  operational risk and collateral and funding liquidity risk 
as previously noted  these risks may be common to more than one of our businesses 
we discuss each of these primary risk exposure categories separately below 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of power  natural gas  coal  and other related commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and operation of power plants  our retail and wholesale customer supply operations  and our origination  risk management  and trading activities 
these commodity price risks arise from changes in market volatilities or correlations  and changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and products in our generation and newenergy businesses  and if we do not hedge the associated financial exposure  this commodity price volatility could adversely affect our economic value or earnings 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical power system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of coal  oil  and natural gas 

table of contents these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical power and gas systems  and the nature and extent of power market restructuring 
additionally  we have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or in the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile  and the price that can be obtained from electricity sales may not change at the same rate or in the same direction as changes in fuel costs 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  historical price relationships  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting  and such variations could be material 
power  gas  coal  and other related commodity trading risks involve the potential decline in net income or financial condition due to adverse changes in market prices  whether arising from customer activities  generating plants  or proprietary positions taken by the company 
we assess and monitor market risk with a variety of tools  including evar  var  scenario analysis  and stress testing 
evar evar measures the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of the generation and newenergy businesses due to changes in market risk factors 
evar is a one day value at risk measure calculated at a confidence level assuming a standard normal distribution of prices over the most recent rolling month period 
evar includes all positions over a forward rolling month time horizon that expose us to market price risk  regardless of business line 
positions included in evar are comprised of mark to market and nonderivative accrual positions that create market risk including derivative and nonderivative commodity contracts associated with our generation and newenergy businesses  physical assets  such as our owned and contractually controlled generating plants  our share of investments in generating plants  and our share of investments in upstream natural gas properties 
we include the positions related to physical assets to provide a more complete presentation of our commodity market risk exposures 
evar includes illiquid products and positions for which there is limited price discovery 
modeling the positions in our generation and newenergy businesses involves a number of assumptions  and includes projections of generation  emission rates and costs  customer load growth  load response to weather  and customer response to competitive supply 
changes in our forecast or management estimates will affect the fair value of these positions in a manner not captured by evar 
evar reflects the risk of loss due to market prices under normal market conditions 
an inherent limitation of our value at risk measures is the reliance on historical prices 
a sudden shift in market conditions can cause the future behavior of market prices to differ materially from the past 
we use stress tests and scenario analysis to better understand extreme events as a complement to evar 
this includes exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets  sensitivity to changes in management projections of customer demand or forecasted generation output  and price sensitivity to illiquid points and regional basis spreads 
evar is monitored daily and is subject to regional and overall guidelines for the newenergy business 
we place guidelines on the risk associated with illiquid delivery locations and regional basis within our newenergy business 
additionally  we monitor generation plant hedge ratios relative to guidelines specified by management 
stress tests and scenario analysis are conducted regularly and the results  trends  and explanations are reviewed by senior management and risk committees 
the evar amounts below represent the potential pre tax change in the fair values of our generation and newenergy businesses positions over a one day holding period 
evar for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low at december   our evar was approximately million  which represents a decline from its level of million on december   mainly due to lower price levels and lower volatilities as well as a decrease in our ownership of nuclear generation as a result of our sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf 
var var measures the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of mark to market energy contracts due to changes in market risk factors 
var is calculated assuming a standard normal distribution of prices over the most recent rolling month period 
var includes all positions subject to mark to market accounting  including not only contracts that hedge the economics of newenergy nonderivative power and fuel contracts and which do not receive hedge accounting treatment  but also contracts designated for trading 
thus  the positions for which we monitor var are included within  and are not incremental  to the positions subject to evar 
var and evar have similar limitations 
var may include some products and positions for which there is limited price discovery or market depth 
the modeling of option positions 
table of contents included in var involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
an inherent limitation of our var measures is the reliance on historical prices 
a sudden shift in market conditions can cause the future behavior of market prices to differ materially from that of the past 
the var amounts below represent the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of our newenergy business positions subject to mark to market accounting  including both trading and non trading activities  over one and ten day holding periods 
total mark to market var for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  ten day holding period year end average high low constellation energy proprietary trading activities are substantially reduced from previous years and remain immaterial 
these activities continue to be managed with daily var limits  stop loss limits and position limits 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain related interest rate swaps 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
as of december   we have interest rate swaps relating to million of our long term debt 
these fair value hedges effectively convert our current fixed rate debt to a floating rate instrument tied to the three month london inter bank offered rate libor 
including the million in interest rate swaps  approximately of our long term debt is floating rate 
during january  as part of retiring the remainder of our notes  we terminated million of interest rate swaps 
during february  we entered into million of interest rate swaps related to fixed rate long term debt  effectively converting the debt to a floating rate instrument tied to libor 
of these swaps  million qualify for and have been designated as fair value hedges and million do not qualify as fair value hedges and will be marked to market through earnings 
we discuss our use of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  to manage our interest rate risk in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate a fixed rate debt average interest rate a interest on variable rate debt is included based on the forward curve for interest rates at december  
table of contents security price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in financial markets primarily through our pension plan assets 
in  our actual gain on pension plan assets was million 
we describe our pension funding requirements in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk our generation and newenergy businesses are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this foreign currency risk arises from our activities in countries where we transact in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our exposure to foreign currency risk was not material 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk using a foreign currency hedging program 
we will continue to have limited exposure to the canadian dollar due to our canadian gas and power operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk through our generation and newenergy businesses and bge operations 
credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparties nonperformance and retail customer accounts receivable and forward value payment risk arising from contracted power and gas supply agreements 
we evaluate our credit risk as discussed below 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative transactions both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our newenergy business through credit policies and procedures  which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and the use of master netting agreements 
as of december   our total exposure across our entire wholesale portfolio is billion  net of collateral  and includes accrual positions and derivatives 
this total exposure has declined from the billion as of december   primarily driven by a change in commodity prices and the decrease in our exposure to ceng throughout the top ten counterparties account for of our total exposure with none of that exposure being non investment grade 
we consider a significant concentration of credit risk to be any single obligor or counterparty whose concentration exceeds of total credit exposure 
at december   two counterparties  a large power cooperative and ceng  comprised a total exposure concentration of 
as of december  and  counterparties in our newenergy credit portfolio had the following public credit ratings  shown as a percentage of the total portfolio exposure at december  rating investment grade non investment grade not rated includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
our exposure to not rated counterparties was billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease was mostly driven by a reduction in our ceng credit exposure  which is not externally rated 
many of our not rated counterparties including ceng are considered investment grade equivalent based on our internal credit ratings 
we utilize internal credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers  including those companies that do not have public credit ratings 
based on internal credit ratings  approximately billion or of the exposure to not rated counterparties was rated investment grade equivalent at december  and approximately billion or was rated investment grade equivalent at december  the following table provides the breakdown of the credit quality of our wholesale credit portfolio based on our internal credit ratings 
this includes those counterparties which are externally rated and those in the not rated category as a percentage of the total portfolio exposure 
at december  investment grade equivalent non investment grade equivalent if a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations and we were to liquidate transactions with that entity  our potential credit loss would include all forward and settlement exposure plus any additional costs related to termination and replacement of the positions 
this would include contracts accounted for using the mark to market  hedge  and accrual accounting methods  the amount owed or due from settled transactions  less any collateral held from the counterparty 
in addition  if a counterparty were to default under an accrual contract that is currently favorable to us  we may recognize a material adverse impact on our results in the future delivery period to the extent that we are required to replace the contract that is in default with another contract at current market prices 
these potential losses would be limited to the extent that the in the money amount exceeded any credit mitigants such as cash  letters of credit  or parental guarantees supporting the counterparty obligation 
to reduce our credit risk 
table of contents with counterparties  we attempt to enter into agreements that allow us to obtain collateral on a contingent basis  seek third party guarantees of the counterparty obligation  and enter into netting agreements that allow us to offset receivables and payables with forward exposure across many transactions 
due to volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the power we had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
we also enter into various wholesale transactions through isos 
these isos are exposed to counterparty credit risks 
any losses relating to counterparty defaults impacting the isos are allocated to and borne by all other market participants in the iso 
these isos have established credit policies and practices to mitigate the exposure of counterparty credit risks 
as a market participant  we continuously assess our exposure to the credit risks of each iso 
bge is exposed to wholesale credit risk of its suppliers for electricity and gas to serve its retail customers 
bge may receive performance assurance collateral to mitigate electricity suppliers credit risks in certain circumstances 
performance assurance collateral is designed to protect bge potential exposure over the term of the supply contracts and will fluctuate to reflect changes in market prices 
in addition to the collateral provisions  there are supplier step up provisions  where other suppliers can step in if the early termination of a full requirements service agreement with a supplier should occur  as well as specific mechanisms for bge to otherwise replace defaulted supplier contracts 
all costs incurred by bge to replace the supply contract are to be recovered from the defaulting supplier or from customers through rates 
retail credit risk we are exposed to retail credit risk through our newenergy electricity and natural gas supply activities  which serve commercial and industrial companies and governmental entities  and through bge electricity and natural gas distribution operations 
retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations or fail to pay for service rendered 
this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances  as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve customers of our nonregulated retail businesses 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit approval policies  monitoring customer exposures  and the use of credit mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
in addition  we have taken steps to augment our credit staff in response to current economic conditions 
in accordance with our credit policy we do not have a significant exposure concentration with any one customer  geographic area or industry 
retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
however  we have organized a dedicated credit workout function whose job is to work with distressed customers and recover receivables owed to the company 
this also involves negotiating early termination settlements and selling impaired assets in the secondary market 
bge is subject to retail credit risk associated with both the delivery portion of a customer bill as well as the uncollectible expense or credit risk from the gas and or electric commodity portion of the bills of those customers to whom bge sells the gas and electric commodity 
bge is also exposed to credit risk associated with the timing of the collection of receivables from those customers who have contracted with a third party supplier where bge has purchased that supplier receivables 
although both bge delivery and commodity rates include some level of costs for uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses  full recovery is contingent on amounts approved by the maryland psc in customer rates and  therefore is not guaranteed and bge is exposed to these potential losses and related carrying costs 
operational risk operational risk is the risk associated with human error or a failure of process and systems  or external factors  as well as the risk of operating owned and contractually controlled generating assets  electric transmission and distribution systems  and gas distribution systems 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including fraud by employees  clerical and record keeping errors  and unauthorized data access 
additionally  our asset operations can be effected by those events that are partially or wholly out of our control  like natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and computer application viruses  which may cause losses in generation or service to customers resulting in revenue loss 
we own  have ownership interests in  and operate power generation facilities  which use a diverse mix of fuels including fossil fuels  nuclear and biomass 
we are also exposed to variations in the prices for  and required volumes of  natural gas  oil  and coal required to fuel our power plants that generate electricity 
therefore  high commodity prices increase the impact of generator outages and variable load  but as long as the electricity and fuel prices move in tandem  we have limited exposure to changing commodity prices 
during periods of high demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may be insufficient and could require us to procure additional fuel at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may exceed our needs  and could result in us selling the excess 
these scenarios could potentially lead to a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we are exposed to risk on both sides of the distribution chain  from fuel to end customer delivery  due to inability to produce energy 
if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sales commitments through the operation of other more 
table of contents costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our electricity supplies may exceed our customers needs and potentially result in selling excess energy at lower prices 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
collateral and funding liquidity risk funding liquidity risk relates to the ability to fund current and future obligations of the company given variability in collateral requirements as well as variability around working capital requirements and other cash flows that may affect our liquidity 
to assess funding liquidity risk  we distinguish between sources and uses of liquidity 
sources of liquidity include projected net available cash and the unused capacity available from our credit facilities 
uses include expected and contingent collateral requirements as well as any unexpected variation of cash flows from projected levels 
we define contingent requirements to be any incremental or decremental requirements to expected requirement levels 
to manage liquidity risk  we quantify sources of liquidity and the expected and contingent uses of liquidity both over a short term and long term horizon 
contingent uses of liquidity are determined by stress testing our portfolio using a simulation of extreme  adverse price stresses and measuring their combined impact on collateral needs and on cash flows related to losses due to market and credit risk 
liquidity stresses related to operational risks weather  plant outages and other business risks not directly linked to price moves are assessed on a regular basis using scenario analysis 
results of the liquidity assessment are shared regularly with senior management 
liquidity risk assessment has been integrated into our strategic planning process 
expected and contingent funding needs implied by the business plans of our various business units are first aggregated and compared to available liquidity sources over the planning horizon 
capital and liquidity sources are then allocated to business units based on their business plans  taking into account the cost of providing liquidity 
we believe that this integrated view on sources and uses of liquidity allows us to ensure proper funding of the business in accordance with our business plan
