item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units in three business segments as determined in accordance with fasb asc topic  segment reporting 
our in vitro diagnostics segment also called iris diagnostics division idd  designs  manufactures and markets systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis 
table of contents and body fluids 
our personalized medicine segment combines the research and development operations of our iris molecular diagnostics and arista molecular  inc subsidiaries 
under this new segment we consolidate all operations for the development and commercialization of cancer diagnostic testing services and related products 
our sample processing segment markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing  as well as  equipment for fluorescent in situ hybridization fish 
iris diagnostics division our core business is in the urinalysis market and we are the leading worldwide provider of automated urine microscopy systems  with more than  iq microscopy analyzers shipped to date in over countries 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of instruments  consumables and service 
revenues from instruments include global sales of urine microscopy analyzers and sales of chemistry analyzers 
in september  we released our proprietary ichemvelocity automated urine chemistry analyzer and a fully integrated urine microscopy and urine chemistry work cell  called the iricell in some international markets 
we plan to commence selling the ichemvelocity and iricell in the united states contingent upon attaining clearance from the us food and drug administration fda on our k application 
historically we sold our family of iq analyzers integrated with an automated chemistry analyzer  the aution max ax  which we have sourced from a japanese manufacturer 
our consumables offering includes products such as chemical reagents  urine test strips  calibrators and controls 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranty  and spare parts purchased by international customers 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue should continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
in the united states  france  germany  the united kingdom and puerto rico sales of our urinalysis systems are direct to the end user through our sales force 
all other international sales are through independent distributors 
in january  we completed the purchase from certain european distributors of assets relating to the distribution of products in the united kingdom  ireland and germany 
the purchased assets consisted primarily of installed instruments leased to customers and the related lease agreements and service contracts 
our incremental revenue relating to the acquired distributors businesses was million for the year ended december  international sales represented of consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and since the majority of international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products  but we incur minimal sales and marketing costs for such sales 
personalized medicine on july   we acquired arista molecular  a high complexity clia certified molecular pathology laboratory offering differentiated  high value molecular diagnostic services in the rapidly growing field of personalized medicine 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement dated july   we acquired all the issued and outstanding stock for an amount in cash equal to million less certain indebtedness existing at the closing  with an additional earn out of up to million subject to the achievement of specific sales and earnings targets through december we did not assume any outstanding options or warrants in connection with the acquisition 
arista will operate under the personalized medicine reporting segment of the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of acquisition  arista molecular was an early stage laboratory with limited commercial operations 
in  we focused the laboratory s efforts to broaden its menu of diagnostic panels useful for the diagnosis  disease characterization  treatment and monitoring of cancer 
we added testing for breast and prostate solid tumors beyond the existing lung and colorectal offering 
in addition  we now offer flow cytometry for detection and monitoring of leukemia and lymphoma and fish testing 
further  we are building the commercial infrastructure of the laboratory by adding sales and marketing personnel 
as a result  results included the dilutive impact from arista of million  or approximately per share with negligible revenue 
with the expansion of the test menu and sales force  we expect the revenue contribution from this segment to become more meaningful in  but continue to have a dilutive impact for the year 

table of contents sample processing our iris sample processing group markets and develops centrifuges  semi automated dna processing workstations and sample processing consumables 
our statspin brand bench top centrifuges are used for specimen preparation in coagulation  cytology  chemistry and urinalysis 
our worldwide markets include medical institutions  commercial laboratories  clinics  doctors offices  veterinary laboratories and research facilities 
our sample processing products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors and incorporated into our oem partners products 
on november   we acquired the assets of a multi purpose  bench top instrument platform for automating highly repetitive  manual laboratory protocols for fish fluorescence in situ hybridization testing and other slide based cytogenetic applications 
the product acquisition is a natural extension to the successful thermobrite dna hybridization system and in line with our entry into personalized medicine with emphasis on cancer diagnostics 
the product prototypes and proprietary technology assets were purchased for million in cash from biomicro systems  inc although biomicro systems built and tested a working prototype  which proved the technical feasibility of the base technology  several elements of this technology platform requires continued development in order to reach salability for its stated purpose 
once development is completed  a useful life will be determined and the assets will be amortized over the useful life determined at that time 
research and development we have invested significant capital to acquire technologies and to increase our investment in research and development both to sustain our technological leadership in our existing core product lines in urinalysis and sample processing and as part of our growth strategy to broaden our product pipeline into new high value platforms in hematology and molecular diagnostics 
the decision to diversify into ivd market segments in which we do not presently participate has adversely affected our earnings growth over the last four years  as we have invested significantly in research and development without any corresponding revenues from new products still in development 
our investment in new product platforms  however  is of strategic importance and is necessary to position the company for significant revenue and earnings acceleration in future years 
research and development expense increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in of these expenditures  approximately million and million was invested in and  respectively  in our nadia and hematology platforms 
for  we anticipate that research and development expense will be approximately of revenue 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of income critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
table of contents values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition idd and sample processing revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met i an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  ii customer credit worthiness has been established  and iii delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic revenue recognition  which generally require revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if sold separately 
multiple elements of certain domestic product sales include ivd instruments  training  consumables and service 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sales type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as investment in sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized when collectability of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as i those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  ii those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest  and iii those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
revenue recognition personalized medicine revenues related to our personalized medicine segment are recorded in accordance with fasb asc s  revenue recognition  when i the price is fixed or determinable  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the service is performed and iv collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form and revenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed  the results have been delivered to the ordering physician  the payor has been identified and eligibility and insurance have been verified 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including medicare  commercial insurance companies  other directly billed healthcare institutions such as hospitals and clinics  and individuals 
we report revenues from contracted payors  including medicare  certain insurance companies and certain healthcare institutions  based on the contractual rate  or in the case of medicare  published fee schedules 
for non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and individuals  we report revenues based on the amount which we expect to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at the reported revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the 
table of contents historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
goodwill and intangible assets our intangible assets consist of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as a clia license  which are not being amortized and intangible assets with a finite life  which are being amortized over useful lives ranging from to years 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated in accordance with fasb asc topic  the intangibles goodwill and other  based on various analyses  including a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value and discounted cash flow 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
intangible assets with a finite life are evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to a potential impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with asc topic substantially all of the goodwill resides in the personalized medicine reporting unit 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with fasb asc topic  software 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods of up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosures required 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value

comparison of year ended december  to consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased over the prior year to million from million in international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue in compared to in revenues in the idd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
the current year idd revenues include approximately million incremental revenue related to the acquisition of european distributor operations earlier in the year 
sales of idd instruments increased to million from million in the prior year 
the continued increase in idd instrument sales is primarily driven by strong domestic sales versus a year ago period due to new marketing and sales initiatives and improvement in the us medical capital equipment market environment 
idd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments both domestically and internationally and 
table of contents increased sales of ichemvelocity test strips due to increased placements of our ichemvelocity analyzer in the international market 
revenues derived from sample processing instruments and supplies modestly increased to million  a increase over revenues of million 
revenues were favorably impacted by the following factors a continued strong sales of our thermobrite line of instruments  b introduction of our new cytofuge instrument and c ovatube consumables 
revenues were unfavorably impacted by the completion of the transition of the separator consumable business to idexx 
we will receive royalties on these units beginning in personalized medicine revenues in totaled  consolidated gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in  primarily the result of higher cost of goods due to a price premium on our final purchase of automated chemistry analyzers from arkray  the negative effect of foreign currency fluctuations  and increased service costs relating to our start up of direct commercial operations in europe 
the gross profit margin of our idd instruments was in compared to in instrument gross margins were impacted by increased costs from foreign sourced products due to the weakening of the us dollar  in particular on our purchases of aution max ax chemistry analyzers which are denominated in japanese yen  partially offset by higher instrument volume and a greater mix of direct domestic sales versus international sales through distributors 
the gross profit margin of our idd consumables and service decreased to in compared to in  primarily the result of increased costs of foreign sourced products due to the weaker us dollar  increased service costs related to ichemvelocity and an increase in service costs related to our direct commercial operations in the united kingdom and germany  partially offset by the higher margins due to manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher volume in consumables sold 
gross profit margin for our sample processing instruments and supplies segment increased to in from in as a result of product mix  favorable purchase price discounts  and cost reduction initiatives such as lean manufacturing 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase primarily results from million of expenses related to arista s operations  additional personnel and related costs of million related primarily to our direct operations in the united kingdom and germany  travel and entertainment  excluding uk and germany of  as well as higher commissions and gpo fees of general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in  from million or of revenues in this increase primarily relates to million in acquisition and operating expenses relating to arista   of cfo severance and related transition expenses   of additional personnel and related costs in information technology  quality assurance and regulatory affairs and  of recruiting and relocation expenses 
research and development expense increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in the increase was primarily attributable to million in research materials  consulting  clinical development expenses  million in personnel and related costs and other expenses of approximately  as we continue to invest heavily in research and development for the continued development of our diagnostics product pipeline  including our nadia platform and gems urinalysis and hematology programs 
interest income during amounted to million  a  increase over mainly due to a higher cash balance through part of as well as an increase in in house sales type leases 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the decrease in the income tax provision resulted from an increase in research and development tax credits due to an increase in qualifying research and development expenses 
we have federal and state research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million 

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  decreased by over the prior year to million from million in international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue for both and revenues in the idd urinalysis segment decreased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of idd instruments decreased to million from million in the prior year as a result of a significant shortage of capital in the global markets 
sales of idd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting expiring warranty agreements to service agreements 
revenues derived from sample processing instruments and supplies increased to million  a increase over revenues of million 
this growth was driven by continued strong sales of our new express centrifuge along with an increase in orders from our international distributors  most notably our distributor in the united kingdom 
overall gross profit margins increased to in compared to in the gross profit margin of our idd instruments was in versus in as compared to the prior year period  idd instrument gross margin in was impacted by  in sales promotions   in costs related to the ichemvelocity  which included velocity retrofit costs of  volume and other costs of  severance costs of approximately  with an offset of a reduction in employee bonuses of  in addition  our gross margins on idd instruments were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations on our purchases of aution max ax chemistry analyzers which are denominated in japanese yen 
the gross margin of our idd consumables and service increased to during compared to in  respectively  and included  in international sales discounts 
the consumable gross margin improvement primarily resulted from economies of scale generated by our increasing volume of urine microscopy consumables and spare parts  improved efficiencies in our domestic service business  a reduction in unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of dry chemistry strips denominated in japanese yen and a reduction of employee bonuses of  gross profit margin for our sample processing instruments and supplies segment increased to in from in as a result of product mix  price increases and reduced headcount related to the reduction in force in the second quarter of in addition  the gross margin was affected by our sample processing division s voluntarily recall of approximately  centrifuges  requiring a  accrual to cover the product retrofit costs during the fourth quarter of marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes personnel and related costs of  partially offset by lower commission and gpo fees of  travel and entertainment of  a reduction of employee bonuses of  and professional fees of  our  increase in personnel and related costs includes  in start up expenses relating to the initiation of direct sales in the united kingdom and germany

table of contents and gems urinalysis and hematology programs 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in employee bonuses of  interest income during amounted to  a  decrease over mainly due to a lower interest rate environment on our cash balances  and in spite of a higher cash balance 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the decrease in the income tax provision resulted from an increase in research and development tax credits 
at december  we had federal and state research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our idd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million compared to million at december  in the past few years  we have faced adverse macro economic forces  which have impacted our selling markets and the credit markets of our customers 
at this point the impact from these forces are relatively mild  but in the future we may face the following challenges deferrals of purchases due to decreases in capital budgets of our customers  delays in the purchasing cycle due to greater scrutiny of deals and increased internal competition for limited capital dollars  and a significant increase in requests for quotes for operating leases 
the aforementioned factors may lead to a decrease in revenue  an increase of deferred revenue  or could lead to installment cash collection 
operating cash flows 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million  which included net income of million  a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in operating liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million 
cash provided by operations was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in investment in sales type leases of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable remained at days at the end of compared to the prior year end 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable varies and extends due to extended payment terms for our international customers and the granting of an increased volume of extended payment terms for certain customers of our instrument sales and instrument  consumables and service mix 

table of contents our cash flow has been favorably affected by tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and million  respectively 
we continue to realize tax deductions from the exercise of certain stock options 
during the year ended december   we realized tax deductions of approximately  relating to this item 
during the year ended december   we paid federal and state taxes of million and  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in primarily as the result of the acquisition of arista of million  an increase in the purchase of assets from a european distributor of million  an acquisition of product technology totaling million  an increase in the purchase of property and equipment of million and an increase in software development costs capitalized of million 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities totaled million in  which was related primarily to repurchase of common stock 
we currently have a credit facility with a commercial bank consisting of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
the credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the new credit facility 
we are subject to certain financial and non financial covenants under the credit facility with the bank and as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase and retirement plan of up to million of the company s common stock over a month period 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of approximately  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
in  our board of directors authorized two stock repurchase plans  which resulted in our purchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for approximately million during  and an additional  shares of our common stock for approximately million during we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility with the bank will be sufficient to fund normal operations for the foreseeable future 
however  additional funding may be required to fund expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu  business combinations disclosure of supplementary pro forma information  which specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the adoption of the asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which amends asc topic  receivables 
asu requires disclosures about the nature of the credit risk in an entity s financing receivables  how that risk is incorporated into the allowance for credit losses  and the reasons for any changes in the allowance 
disclosure is required to be disaggregated  primarily at the level at which an entity calculates its allowance for credit losses 
asu is applicable to both private and public companies  and will affect any entity that has financing receivables on its balance sheet  not including short term trade accounts receivable 
public entities must apply the disclosure requirements applicable to period end balances beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  december  for a calendar year end entity 
the adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements but did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  now codified under fasb asc topic  software 
asu  removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the adoption of the asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends asc topic  revenue recognition  to require companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  earlier application is permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
this update provides amendments to asc topic intangibles  goodwill and other that requires an entity to perform step impairment test even if a reporting unit has zero or negative carrying amount 
step tests whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
previously reporting units with zero or negative carrying value passed step because the fair value was generally greater than zero 
step requires impairment testing and impairment valuation be calculated in between annual tests if an event or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired 
asu is effective beginning january  as a result of this standard  goodwill impairments may be reported sooner than under current practice 
we do not expect asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not invest in derivatives  foreign currency forward contracts or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we had no debt at december   thus were not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on debt obligations 
we are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on our short term investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in certificates of deposit and the market value of these investments fluctuate based on changes in interest rates 
foreign currencies we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the european union and asia 
our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we are also subject to certain foreign currency risks in the importation of goods from japan and as a result of commercial operations in europe and asia 
our purchases from a major japanese ivd supplier are denominated in japanese yen 
these components represent a significant portion of our material costs  but our yen exposure should decrease with the discontinuation of japanese sourced instruments beginning in january all of our sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of france and germany  where sales are denominated in euros and the united kingdom  where sales are denominated in british pounds 
fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for japanese yen and euros could result in increased costs for our key components and increased costs for commercial operations in europe 
to mitigate the potential impact of adverse fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for these currencies  we have periodically purchased foreign currency forward contracts in the past for euros and japanese yen 
during the years ended december  and  we did not enter into any such contracts  and no such contracts existed at december
