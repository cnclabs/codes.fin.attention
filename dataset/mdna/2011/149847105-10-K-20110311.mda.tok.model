item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such disclosure covers certain risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
we undertake no obligation to correct or update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents item business overview we provide managed information technology  or it  and communications services to our target market of small businesses  who generally have between and employees 
our services include voice services  broadband internet access  mobile voice and data  email  voicemail  web hosting  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  virtual private network  desktop security  hosted microsoft exchange  mobile workforce management  virtual receptionist  and other it and communications services 
our recent acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements have expanded our it services into cloud computing with virtual and dedicated cloud servers and cloud private branch exchange or phone systems or pbx 
traditionally  we have sold our services only when included with one of our integrated packages of bundled services or as a la cart services in addition to one of our packages 
however  the cloud based services now offered as a result of these recent acquisitions may be purchased separately from our integrated packages or as part of an integrated package 
our voice services other than our mobile voice and data services are delivered using voice over internet protocol  or voip technology 
all of such services  other than cloud based services purchased outside of an integrated package  are delivered over our secure all internet protocol  or ip  via a high capacity bandwidth connections network  which allows us to control quality of service much better than services delivered over the best efforts public internet 
we utilize various types of high speed connections where available and economically feasible 
our network allows us to manage quality of service and achieve network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional communications networks 
we designate revenues as either core managed services or cloud services 
core managed services revenues arise from our traditional customers located in the metropolitan markets where we deliver integrated packages of managed services  including broadband circuits as part of our service our beyondvoice package 
cloud services revenues arise from services that are delivered separately from broadband circuits 
in future periods we may re designate certain core managed services revenues  such as hosted microsoft exchange  secure desktop  and remote backup and storage  as cloud services revenue for reporting purposes dependent on how we manage delivery of these services 
our it services appeal to small businesses that lack the in house technical expertise and resources to build and manage the capabilities that they need in order to compete effectively in a business environment that increasingly demands a robust and reliable online presence 
we believe that small businesses are becoming more interested in outsourcing many of their it functions to a trusted provider who will host their applications in the cloud 
cloud computing refers to services delivered on demand via the internet and can be available in a secure and cost effective manner 
we provide many of our services in this manner today  in addition to those service offerings resulting from our recent acquisitions 
in the future  we expect to introduce other applications hosted in the cloud 
we believe our all ip network platform enables us to deliver an integrated bundle of highly reliable it and communications services that have typically only been available to large enterprises and may otherwise be too expensive or impractical for our small business customers to obtain 
we manage all aspects of our service offerings for our customers  including installation  provisioning  monitoring  proactive fault management and billing 
we first launched our integrated packages of bundled services in atlanta in april  and now sell them in metropolitan markets  including dallas  denver  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  detroit  the san francisco bay area  miami  minneapolis  the greater washington dc area  seattle and boston 
our recent acquisitions allow us to also serve customers with cloud based services in geographic areas outside of these core markets 
our cloud services customers are located throughout the united states and internationally 
for the year ended december   less than of our consolidated revenue came from customers based outside of the united states 
we reported million in revenue in  as compared to million in and million in we reported million  million and million of adjusted ebitda  a non gaap 
table of contents measure  see non gaap financial measures and net loss income of million  million and million on a consolidated basis  in  and  respectively 
our financial results on a segment basis for reporting and management purposes are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have typically opened anywhere from one to three new markets per year for our integrated service offering 
during  instead of focusing on opening new markets  we will focus on incorporating the newly acquired cloud based services into our integrated service offering  leveraging historic and expanding acquired sales channels  and increasing our product offering to take advantage of the new capabilities available through our acquisitions 
we will also continue our ongoing ethernet conversion project see cost of revenue section in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations being implemented throughout our markets in order to optimize our cost structure and increase bandwidth available through our integrated packages 
we anticipate resuming our geographic market expansion beginning in  depending on economic  regulatory and other conditions 
as of december   and  we were providing core managed service communications services to   and  customer locations  respectively 
these customer locations exclude those served exclusively by our newly established cloud services segment 
we provide each of our integrated packages of managed services at a competitively priced  fixed monthly fee 
certain enhanced services are available as optional add ons at either flat monthly rates or on a usage basis 
we also earn revenues for usage exceeding quantities included within the package or purchased through additional services  including long distance  mobile  conferencing and calling card minutes  mobile text messages and bandwidth used for data services 
we believe that we provide a differentiated value proposition to our customers  most of which do not have dedicated in house resources to fully address their it and communications requirements and who therefore value the ease of use and comprehensive management that we offer 
our primary competitors  the local telephone companies  do not generally offer packages of similar managed services to our target market 
we believe that this value proposition  along with our fixed length contracts  has been crucial to achieving a relatively stable customer churn rate  which averaged approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  we believe that our expansion of cloud based services will continue to strengthen our value proposition 
we employ a single integrated network  which uses technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converges them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
this is unlike traditional voice centric circuit switched communications networks  which require separate networks in order to provide voice and data services 
compared to traditional networks using legacy technologies  our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services that we believe requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus reducing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 
our strategy we intend to continue to grow our business in established markets  through both increasing the number of customers and increasing the number of services we provide  and to replicate our approach in additional markets 
we also intend to grow our business by leveraging new distribution channels to sell our cloud service offerings that are not geographically limited since they are not dependent upon the presence of physical network infrastructure 
to achieve our goal of profitably delivering sophisticated it and communications tools to small businesses in our current and future markets  we have adopted a strategy with the following principal components focus solely on the small business market 
we target small businesses since most do not have dedicated in house resources to fully address their it and communications requirements 
this type of customer places a high value on customer support 
by focusing exclusively on small business customers  we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves from larger service providers and deliver superior service that small business customers value 

table of contents become the primary provider of outsourced it and communications services to small businesses 
we seek to become the primary provider through our comprehensive packages to our core managed services customers or via cloud services to customers outside our current city footprint 
we believe that small businesses will increasingly outsource their critical it and communications functions to a trusted expert third party in order to take advantage of the convenience  reliability  security and lower costs offered 
we also believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend due to the breadth of services we offer  the quality of our service and support  and the reach of our distribution channels 
focus on customer intimacy as a point of competitive differentiation 
we strive to serve our customers by focusing on the value of our services  our service quality  convenience and strength of our relationships  in contrast to competitors whose competitive differentiation is based more on scale economies or product leadership 
we use a number of measurements to judge our progress in this area  including net promoter scores and other measures of customer satisfaction arising from customer surveys  customer churn rates  and network and application performance statistics 
we believe that our focus on customer intimacy  if successfully implemented over time  will lead to higher growth and profitability long term 
offer comprehensive packages of managed it and communications services to our core managed services customers 
we seek to be the single source provider of our it and customers communications service needs by including an integrated bundle of services in our beyondvoice packages 
our packages and add on services are designed to offer a flexible and simple means for small businesses to tailor overall service to meet their specific needs over time including the purchase of additional quantities  volumes or capacities  upgrading to more sophisticated applications  or purchasing completely new la carte services on top of their existing packages while maintaining the service integration and the convenience of a single provider 
our comprehensive packages are subscribed to under fixed length  flat rate contracts  which typically results in stable average monthly revenue per core managed services customer location or arpu  a more stable customer churn rate and greater operating efficiencies 
increase penetration of enhanced and cloud based services to our customer base 
we focus on enhancing existing applications and developing new applications that increase customer productivity and satisfaction 
as our customer base and service offering have grown  our upselling efforts to introduce new products and services to existing customers has become an increasingly important opportunity for revenue and margin growth and for maintaining a high value proposition for our customers 
focus sales and marketing resources on achieving significant market penetration 
we have chosen to focus our sales and marketing efforts on achieving deep market penetration and growing market share in a limited set of markets and gradually expanding the number of markets served  rather than taking an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets with lower market penetration 
we believe the cloud based services from the recent acquisitions will enable us to achieve even deeper market penetration in our existing markets by giving us a more comprehensive and competitive product offering 
in addition  these acquisitions allow us to also serve customers outside of our traditional markets through distribution channels we did not previously possess  including an online sales channel and a private label reseller platform 
we believe that our concentration on market share rather than market presence has resulted in our achieving profitability and economic sustainability at a faster rate and with better financial results than would have resulted from an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets with a lower market share 
in addition  because we prefer to develop and promote sales management from within  rather than hire from outside  our steadily growing base of established markets provides a training ground for management personnel who can open new markets 
replicate our business model in new geographical markets 
each time we expand into a new market  we adhere to the same processes for choosing  preparing  launching and operating in those markets that have proven successful in previous market launches 
in launching our business in each new market  we use the same disciplined financial and operational reporting system to enable us to closely monitor our costs  market penetration and provisioning of customers and maintain standards consistent with our established markets 

table of contents our strengths our business is focused on rapidly growing a loyal customer base  while maintaining capital and operating efficiency 
we believe we benefit from the following strengths our differentiated package of valuable applications 
we believe that we offer a highly differentiated package of it and communications services in order to bring big business tools to small businesses in an affordable  convenient manner 
our focus allows us to compete primarily on the basis of value rather than price  and we believe that we are able to command a premium in the market due to our ability to aggregate the essential it and communications services needed to make a small business better connected and more productive 
our customer relationships 
we have approximately  small business customers who use our core managed services  in addition to our newly acquired base of cloud services customers  all of whom comprise a stable and growing base of high quality service relationships 
we believe that our customers generally view us as a trusted it and communications expert providing high quality  reliable and convenient services supported by helpful and efficient care representatives 
our highly regimented and personalized consultative sales model 
we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting  training and deploying our direct sales representatives  which ensures a uniform sales culture and an effective means of acquiring new customers 
our direct sales representatives follow a disciplined daily schedule and meet face to face with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented and personalized consultative selling approach 
capital efficiency 
we believe that our business approach requires lower capital and operating expenditures to bring our markets to positive cash flow compared to communications carriers using legacy technologies and operating processes 
in addition  our deployment of capital in each of our markets is largely success based  meaning  over time  a large portion of our capital outlay is incurred incrementally as our customer base grows 
our automated and integrated business processes 
we believe that the combination of our disciplined approach to sales  installation and service together with our automated business processes allows us to streamline our operations and maintain low operating costs 
our front and back office systems are highly automated and are integrated to synchronize multiple tasks  including installation  billing and customer care 
we believe this allows us to lower our customer service costs  efficiently monitor the performance of our network and provide automated and responsive customer support 
our all ip network 
we are able to provide a wide range of enhanced services in a cost efficient manner over a single network  in contrast to traditional networks  which may require separate  incremental networks or substantial network upgrades in order to support similar services 
our all ip network architecture allows us to provide a comprehensive package of services with high network reliability and quality of service 
our experienced management team with focus on operating excellence 
our senior management team has substantial industry experience 
our top three executive officers each have an average of over years of experience in the communications industry and have worked at a broad range of communications companies  both startups and mature businesses  including local telephone companies  long distance carriers  competitive carriers  web hosting companies  internet and data providers and mobile communications providers 
our strong balance sheet and liquidity position 
as of december   we had a strong balance sheet with million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding debt 
we believe that cash flows from operations  cash on hand and availability under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenses  including those related to our current plans to expand our ethernet network  ramp up our cloud services division and to continue opening up new markets  depending on economic  regulatory and other conditions 
in addition  as of the date of this 
table of contents filing  we have an open  undrawn million revolving line of credit with bank of america  of which million is available due to million in letters of credit which are collateralized and outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we believe our strategies and strengths have contributed to our financial and operating performance  including consistent growth in customers  revenue and adjusted ebitda 
our customers prior to joining cbeyond  the majority of our customers received basic communications services from the incumbent local telephone companies and frequently had multiple other providers for other it and communications services 
often they simply did not utilize the kinds of it services available through our service packages 
these businesses  in most cases  did not receive the focus and personalized attention that larger enterprises enjoy and often lagged behind larger businesses in the adoption of productivity enhancing and cost effective it and communications services 
our sole focus on small businesses means no single customer or group of customers represents a significant percentage of our customer base or revenues 
similarly  no single vertical customer segment represents a significant percentage of our base 
our largest customer sectors are professional services  which include physicians  legal offices  insurance services  consulting firms  accounting firms and real estate services 
each of these sectors represents less than of our customer base 
our core managed service offerings we offer integrated managed it and communications services through our beyondvoice packages over high capacity bandwidth connections 
each of these packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus a full line of managed services and mobile services that our customers can choose from to customize their package 
the local and long distance voice services in our packages include enhanced services  which are comparable to the services offered over traditional telephone networks  and business class features  which include call forwarding  call hunting  call transfer  call waiting  caller id and three way calling 
in addition to the applications offered in our beyondvoice packages  we currently offer other services  which include voicemail  email  unified messaging  web hosting  virtual private network  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  hosted microsoft exchange  secure desktop  mobile workforce management  virtual receptionist  cloud server and cloud pbx offerings  and other applications and features to our core managed services customers 
in the future  we plan to offer additional it services and other software as a service applications 
certain of our enhanced services are included within the integrated packages  but additional quantities or features can be added to the base packages for additional fees 
our cloud services offerings we offer virtual server  dedicated server  and cloud pbx offerings via cloud servers to small businesses throughout the world on a stand alone basis  in contrast to our core managed services customers who may purchase cloud services as part of an integrated package of it and communication services 
we provide these services from servers located in our own data center facilities  enabling us to manage quality of service for our customers 

table of contents sales and marketing overview in our metropolitan markets  our sales force targets small businesses primarily through face to face meetings with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented and personalized consultative selling process 
we adhere to the same sales and operating procedures in every geographically based market we enter 
we track the performance of our sales team by maintaining detailed activity measurements in each of our markets 
our new cloud services have no geographic limitation and are sold world wide via web sales  tele sales and private label resellers 
we intend to significantly expand these sales channels 
in addition  cloud services have been launched to all of our existing channels 
we offer our customers comprehensive solutions simplified into our beyondvoice packages and sold at fixed  predetermined prices 
we permit our sales people to sell only our offered packages and do not allow them to make discounted sales or alter the beyondvoice packages other than to add enhanced services or in connection with authorized promotions 
we believe that value is the primary motivating factor for our customers 
we believe that our commitment to offering integrated packages of services helps to simplify the entry of orders into our automated provisioning and installation process 
through our strategy of offering bundled services  we seek to become the single source provider for many of our customers it and communications services 
we believe these factors contribute to our relatively stable customer churn rates 
sales channels direct sales 
the cornerstone of our geographically based sales efforts is our direct sales force 
at full staffing  we generally target an average of to sales representatives per market 
in addition to the sales representatives we deploy in our markets to call on customer prospects in person  we have a small group of centralized sales representatives who sell new accounts remotely from our corporate offices 
our direct sales force accounted for approximately of our new core managed services customers for the year ended december  we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting and training our direct sales representatives which ensures a uniform sales approach and a consistent measure of revenue targets 
we typically recruit individuals without prior telecommunications sales experience so that we can exclusively provide all of their formal training 
these unseasoned hires are designated territory sales representatives or tsrs 
during  recognizing the need for greater experience when selling more sophisticated and comprehensive service packages  we created a higher level sales consultant or scs as well 
scs typically have more extensive prior sales experience and receive more in depth training on our enhanced service offerings than tsrs 
by the end of  approximately one third of our direct sales organization were scs  and we expect that by the end of one half of the direct sales organization will be scs 
a substantial part of the compensation for our sales force is based on commission 
we reinforce our clear expectations of success through a system of increasing quotas and advancement for those who succeed 
we promote from within  where possible  and develop our own sales management talent from promising sales representatives  who have the opportunity to advance as we grow 
indirect sales 
we supplement our direct sales force with our channel partners  who leverage their pre existing business relationships with the customer and act as sales agents for us 
the channel partners include value added resellers  local area network consultants and other telecommunications and it consultants to small businesses 
as compensation for their services  our channel partners receive ongoing residual payments on their sales 
our channel partners contributed approximately of our new core managed services customers for the year ended december  solutions advisers 
in addition to our direct and indirect sales  which are dedicated to acquiring new customers  we have deployed solutions advisers to conduct account reviews with existing customers to insure 
table of contents that our customers are using the services and applications available to them and to upsell them to additional services and applications beyond what they initially purchased 
our solutions advisers are located in our sales branches in order to make calls in person on our existing customers as well as centrally in our corporate office in order to supplement our field solutions advisers with central staff who can interact with customers online or via telephone 
we believe that the solutions advisers will have an increasingly important role in our strategy of increasing the wallet share of our customers  in growing the application use of our customers  and in protecting our arpu in a price competitive environment 
private label resellers 
we have recently launched a new private label reseller or plr program to leverage our nationwide cloud services platform 
plrs will use their brand and resources to market  sell  invoice and provide support for their end user customers 
we will provide cloud services infrastructure and services  on line web portals for end user and plr account administration  technical support for the plrs  as well as  overall program management 
we will invoice the plrs  at a discount to our retail pricing  for the services consumed by their end user customers 
the private label resellers will include value added resellers  managed services providers  systems integrators and software vendors 
web sales 
as a result of the recent acquisitions  we now have a web sales channel that allows end user customers anywhere in the world to purchase cloud services  such as cloud servers and cloud pbxs  directly through the www 
cbeyondcloudservices 
com website 
the web sales channel also provides prospective customers the opportunity to request product and pricing information via web chat or phone 
we plan to continue developing and expanding the web channel through increased online marketing and marketing automation tools 
over time  we expect to offer additional cloud services through the web channel 
referral program we believe we are building a culture of referrals that benefits both our direct and indirect selling efforts 
we obtain new customers from our referral program through our current base of customers and through our referral partners 
our customers and referral partners are eligible to receive a one time referral credit for each new customer they refer 
marketing and advertising we focus our marketing resources on our direct and indirect sales efforts and programs that support those efforts 
we market ourselves as providing big solutions for growing your small business to our customers 
our marketing expenses for online marketing  events  public relations media and other marketing communications program expenses for the year ended december  were million 
operations once a customer signs on for our service  we believe we provide a highly differentiated customer experience in each aspect of the service relationship 
our highly automated and optimized business processes are designed to provide rapid and reliable installation  accurate billing and responsive  x care and support using both web enabled and human resources 
we continue to put emphasis on customer service as a key differentiator to drive customer satisfaction and customer referrals for new business 
we focus on defining the overall customer experience across all customer touch points and the implementation of a cohesive program to ensure customer satisfaction and higher customer retention rates 
this customer experience focus has also contributed to continued improvements in our automated care and support capabilities used to service our customers and increase our operational efficiency 
installation we employ a team of service coordinators in each of our geographic markets to handle the order entry and  when applicable  the customer installation process 
for core managed services customers  the centralized circuit 
table of contents provisioning and customer activation group takes responsibility for ensuring that circuits to the customer s location are provisioned correctly and on time  together with local number portability and the appropriate features and applications ordered by the customer 
these circuits have primarily been t s obtained from the local telephone company historically  but we also utilize other types of high speed connections where available and economically feasible  such as ethernet 
we seek to provision our customers within to calendar days 
our automated processes allow us to reduce the time and human intervention necessary to fill our access circuit orders with the local telephone company 
once an order is submitted  an outsourced technician is dispatched to the customer s location to install the integrated access device  to connect the customer s equipment to our network  and to activate and test the services 
after installation of the integrated access device  new services added by the customer will work with the customer s existing equipment and require no further equipment changes or capital expenditures 
for existing customers who are upgraded to our ethernet technology  a secondary device may be added to the current integrated access device at the customer location in order for customer s equipment to function on our network 
billing we bill all of our customers electronically via email 
full billing detail and analytical capabilities are available to our customers on the web 
we do not send any paper bills 
in addition  over of our customers pay us online  either via credit card  electronic funds transfer  or automatic account debit 
because we employ a simple flat rate billing in advance  we believe that customers are able to budget their costs and minimize errors 
our flat rate billing  electronic invoicing and online payments greatly reduces the amount of resources needed for billing functions 
customer care and cbeyond online we offer our customers support through live access to dedicated care representatives and through online resources twenty four hours a day  seven days a week 
although customers can choose to speak with one of our cbeyond representatives on a real time basis  cbeyond online has become our primary channel for customer care 
we offer a broad range of capabilities through cbeyond online  including functions allowing customers to review requested services and accept installation orders for new customers  view  pay and analyze bills  view and modify services and account features  view and modify account information  research products and troubleshoot issues using the section of our website devoted to frequently asked questions  which we call our find it fast knowledge base  and submit requests for and track account changes 
underpinning our care and support operations is a network that provides our customers with reliable and high quality service 
our network operations group manages and tracks network performance 
we have deployed state of the art network monitoring and diagnostic tools to provide our care representatives and network operations center personnel with real time insight into problem areas and the information needed to address them 
our all ip network architecture our core managed services employs a single integrated network using technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converges them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
we transmit our core managed services customers voice traffic over our secure private network and do not rely on 
table of contents the best efforts public internet 
our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services and requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional networks using legacy technologies 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus minimizing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 
our ip network architecture achieves a lower cost structure than legacy designs primarily through enabling us to buy fewer network components and at lower cost  lease fewer telecommunications circuits  employ fewer staff  rent less collocation space  incur lower maintenance costs  and integrate fewer support systems 
we organize our core managed services network into three groupings of equipment and circuits for purposes of network management and quality measurement the core network  which is located in our data centers or market tandem offices  primarily comprises softswitches  backbone routers and media and feature servers  the distribution network  which includes collocation equipment such as t aggregation routers and trunking gateways  as well as ds transport circuits  and the access network  which comprises the t local loops  or other access circuits such as ethernet  and integrated access devices that connect customers equipment to our extended network 
our software monitors network quality and tracks potential problems by monitoring each of these network groupings 
the largest single monthly expense associated with our network is the cost of leasing t circuits to connect to our customers 
we have begun offering our services using ethernet in place of t circuits 
although not available to us on an ubiquitous basis in all areas  ethernet technology provides us with the opportunity to offer a large percentage of our customers bandwidth at speeds well in excess of t circuits while potentially reducing our ongoing operating expense 
although we have recently begun providing service to many of our customers using ethernet technology  our business continues to rely heavily on the use of t circuits 
we lease t circuits primarily from the local telephone companies on a wholesale basis 
we are able to obtain cost based pricing because we meet certain qualifying criteria established by the federal communications commission  or the fcc  for use of these services and because we have built the processes and systems to take advantage of these wholesale circuits  in contrast to many competitive carriers  which lease t circuits under special access  or retail  pricing 
as a result of regulatory changes adopted via the fcc s triennial review remand order  or trro  we are required to lease t circuits under special access pricing when serving customers in certain geographical areas within the cities we serve 
see government regulation 
we employ these wholesale t circuits as follows une loops 
an unbundled network element  or une  loop is the facility that extends from the customer s premises to our equipment collocated in the local exchange company end office that serves that customer location 
we employ une loops when we have a collocation in the central office that serves a customer 
we use high capacity t unbundled loops to serve our customers 

table of contents eels 
an enhanced extended link  or eel  is a combination of an unbundled t loop and an associated t transport element that are joined together by the local telephone company at the end office serving the customer location 
this allows us to obtain access to customer premises without having a collocation at the serving central office 
the current fcc rules require local telephone companies to provide t eels to carriers subject to certain local use criteria  which we meet 
once we achieve sufficient density from a remote office  we deploy a dedicated ds transport and regroom the t transport elements onto the ds transport circuit and remove the t transport elements 
historically  approximately half of our circuits were provisioned using une loops and half using eels 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using une loops rather than eels  but une loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office collocation equipment 
both une loops and eels are substantially less expensive for us than special access circuits 
we lease ds circuits from local telephone companies or competitive carriers to carry traffic from the end office collocation to our equipment in a tandem wire center collocation 
the impact of the trro has reduced our usage of the t transport portion of eels and resulted in the conversion and consolidation of a majority of the previously installed t transports to high capacity ds transport 
we install central office collocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch a market with several collocations and add collocations as the business grows 
for example  in atlanta  our most mature market  we had collocations at the time of our initial public offering in november and collocations as of december  we currently serve just over of our customers with ethernet but are ramping up our capabilities to process conversions to ethernet and expect to have converted at least one third of our existing customer base by early we expect to incur capital expenditures of up to approximately million through associated with the ethernet conversions and expect to achieve significant access cost savings over time 
competition we broadly compete with companies that could provide both voice and enhanced services to small businesses in our markets 
as a provider of voice services  our primary competitors are the incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs qwest currently being acquired by centurylink in denver  minneapolis  and seattle  at t in atlanta  dallas  detroit  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  miami and the san francisco bay area  and verizon in the washington  dc and boston areas 
in addition to the local telephone companies  we compete with other competitive carriers in each of our markets 
these competitive carriers include xo communications  llc  windstream formerly nuvox communications  paetec  integra telecom  inc  telepacific communications and itc deltacom  inc recently acquired by earthlink  among many others 
certain of these competitive carriers have adopted voip technology similar to that employed by us  and in the future we expect others to do so 
based on information provided by our customers at the time of activation  approximately of our customers used an incumbent local exchange carrier  or ilec  for local telephone service prior to signing with us  and the remainder used competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs 
many of our customers  prior to joining with us  used multiple vendors for local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access and have enjoyed the convenience of a sole sourced service since signing with us 
in addition  there are other providers using voip technology  such as vonage holdings corp  skype technologies sa  a subsidiary of ebay  inc  deltathree  inc 
and x  inc  which offer service using the public internet to access their customers 
we do not currently view these companies as our direct competitors because they primarily serve the consumer market and businesses with fewer than four lines 
certain cable television companies  such as cox communications  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  timewarner cable  inc 
and cablevision systems corp  have deployed voip to address both consumers and business customers  primarily to compete better against local telephone companies 

table of contents we expect that  in the future  other companies may be formed to take advantage of our voip based business model 
existing companies may also expand their focus in the future to target small business customers 
in addition  certain utility companies have begun experimenting with delivering voice and high speed data services over power lines 
in connection with our beyondmobile offering  we compete with national wireless phone companies  such as at t  sprint corporation  t mobile usa  inc and verizon wireless  as well as regional wireless providers 
in connection with our cloud services offerings  we compete with several cloud server and cloud pbx service providers 
with respect to cloud server and other hosting services  we compete with companies such as rackspace hosting  hosting 
com  microsoft  godaddy 
com  and amazon web services 
in the cloud pbx  space we compete with hosted pbx providers such as x inc  telesphere  bandwidth 
com  broadvox  simplesignal  and vocalocity 
government regulation as a company that sells telecommunications services as part of a bundle of managed software  our business is  in part  subject to the statutory framework established by united states congress  or congress  in the federal telecommunications act of  or the telecom act  various state statues and varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
in contrast to certain other ip based carriers  we have elected to operate as a common carrier  and accordingly  our business does not rely on the regulatory classification of  or regulatory treatment for  ip based carriers in particular 
as a common carrier  we are subject to the jurisdiction of both federal and state regulatory agencies which have the authority to review our prices  terms and conditions of service 
these regulatory agencies exercise minimal control over our prices and services  but do impose various obligations such as reporting  payment of fees and compliance with consumer protection and public safety requirements 
further  under limited circumstances  we are also subject to requirements placed on interconnected voip providers in addition to the requirements we are subject to as a common carrier 
we operate as a facilities based carrier and have received all necessary state and federal authorizations to do so 
unlike resale carriers  we do not rely upon access to ilecs  such as at t or verizon  switching facilities or capabilities 
as a facilities based carrier  we have undertaken a variety of regulatory obligations  including for example providing access to emergency systems  permitting law enforcement officials access to our network upon proper authorization  contributing to the cost of the fcc s and  where applicable  the state universal service programs and making our services accessible to persons with disabilities 
by operating as a common carrier  we also benefit from certain legal rights established by federal legislation  especially the telecom act which gives us and other common carrier competitive entrants the right to interconnect to the networks of the ilecs and to access elements of their networks on an unbundled basis 
these rights are not available to providers who do not operate as common carriers 
we have used these rights to gain interconnection with the ilec in each greater metropolitan area where we provide service and to purchase selected unes  at prices based on incremental cost  that provide us with dependable  high quality digital access to our customers premises which we use to provide them with a bundle of management software services 
congress  the fcc and state regulators are considering a variety of issues that may result in changes in the statutory and regulatory environment in which we operate our business 
while negative federal legislation is always a possibility  we believe it unlikely that any such negative legislation will be passed by congress in  we also believe the fcc is unlikely to adopt rules that extinguish our basic right or ability to compete in the telecommunications markets and that any rule changes that affect us will likely be accompanied by transition periods sufficient to allow us to adjust our business practices accordingly 
some of the changes under consideration by congress  the fcc and state regulators could affect our competitors differently than they affect us 

table of contents regulatory framework although we have begun providing service to our customers using ethernet technology over copper loops that are delivered to us without heavy reliance on ilec provided electronics  our business continues to rely heavily on the use of t une loops and eels that include t loop components  for access to customer premises 
our existing strategy is based on fcc rules that require ilecs to provide us these unes at wholesale prices based on incremental costs in all wire centers except those with the densest concentration of loops serving business customers 
this exception affects the price we pay to obtain access to t loops in some of the central business districts we serve 
these rules that currently govern our access to both t and copper loop unes may change due to future fcc decisions  and we are unable to predict how such future developments may affect our business 
the telecom act the telecom act  which substantially revised the communications act of  established the regulatory preconditions to allow companies like us to compete for the provision of local communications services 
we have developed our business  including being designated as a common carrier  and designed and constructed our networks to take advantage of the features of the telecom act that require cooperation from the incumbent carriers 
there have been numerous attempts to revise or eliminate the basic framework for competition in the local exchange services market through a combination of federal legislation  new fcc rules and challenges to existing and proposed regulations by the incumbent carriers 
we anticipate that congress will consider a range of proposals to modify the telecom act over the next few years  including some proposals that could restrict or eliminate our access to elements of the ilecs networks 
we consider it unlikely  however  that congress would reverse the fundamental policy of encouraging competition in communications markets 
congress may also consider legislation that would address the impact of the internet on the telecom act 
such legislation could seek to clarify the regulations applicable to voip and internet providers 
we believe that such legislation is unlikely to result in the imposition of new regulatory obligations on us  although it is possible that it will eliminate certain regulatory obligations that apply to us as a result of our status as a common carrier 
federal regulation the fcc regulates interstate and international communications services in the united states  including access to local communications networks for the origination and termination of these services 
we provide interstate and international services on a common carrier basis 
the fcc requires all common carriers to obtain an authorization to construct and operate communications facilities and to provide or resell communications services between the united states and international points 
we have secured authority from the fcc for the installation  acquisition and operation of our wireline network facilities to provide facilities based domestic and international services 
unlike incumbent carriers  our retail services are not currently subject to price cap or rate of return regulation 
we are therefore free to set our own prices for end user services subject only to the general federal guidelines that our charges for interstate and international services be just  reasonable and non discriminatory 
we have filed tariffs with the fcc containing interstate rates we charge to long distance carriers for access to our network  also called interstate access charges 
the rates we can charge for interstate access  unlike our end user services  are limited by fcc rules 
we are also required to file periodic reports  to pay regulatory fees based on our interstate revenues and to comply with fcc regulations concerning the content and format of our bills  the process for changing a customer s subscribed carrier and other consumer protection matters 
the fcc has the authority to impose monetary forfeitures and to condition or revoke a carrier s operating authority for violations of these requirements 
our operating costs are increased by the need to assure compliance with these regulatory obligations 

table of contents as a key part of its regulatory mandate  the fcc constantly reviews the regulations it administers  these proceedings could eventually have some impact on our ability to buy unes in one or more markets we serve or wish to serve  the prices we pay for unes  the prices we pay for special access facilities  intercarrier compensation rates  interconnection rules  universal service fund rates and other rules and regulations that impact our business 
we monitor these proceedings closely and are active participants in those that could have the most impact on us  whether positive or negative 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or new proceedings that may be initiated 
changes in the universal service fund may affect the fees we are required to pay to this program  but since we and our competitors generally pass these fees through to customers  we expect any changes to have minimal competitive effect 
similarly  we do not expect changes in inter carrier compensation rules to have a material effect on us because we derive the vast majority of our revenues directly from our customers  rather than from other carriers 
reciprocal compensation for termination of local calls is not a significant source of revenue  and we derive relatively little revenue from access charges for origination and termination of long distance calls over our network 
we expect that nationwide access to t and copper loops serving current and new customer locations will continue to be available to us regardless of future changes in the fcc rules  although not necessarily at current prices 
all ilecs are required  independent of the une rules  to offer us some form of t loop and transport services as well as copper loops without associated electronics 
it is possible that the fcc may establish rates for some of these services at levels that are comparable to current une rates  or that we may be able to negotiate reasonable prices for these services through commercial negotiations with ilecs 
however  we cannot be assured that either of these possibilities will occur 
if all other options were unavailable  we would be required to pay special access rates for these services 
these rates are substantially higher than the rates we pay for unes 
centurylink acquisition of qwest 
centurylink is expected to complete its acquisition of qwest in the first half of  and the fcc is expected both to grant its approval of the transaction and to impose significant conditions upon it 
we cannot predict what those conditions will be  but we expect them to be similar to those placed upon earlier mergers such at the at t bellsouth merger and to provide more regulatory stability in the territory of the former qwest ilec for several years  we currently provide services in the qwest cities of denver  minneapolis and seattle  and we could expand into additional qwest cities in the future 
we do not expect the acquisition to have a significant impact upon our operations as centurylink will be subject to the same continuing regulations and obligations as was qwest 
state regulation state agencies exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services  including local telephone service and in state toll calls 
to date  we are authorized to provide intrastate local telephone  long distance telephone and operator services in california  colorado  florida  georgia  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  texas  virginia  washington  and the district of columbia  as well as in other states where we are not yet operational 
as a condition to providing intrastate telecommunications services  we are required  among other things  to file and maintain intrastate tariffs or price lists describing the rates  terms and conditions of our services  comply with state regulatory reporting  tax and fee obligations  including contributions to intrastate universal service funds  and comply with  and to submit to  state regulatory jurisdiction over consumer protection policies including regulations governing customer privacy  changing of service providers and content of customer bills  complaints  transfers of control and certain financing transactions 
generally  state regulatory authorities can condition  modify  cancel  terminate or revoke certificates of authority to operate in a state for failure to comply with state laws or the rules  regulations and policies of the state regulatory authority 
fines and other penalties may also be imposed for such violations 
as we expand our operations  the requirements specific to any individual state will be evaluated to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of that state 

table of contents in addition  the states have authority under the telecom act to approve or  in limited circumstances reject agreements for the interconnection of telecommunications carriers facilities with those of the ilec  to arbitrate disputes arising in negotiations for interconnection and to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements 
in exercising this authority  the states determine the rates  terms and conditions under which we can obtain access to the loop and transport unes that are required to be available under the fcc rules 
the states may re examine these rates  terms and conditions from time to time 
state governments and their regulatory authorities may also assert jurisdiction over the provision of intrastate ip communications services where they believe that their authority is broad enough to cover regulation of ip based services 
various state regulatory authorities have initiated proceedings to examine the regulatory status of ip telephony services 
we operate as a regulated carrier subject to state regulation  rules and fees and  therefore  do not expect to be affected by these proceedings 
the fcc proceeding on voip discussed above is expected to address  among other issues  the appropriate role of state governments in the regulation of these services 
local regulation in certain locations  we are required to obtain local franchises  licenses or other operating rights and street opening and construction permits to install  expand and operate our telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
in some of the areas where we provide services  we pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of gross revenues 
cities that do not currently impose fees might seek to impose them in the future  and after the expiration of existing franchises  fees could increase 
under the telecom act  state and local governments retain the right to manage the public rights of way and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers  on a competitively neutral and non discriminatory basis  to recover the costs associated with government s management of the public rights of way 
as noted above  these activities must be consistent with the telecom act and may not have the effect of prohibiting us from providing telecommunications services in any particular local jurisdiction 
in certain circumstances  we may be subject to local fees associated with construction and operation of telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
to the extent these fees are required  we comply with requirements to collect and remit the fees

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our growth and financial health are subject to a number of economic risks 
as widely reported  the financial markets in the united states have been experiencing significant disruption in the past three years  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these conditions or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so 
this could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions 
while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies 
we attempt to monitor the financial health of significant vendors because these economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of third party vendors important to our operations to continue as going concerns 
if such vendors were to fail  we may not be able to replace them without disruptions to  or deterioration of  our service and we may also incur higher costs associated with the new vendors 
transitioning to new vendors may also result in the loss of the value of assets associated with our integration of third party services into our network or service offering 
the depth and duration of the challenging economy on the small business sector may also reduce the size and viability of our addressable markets of small businesses  particularly in geographic areas where the economic impacts are most severe 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the lingering effects of the challenging economy on the small business sector 
the success of our growth and expansion plans depends on a number of factors that are beyond our control 
we have grown our business by increasing the number of customers in existing markets  entering new geographical markets  and selling additional services to existing customers  and we plan to continue opening up to one to three new markets per year beginning in  depending on economic  regulatory and other conditions 
there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our growth or that we will choose to target the same pace of market growth in the future 
our success in achieving continued growth and expansion into new markets depends upon several factors including the availability and retention of qualified and effective personnel with the expertise required to sell and operate effectively or successfully  the overall economic health of new and existing markets or small businesses in general  the number and effectiveness of competitors  the pricing structure under which we will be able to obtain circuits and purchase other services required to serve our customers  the availability to us of technologies needed to remain competitive  our ability to establish a relationship and work effectively with the local telephone company for the provision of access lines to customers  and state and regulatory conditions  including the maintenance of state regulation that protects us from unfair business practices by local telephone companies or others with greater market power who have relationships with us as both competitors and suppliers 

table of contents acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business 
we may continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy  that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment  or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees  business systems  and technology  or diversion of management s attention from our other businesses 
these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base 
we experienced an annual growth rate greater than in customer locations during  which was a decline compared to the growth rate in the prior year 
we may not experience this same growth rate in the future  or we may not grow at all  in our current markets 
future growth in our existing markets may be more difficult than our growth has been to date due to increased or more effective competition in the future  difficulties in scaling our business systems and processes or difficulty in maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified market management personnel  sales personnel and qualified integrated access device installation service providers to obtain and support additional customers 
the fixed pricing structure for our integrated packages makes us vulnerable to price increases by our suppliers for network equipment and access fees for circuits that we lease to gain access to our customers 
we offer our integrated packages to customers at a fixed price for one  two or three years 
if we experience an increase in our costs due to price increases from our suppliers  vendors or third party carriers or increases in access fees  installation fees  interconnection fees payable to local telephone companies or other fees  we may not be able to pass these increases on to our customers immediately  and this could materially harm our results of operations 
we face intense competition from other providers of communications services that have significantly greater resources than we do 
several of these competitors are better positioned to engage in competitive pricing  which may impede our ability to implement our business model of attracting customers away from such providers 
the market for communications services is highly competitive 
we compete  and expect to continue to compete  with many types of communications providers  including traditional local telephone companies 
in the future  we may also face increased competition from cable companies  new voip based service providers or other managed service providers with similar business models to our own 
we integrated mobile services with our existing services in the first quarter of and now face competition from mobile service providers as well 
our current or future competitors may provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us  or at lower prices  or adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
a substantial majority of our target customers are existing small businesses that are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers 
the success of our operations is in part dependent on our ability to persuade these small businesses to leave their current providers 
many of these providers have competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  better access to capital  brand name recognition and long standing relationships with customers 
these resources may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our current markets and limit our ability to expand into new markets 
because of their greater financial resources  some of our competitors can also better afford to reduce prices for their services and engage in aggressive promotional activities 
such tactics could have a negative impact on our business 
for example  some of our competitors have adopted pricing plans such that the rates that they charge are not always substantially higher  and in some cases are lower  than the rates that we charge for similar services 
in addition  other providers are offering unlimited or nearly unlimited use of some of their services for an attractive monthly rate 
any of the foregoing factors could require us to further reduce our prices to remain competitive or cause us to lose customers  resulting in a decrease in arpu 

table of contents increasing use of voip technology by our competitors  entry into the market by new providers employing voip technology and improvements in quality of service of voip technology provided over the public internet could increase competition 
our success is based partly on our ability to provide voice and broadband services at a price that customers typically pay for voice services alone by taking advantage of cost savings achieved by employing voip technology  as compared to using traditional networks 
the adoption of voip technology by other communications carriers  including existing competitors such as local telephone companies that currently use legacy technologies  could increase price competition 
moreover  other voip providers could also enter the market 
because networks using voip technology can be deployed with less capital investment than traditional networks  there are lower barriers to entry in this market  and it may be easier for new entrants to emerge 
increased competition may require us to lower our prices or may make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers or add new customers 
we believe we generally do not compete with voip providers who use the public internet to transmit communications traffic  as these providers generally do not provide the level and quality of service typically demanded by the business customers we serve 
however  future advances in voip technology may enable these providers to offer an improved level and quality of service to business customers over the public internet and with lower costs than using a private network 
this development could result in increased price competition and may affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
continued industry consolidation could further strengthen our competitors  and we could lose customers or face adverse changes in regulation 
in the past five years  verizon merged with mci  sbc merged with at t  at t and bellsouth merged  comcast cable corporation acquired a competitive local exchange company based in the midwest and a nationwide wholesale provider of hosted voip services  windstream corporation acquired nuvox  inc  a privately held clec and competitor  and centurylink announced its intention to purchase qwest  a deal that is likely to close during the increased size and market power of these companies may have adverse consequences for us  and other large mergers may create larger and more efficient competitors 
these competitors could focus their large resources on regaining share in the small business sector  and we could lose customers or not grow as rapidly 
furthermore  these companies could use their greater resources to lobby effectively for changes in federal or state regulation that could have an adverse effect on our cost structure or our right to use access circuits that they are currently required to make available to us 
these changes could have a harmful effect on our future financial results 
we are susceptible to business and political risks from our use of international third party resources that could result in delays in the development or maintenance of operational support systems and business processes 
a portion of our it development is performed by third parties with offshore resources 
there are inherent risks in engaging offshore resources including difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in political or economic conditions and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we do not manage our international third party vendors successfully  our business could be adversely affected 
our operational support systems and business processes may not be adequate to effectively manage our growth 
our continued success depends on the scalability of our systems and processes 
as of december   none of our individual market operations have supported levels of customers substantially in excess of  
table of contents and our centralized systems and processes have not supported more than approximately  customer locations 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes are adequate to support ongoing growth in customers 
in addition  our growing managed services profile  including our new mobile services and associated new applications  may create operating inefficiencies and result in service problems if we are unsuccessful in fully integrating such new services into our existing operations 
failure to manage our future growth effectively could harm our quality of service and customer relationships  which could increase our customer churn  result in higher operating costs  write offs or other accounting charges and otherwise materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on local telephone companies for the installation and maintenance of our customers t or other access lines and other network elements and facilities 
our customers t or other access lines are installed and maintained by local telephone companies in each of our markets 
if the local telephone company does not perform the installation properly or in a timely manner  our customers could experience disruption in service and delays in obtaining our services 
since inception  we have experienced routine delays in the installation of t lines by the local telephone companies to our customers in each of our markets  although these delays have not yet resulted in any material impact to our ability to compete and add customers in our markets 
any work stoppage action by employees of a local telephone company that provides us services in one of our markets could result in substantial delays in activating new customers lines and could materially harm our operations 
although local telephone companies may be required to pay fines and penalties to us for failures to provide us with these installation and maintenance services according to prescribed time intervals  the negative impact on our business of such failures could substantially exceed the amount of any such cash payments 
furthermore  we are also dependent on traditional local telephone companies for access to their collocation facilities  and we utilize certain of their network elements 
failure of these elements or damage to a local telephone company s collocation facility could cause disruptions in our service 
we depend on third party providers who install our integrated access devices at customer locations 
we must maintain relationships with efficient installation service providers in our current cities and identify similar providers as we enter new markets in order to maintain quality in our operations 
the installation of integrated access devices at customer locations is an essential step that enables our customers to obtain our service 
we outsource the installation of integrated access devices to a number of different installation vendors in each market 
we must ensure that these vendors adhere to the timelines and quality that we require to provide our customers with a positive installation experience 
in addition  we must obtain these installation services at reasonable prices 
if we are unable to continue maintaining a sufficient number of installation vendors in our markets who provide high quality service at reasonable prices to us  we may have to use our own employees to perform installations of integrated access devices 
we may not be able to manage such installations effectively using our own employees with the quality we desire and at reasonable costs 
some of our services are dependent on facilities and systems maintained by or equipment manufactured by third parties over which we have no control  the failure of which could cause interruptions or discontinuation of some of our services  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers or limit our growth 
we provide some of our existing services  such as secure desktop  by reselling to our customers services provided by third parties  and beginning in the first quarter of  we started offering mobile options integrated with our existing services by reselling mobile services provided by an established national third party mobile carrier and reselling mobile equipment manufactured by third parties 
we do not have control over the networks and other systems maintained by these third parties or their equipment manufacturing processes  facilities or supply chains 
if our third party providers fail to maintain their facilities properly or fail to respond quickly to network or other problems  our customers may experience interruptions in the service they obtain from us or we may not be able to supply the needed mobile equipment 
any service interruptions experienced by our customers could negatively impact our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our ability to attract new customers 

table of contents some of the services we provide are regulated by the fcc  state public service commissions and local regulating governmental bodies 
changes in regulation could result in price increases on the circuits that we lease from the local telephone companies or losing our right to lease these circuits from them 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulation by telecommunications authorities at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in regulatory policy could increase the fees we must pay to third parties  make certain required inputs for our network less readily available to us or subject us to more stringent requirements that could cause us to incur additional operating expenditures 
the t and copper loop connections we provide to our customers are leased primarily from our competitors  the local telephone companies 
the rules of the fcc  adopted under the telecom act  generally entitle us to lease these connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
it is possible  though we believe unlikely  that congress will pass legislation in the future that will diminish or eliminate our right to lease such connections at regulated rates 
our rights of access to the facilities of local telephone companies may also change as a result of future regulatory decisions  including forbearance petitions  as well as court decisions 
to date  no forbearance petitions have been granted that have had any impact on our operations and none are pending 
this could change  however  and there is the possibility that future forbearance grants could limit our various rights under the telecom act 
although we expect that we will continue to be able to obtain t and other copper loop connections for our customers  we may not be able to do so at current prices 
the pricing for the majority of the t and other copper loop connections we use is established by state regulatory commissions and  from time to time  this pricing is reviewed and the state commission decisions are subject to appeal 
if our right to obtain these connections at regulated prices based on incremental costs is further impaired  we will need either to negotiate new commercial arrangements with the local telephone companies to obtain the connections  perhaps at unfavorable rates and conditions  or to obtain other means of providing connections to our customers  which may be expensive and require a long timeframe to implement  either of which may cause us to exit such affected markets and decrease our customer base and revenues 
the fcc is also considering changing its rules for calculating incremental cost based rates  which could result in either increases or decreases in our cost to lease these facilities 
significant increases in wholesale prices  especially for the loop element we use most extensively  could materially harm our business 
we are required to bill taxes  fees  and other amounts to our customers on behalf of government entities 
determining the services on which such amounts should be assessed and how to calculate the proper amounts can be complex and may involve judgment that an assessing entity may disagree with  exposing us to the possibility of material liabilities for amounts we did not bill to our customers  including interest and penalties 
we are required to bill taxes  fees and other amounts collectively referred to as taxes on behalf of government entities on some of the services we provide to our customers 
these entities include governments and governmental authorities at the county  city  state and federal level taxing authorities 
each taxing authority may have one or more taxes with unique rules as to which services are subject to each tax and how those services should be taxed 
while some types of taxes may be similar among many taxing authorities  the rules and applicable rates are often unique and change from time to time 
determining which taxing authorities have jurisdiction for a customer  which taxes are applicable  and how the specific rules should be applied often involves exercising judgment and making estimations 
the nature of this process creates a risk of non compliance  such as subjecting a customer to the wrong taxing authorities 
other risks that represent higher exposure to us include interpreting rules in a manner that may differ from the taxing authority  resulting in one or more of the following outcomes we may not charge for a tax that we may be liable for  we may charge for a tax at a rate that is lower than what we may be liable for  or we may apply the correct rate using a methodology that differs from the applicable taxing authority s methodology 
because we sell many of our services on a bundled basis and assess different taxes on the individual components included within the bundle  there is also a risk that a taxing authority could disagree with the taxable value of a component 

table of contents taxing authorities can perform audits for any period or periods still open for review under the applicable statute 
these statutes typically provide that periods remain open for three to four years 
if we were found to be improperly assessing taxes and were assessed for multiple years of under billing our customers we could be subject to significant assessments of past taxes  fines and interest  which could materially harm our financial condition 
the fcc is reexamining its policies towards voip and telecommunications in general 
new or existing regulation could subject us to additional fees or increase the competition we face 
we currently operate as a regulated common carrier  which subjects us to some regulatory obligations 
the fcc adopted rules applicable to interconnected voip providers  but it has not determined whether to classify interconnected voip providers as common carriers 
the rules applicable to interconnected voip providers require them to provide access to emergency services for all customers that are comparable to the services provided by traditional telephone networks  to implement certain capabilities for the monitoring of communications by law enforcement agencies pursuant to a subpoena or court order and to contribute to the federal universal service fund 
as a common carrier  we currently comply with the requirements  comply with the law enforcement assistance requirements applicable to traditional telecommunications carriers and contribute to the federal universal service fund 
the fcc continues to examine its policies towards services provided over ip networks  such as our voip technology  and the results of these proceedings could impose additional obligations  fees or limitations on us 
regulatory decisions may also affect the level of competition we face 
reduced regulation of retail services offered by local telephone companies could increase the competitive advantages those companies enjoy  cause us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive or otherwise make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers 
our customer churn rate may increase 
customer churn occurs when a customer discontinues service with us  whether voluntary or involuntary  such as a customer going out of business or switching to a competitor 
changes in the economy  increased competition from other providers  or issues with the quality of service we deliver can impact our customer churn rate 
we cannot predict future pricing by our competitors  but we anticipate that price competition will continue 
lower prices offered by our competitors could contribute to an increase in customer churn 
prior to  we historically maintained monthly churn rates of approximately 
beginning with the third quarter of  however  we have experienced elevated churn rates that we believe are attributable primarily to the inability of certain of our customers to meet their payment obligations as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
our core managed services experienced an average monthly churn rate of in compared to in we cannot predict the duration or magnitude of the currently deteriorated economic conditions or its impact on our target of small business customers 
we expect our core managed services average monthly churn rate to continue to be greater than for at least as long as the current economic environment persists 
higher customer churn rates could adversely impact our revenue growth 
a sustained and significant growth in the churn rate could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third party suppliers 
our success depends upon the quality  availability and price of these suppliers network equipment and software 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third party suppliers 
in addition  we rely on these suppliers for technical support and assistance 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with these suppliers  if any of them were to terminate our relationship or were to cease making the equipment and software we use  our ability to efficiently maintain  upgrade or expand our network could be impaired 
although we believe that we would be able to address our future equipment needs 
table of contents with equipment obtained from other suppliers  we cannot assure that such equipment would be compatible with our network without significant modifications or cost  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain the equipment necessary to maintain our network  our ability to attract and retain customers and provide our services would be impaired 
in addition  our success depends in part on our obtaining network equipment and software at affordable prices 
significant increases in the price of these products would harm our financial results and may increase our capital requirements 
we depend on third party vendors for information systems 
if these vendors discontinue support for the systems we use or fail to maintain quality in future software releases  we could incur substantial unplanned costs to switch or upgrade our systems or equipment  and we could sustain a negative impact on the quality of our services to customers  the development of new services and features and the quality of information needed to manage our business 
we have entered into agreements with vendors that provide for the development and operation of back office systems  such as ordering  provisioning and billing systems 
we also rely on vendors to provide the systems for monitoring the performance and condition of our network 
the failure of those vendors to perform their services in a timely and effective manner at acceptable costs could materially harm our growth and our ability to monitor costs  bill customers and carriers  provision customer orders  maintain the network and achieve operating efficiencies 
such a failure could also negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
in december  the organization that provides our customer billing system was sold to paetec  a competitive local exchange carrier 
we are taking steps to mitigate intellectual capital  ongoing development and support risks 
we use software technology developed internally and by third party vendors  and hardware technology developed by third party vendors 
we or any of these vendors could be the subject of a lawsuit alleging a violation of the intellectual property of third parties 
we have created software systems  purchased software from third party vendors and purchased hardware from third party vendors 
our contracts with these vendors provide indemnification to us should any entity allege that we are violating its intellectual property 
should an entity bring suit or otherwise pursue intellectual property claims against us based on its own technology or the technology of third party vendors  the result of those claims could be to raise our costs or deny us access to technology currently necessary to our network or software systems 
if we are unable to generate the cash that we need to pursue our business plan  we may have to raise additional capital on terms unfavorable to our stockholders 
the actual amount of capital required to fund our operations and development may vary materially from our estimates 
if our operations fail to generate the cash that we expect  we may have to seek additional capital to fund our business 
if we are required to obtain additional funding in the future  we may have to sell assets  seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital 
in addition  the terms of our secured revolving line of credit with bank of america subjects us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and any other indebtedness we incur in the future is likely to include similar covenants 
if we do not comply with such covenants  our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings 
if we raise funds by selling more stock  our stockholders ownership in us will be diluted  and we may grant future investors rights superior to those of the common stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may have to delay  modify or abandon some of our expansion plans 
this could slow our growth  negatively affect our ability to compete in our industry and adversely affect our financial condition 

table of contents if we cannot negotiate new or extensions of existing interconnection agreements with local telephone companies on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide service to our existing customers or to expand our business 
we have agreements for the interconnection of our network with the networks of the local telephone companies covering each market in which we operate 
these agreements also provide the framework for service to our customers when other local carriers are involved 
we will be required to negotiate new interconnection agreements to enter new markets in the future 
in addition  we will need to negotiate extension or replacement agreements as our existing interconnection agreements expire 
most of our interconnection agreements have terms of three years  although the parties may mutually decide to amend the terms of such agreements 
if we cannot negotiate new interconnection agreements or renew our existing interconnection agreements on favorable terms or at all  we may invoke binding arbitration by state regulatory agencies 
the arbitration process is expensive and time consuming  and the results of an arbitration may be unfavorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain favorable interconnection terms  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our current and new markets 
the cloud based computing model presents execution and competitive risks 
we are transitioning to a computing environment characterized by cloud based services used with smart client devices 
our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based services for consumers and business customers 
pricing and delivery models are evolving 
devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud 
we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud based software plus services strategies 
while we believe our expertise  investments in infrastructure  and the breadth of our cloud based services provides us with a strong foundation to compete  it is uncertain whether our strategies or technologies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful 
in addition to software development costs  we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services 
these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved 
whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas  including continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share  maintaining the utility  compatibility and performance of our cloud based services on the growing array of computing devices  including smartphones  handheld computers  netbooks  and tablets  and continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third party developers 
we have an mvno agreement with a nationwide wireless network provider 
if we cannot negotiate extensions of this agreement on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide mobile services to our existing customers or to expand our business 
we provide mobile services to our customers under a mvno agreement with a nationwide wireless network provider 
upon or before expiration of the current contract term in  we will need to renew this agreement or enter an agreement with another provider 
in addition  we will need to negotiate amendments to our mvno agreement as services or technologies evolve in order to offer competitive services to our customers 
if we cannot renew our existing agreement  enter into an agreement with another provider or negotiate amendments on favorable terms or at all  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our current and new markets 
our current and future competitors may be better positioned than we are to adapt to rapid changes in technology  and we could lose customers as a result 
the communications industry has experienced  and will probably continue to experience  rapid and significant changes in technology 
technological changes  such as the use of wireless or other alternatives to network access to customers in place of the t or other access lines we lease from the local telephone companies  could render aspects of the technology we employ suboptimal or obsolete and provide a competitive 
table of contents advantage to new or larger competitors who might more easily be able to take advantage of these opportunities 
some of our competitors  including the local telephone companies  have a much longer operating history  more experience in making upgrades to their networks and greater financial resources than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain access to new technologies  or that we will be able to do so as quickly or on the same terms as our competitors  or that we will be able to apply new technologies to our existing networks without incurring significant costs 
in addition  responding to demand for new technologies would require us to increase our capital expenditures  which may require additional financing in order to fund 
as a result of those factors  we could lose customers and our financial results could be harmed 
system disruptions could cause delays or interruptions of our service  which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses 
our success depends on our ability to provide reliable service 
although we have designed our network service to minimize the possibility of service disruptions or other outages  our service may be disrupted by problems on our system  such as malfunctions in our software or other facilities  overloading of our network and problems with the systems of competitors with which we interconnect  such as physical damage to telephone lines and power surges and outages 
although we have experienced isolated power disruptions and other outages for short time periods  we have not had system wide disruptions of a sufficient duration or magnitude that had a significant impact on our customers or our business 
any significant disruption in our network could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses 
business disruptions  including disruptions caused by security breaches  extreme weather  terrorism or other disasters  could harm our future operating results 
the day to day operation of our business is highly dependent on the integrity of our communications and information technology systems  and on our ability to protect those systems from damage or interruptions by events beyond our control 
sabotage  computer viruses or other infiltration by third parties could damage our systems 
such events could disrupt our service  damage our facilities  damage our reputation  and cause us to lose customers  among other things  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  a catastrophic event could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
catastrophic events could include a terrorist attack on the united states  or major natural disasters  extreme weather  earthquake  fire  or similar event that affects our central offices  corporate headquarters  network operations center  data centers or network equipment 
we believe that communications infrastructures  such as the one on which we rely  may be vulnerable in the case of such an event  and our markets  which are metropolitan markets  or tier markets  may be more likely to be the targets of terrorist activity 
there is no assurance of profitability in the future 
although we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million and million in and  respectively  and have experienced losses in the past 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will generate positive income in the future 
future losses could require us to slow our growth and make other changes to our business plans  and could result in an increase in our allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances  indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable  include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined  negatively impacting our results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of shares by existing stockholders or issuances of our common stock by us could reduce our stock price 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price of our common stock 
we may also issue shares of our common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments

in addition  we may grant registration rights covering those shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware corporate law might deter acquisition bids for us that our stockholders might consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors  the inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  to act by written consent  to remove any director or the entire board of directors without cause  or to fill any vacancy on the board of directors  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our board of directors is also permitted to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
these provisions and other provisions under delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
because we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
the continued expansion of our business will require substantial funding 
accordingly  we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on shares of our common stock 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  realization of a gain on stockholders investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares

our chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker or codm  also uses our segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses or acquisition related transaction costs  purchase accounting adjustments  gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
our total adjusted ebitda represents the sum of adjusted ebitda for each of our segments 
our total adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
our management uses total adjusted ebitda in its decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with gaap measures such as revenue and income loss from operations 
our calculation of total adjusted ebitda excludes  when applicable non cash share based compensation  loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense  none of which are used by management to assess the operating results and performance of our segments or our consolidated operations  public offering expenses or acquisition related transaction costs  and purchase accounting adjustments  which include the effect on revenue of adjusting acquired deferred revenue balances to fair value as of the respective acquisition date for business acquisitions 
the reduction of the deferred revenue balances affects period to period financial performance comparability and revenue and earnings growth in future periods subsequent to the acquisition and is not indicative of changes in underlying results of operations 

table of contents our management believes that total adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash share based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies 
we provide information relating to our total adjusted ebitda so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our total adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our operating segments ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
in addition  we believe total adjusted ebitda is a useful comparative measure within the communications industry because the industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies  as well as non operating or infrequent charges to earnings  such as the effect of debt restructurings 
accordingly  we believe total adjusted ebitda allows analysts  investors and other interested parties in the communications industry to facilitate company to company comparisons by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
total adjusted ebitda as used in this report may not  however  be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
our calculation of total adjusted ebitda is not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  total adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts  any cash requirements for the replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized  which will often have to be replaced in the future  even though depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  and cash used for business acquisitions 
total adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace operating income loss  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
rather  total adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance to consider in addition to those measures 
because of these limitations  total adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using total adjusted ebitda as a supplemental financial measure 
free cash flow free cash flow represents the cash that a company is able to generate after cash expenses and capital expenditures necessary to maintain or expand its asset base 
we define free cash flow as adjusted ebitda less total capital expenditures 
we believe that free cash flow is an important metric for investors in evaluating how a company is currently using cash generated  and may indicate its ability to generate cash that can potentially be used by the business for capital investments  acquisitions  reduction of debt  payment of dividends  etc 
internally  we have also begun to focus on free cash flow as an important operating performance metric and have designed our corporate bonus compensation plan to utilize free cash flow as a component 
however  we believe that free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  we do not present or manage free cash flow on a segment basis

overview we formed cbeyond and began the development of our network and business processes in early we launched our first market  atlanta  in early and have since expanded operations into additional markets 
during the third quarter of we launched our th market  boston 
as a result of our recent acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements and our ongoing ethernet conversion project see cost of revenue section being implemented throughout our markets  we currently have no plans to expand our operations into any additional markets during we anticipate resuming our market expansion plan of opening new markets beginning in  depending on economic  regulatory and other conditions  and establishing operations in the largest us markets 
additionally  our recent acquisitions and the establishment of our cloud services segment allow us to deliver cloud based services outside of these target markets see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following comprises the historical service launch dates for our current markets collectively we refer to our market based segments as our core managed services current markets service launch date atlanta nd quarter dallas th quarter denver st quarter houston st quarter chicago st quarter los angeles st quarter san diego st quarter detroit rd quarter san francisco bay area th quarter miami st quarter minneapolis nd quarter greater washington dc area st quarter seattle th quarter boston rd quarter we aggregate markets with similar economic characteristics for segment reporting 
this aggregation is consistent with the direction toward which we are increasingly moving and managing the business 
specifically  we recognize that the highest risk stage for a market is in its early stages when we are adapting our strategy and approach to accommodate a new market s unique characteristics  including the small business climate and culture  regulatory conditions  local competitors  and the quality and availability of local employees for staffing and managing the markets 
comparatively  our established markets generally require less frequent direct corporate level management involvement because we have adapted to the local market and have seasoned local management in place  which generally results in more stable operating performance 
as the number of established markets has grown  our codm now spends the majority of his time monitoring the individual performance levels of newer markets and the effectiveness of our corporate operations rather than focusing on individual established markets 
as such  we have aggregated these mature markets as one reportable segment entitled core managed services established markets 

table of contents the markets subject to aggregation are those that we consider established because they have successfully passed through the critical start up phase and  for the reasons mentioned previously  achieved certain operating performance levels 
all other markets and our corporate operations will continue to be presented as separate segments 
currently  a market is considered established upon achieving positive adjusted ebitda for at least four consecutive fiscal quarters and otherwise sharing similar economic characteristics as the other established markets 
as of june  and september   the san francisco and detroit market  respectively  have graduated to the core managed services established market grouping due to their achievement of four consecutive fiscal quarters of positive adjusted ebitda 
we have updated our segment disclosure to retroactively present detroit and san francisco as established markets in the prior period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   our reportable segments were core managed services established markets  the individual core managed services emerging markets including metropolitan miami  minneapolis  the greater washington dc area  seattle and boston  and the cloud services segment 
in the fourth quarter of after making our recent acquisitions  we established the cloud services segment 
we consider the cloud services segment as a reportable segment because the codm is managing the cloud services segment as a separate business unit in terms of resource allocation and financial performance 
specifically we have established resources and executive leadership solely dedicated to integrating our recent acquisitions into an operating arm of the company that will serve new customers in addition to upselling existing customers 
we focus on adjusted ebitda as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business and our reportable segments 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering or acquisition related transaction costs  purchase accounting adjustments  gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
in our presentation of segment financial results  adjusted ebitda for a geographic segment does not include corporate overhead expense and other centralized operating costs 
we believe that adjusted ebitda trends are a valuable indicator of our operating segments relative performance and of whether our operating segments are able to produce sufficient operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
we believe our business approach requires significantly less capital to launch operations compared to traditional communications companies using legacy technologies 
based on our historical experience  over time a substantial majority of our market specific capital expenditures  such as integrated access devices installed at our customers locations  are success based  incurred primarily as our customer base grows 
we believe the success based nature of our capital expenditures mitigates the risk of unprofitable expansion 
we have a relatively low fixed cost component in our budgeted capital expenditures associated with each new market we enter  particularly in comparison to service providers employing time division multiplexing  which is a technique for transmitting multiple channels of separate data  voice and or video signals simultaneously over a single communication medium  or circuit switch technology  which is a switch that establishes a dedicated circuit for the entire duration of a call 
the nature of the primary components of our operating results revenues  cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses are described below revenue we offer integrated managed it and communications services through our beyondvoice packages over high capacity bandwidth connections 
our beyondvoice packages have historically been essentially a single basic product that we offered in three sizes  depending on the customer s size and need for bandwidth 
in march  we began offering our services through beyondvoice packages that were designed to address the customer s business needs rather than the size of the customer 
based on our experience since the introduction of 
table of contents these new packages  we determined that modifications to the packages were appropriate and began making package changes in november and will complete them in the second quarter of these changes essentially combine a business needs approach in different sizes and make mobile service an add on 
as the needs of our customers and the relative market change  we will continue to evolve our integrated service offering packages in the future as appropriate 
in addition to our core beyondvoice packages  through our recent acquisitions we expanded the applications and other offerings we deliver via the cloud  most notably by adding virtual and dedicated servers and cloud pbx services to the suite of products available to our customer base 
in addition  our recent acquisitions bring customers and distribution channels not limited to our traditional geographically concentrated markets 
we expect to make our historic cloud based services  such as virtual receptionist  hosted microsoft exchange  and secure desktop  available through these channels over time as we integrate the acquired operations 
we believe the expansion of our product offering allows us to greatly extend the breadth of services we can deliver to our customers via the web  thus further minimizing or eliminating the need for our customers to invest in complex it infrastructure and resources while increasing our wallet share opportunity and improving our value proposition 
as we continue to focus on and expand our it services utilizing the cloud  we expect to expand our addressable customer market and provide more innovative technology to new and existing customers 
we believe that these acquisitions provide significant growth opportunities  leverage our existing channels of distribution  and expand our innovative technology and expertise 
we anticipate the following benefits to our business entry into a large  high growth cloud services market independent of our beyondvoice product  expansion of product portfolio of it services highly relevant to small businesses  broad geographic opportunity outside cbeyond s existing city footprint  web distribution and private label reseller channels  significant cross selling and up selling opportunities with potential positive impact on our core managed services arpu  opportunity to sell cbeyond s existing cloud based services via the acquired online platform in the future  attractive customer economic model based on server virtualization  new efficient and scalable owned  square foot data center  and extensible platform to provide additional software and infrastructure as a service offerings 
we offer customer promotional incentives in the form of rebates and reimbursements 
these rebates and reimbursements  or promotional obligations  may not ultimately be earned and claimed by customers 
we refer to these unclaimed amounts as breakage 
prior to recording breakage  our promotional obligations are recorded as a reduction of revenue at their maximum amounts due to the lack of sufficient historical experience required to estimate the amount that would ultimately be earned and claimed by customers 
we recognize the benefit of changes to these estimated customer promotional obligations once such amounts are reasonably estimable and then periodically adjust the estimated breakage to actual results  which periodically results in a significant change in estimate 
arpu is impacted by a variety of factors  including introduction of new packages with different pricing  changes in customers demand for certain products or services  changes in customer usage patterns  the proportion of customers signing three year contracts at lower package prices as compared to shorter term contracts  the distribution of customer installations during a period  the use of customer incentives employed when needed to be competitive  as well as fluctuations in terminating access rates 
customer revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 

table of contents access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers represented the remainder of total revenues 
we do not currently include the cloud services segment revenue or the related intercompany segment revenue eliminations to calculate and report arpu as an operating metric 
thus we only utilize core managed services arpu as our revenue metric for our traditional business 
customer revenues are generated under contracts that run up to three year terms 
therefore  customer churn rates have an impact on projected future revenue streams 
through mid  we maintained average monthly churn rates of approximately we define average monthly churn rate as the average of monthly churn  which is defined for a given month as the number of customer locations disconnected in that month divided by the total number of customer locations on our network at the beginning of that month 
since that time  however  we have experienced elevated churn rates that we believe are attributable primarily to the inability of certain of our customers to meet their payment obligations as a result of deteriorated economic conditions or its impact on our target of small business customers  as well as increased competition 
we cannot predict the duration or magnitude of the currently deteriorated economic environment  but we expect our monthly churn rate will continue to be more than for at least as long as the current economic environment persists 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue represents costs directly related to the operation of our network  including payments to the local telephone companies and other communications carriers such as long distance providers and our mobile provider  for access  interconnection and transport fees for voice and internet traffic  customer circuit installation expenses paid to the local telephone companies  fees paid to third party providers of certain applications such as web hosting services  collocation rents and other facility costs  telecommunications related taxes and fees and the cost of mobile handsets 
the primary component of cost of revenue consists of the access fees paid to local telephone companies for high capacity circuits primarily t s to date we lease on a monthly basis to provide connectivity to our customers 
these access circuits link our customers to our network equipment located in a collocation facility  which we lease from local telephone companies 
the access fees for these circuits vary by state and are the primary reason for differences in cost of revenue across our markets 
as a result of the fcc s trro  we are required to lease circuits under special access  or retail  rates in locations that are deemed to offer competitive facilities as outlined in the fcc s regulations and interpreted by the state regulatory agencies 
where permitted by regulation  we lease our access circuits on a wholesale basis as unbundled network element or une loops or enhanced extended links or eel s as provided for under the fcc s telecommunications elemental long run incremental cost rate structure 
where une pricing is not available  we pay special access rates  which may be significantly higher than une pricing 
we lease loops when the customer s t circuit is located where it can be connected to a local telephone company s central office where we have a collocation  and we use eels when we do not have a central office collocation available to serve a customer s t circuit 
historically  approximately half of our circuits are provisioned using loops and half using eels  and the impact of the trro has reduced our usage of the t transport portion of eels and resulted in the conversion and consolidation of a majority of the previously installed t transports to high capacity ds transport 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using loops rather than eels  but loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office collocation equipment 
we install central office collocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch operations in a new market with several collocations and add additional collocation facilities over time as we confirm the most advantageous locations in which to deploy the equipment 
we believe our discipline of leasing these t access circuits on a wholesale basis rather than on the basis of special access rates from the local telephone companies is an important component of our operating cost structure 
in addition  we have begun offering our services using ethernet in place of t circuits in a small number of locations 
although not available to us on a ubiquitous basis in all areas  ethernet technology provides us with the opportunity to offer a large percentage of our customers bandwidth at speeds well in excess of t circuits 
table of contents while potentially reducing our ongoing operating expenses 
while our plans for ethernet deployment are not final  we expect to rapidly increase the number of customers served via ethernet beginning in the first quarter of we currently serve just over of our customers with ethernet but are ramping up our capabilities to process conversions to ethernet and expect to have converted at least one third of our existing customer base by early we expect to incur capital expenditures of up to million through associated with the ethernet conversions and expect to achieve significant access cost savings over time 
another significant component of our cost of revenue is the cost associated with our mobile offering 
these costs include usage based charges  monthly recurring base charges  or some combination thereof  depending on the type of mobile product in service  and the cost of mobile equipment sold to our customers to facilitate their use of our service 
the cost of mobile equipment typically exceeds our selling price of such devices due to the competitive marketplace and pricing practices for mobile services 
we believe these costs are offset over time by the long term profitability of our service contracts 
we routinely receive telecommunication cost recoveries from various local telephone companies to adjust for prior errors in billing  including the effect of price decreases retroactively applied upon the adoption of new rates as mandated by regulatory bodies 
these service credits are often the result of negotiated resolutions of bill disputes that we conduct with our vendors 
we also receive payments from the local telephone companies in the form of performance penalties that are assessed by state regulatory commissions based on the local telephone companies performance in the delivery of circuits and other services that we use in our network 
because of the many factors as noted above that impact the amount and timing of telecommunication cost recoveries  estimating the ultimate outcome of these situations is uncertain 
accordingly  we recognize telecommunication cost recoveries as offsets to cost of revenue when the ultimate resolution and amount are known and verifiable 
these items do not follow any predictable trends and often result in variances when comparing the amounts received over multiple periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for employees and other expenses related to sales and marketing  engineering  information technology  billing  regulatory  administrative  collections and legal and accounting functions 
in addition  share based compensation expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include both fixed and variable costs 
fixed selling expenses include base salaries and office rents 
variable selling costs include commissions  bonuses and marketing materials 
fixed general and administrative costs include the cost of staffing certain corporate overhead functions such as it  marketing  administrative  billing and engineering  and associated costs  such as office rent  legal and accounting fees  property taxes and recruiting costs 
variable general and administrative costs include the cost of provisioning and customer activation staff  which grows with the level of installation of new customers  and the cost of customer care and technical support staff  which grows with the level of total customers on our network 
as we expand into new markets  certain fixed costs are likely to increase  however  these increases are usually intermittent and not proportional with the growth of customers 
reclassifications reclassifications have been made within item herein to the years ended december  and to classify certain adjustments to liabilities of our former captive leasing entities from depreciation and amortization to other income  net 
such reclassifications were made to conform to the current presentation for the year ended december

total revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the average number of core managed services customers and million in revenue from our cloud services segment 
however in comparison to the same periods in  core managed services arpu for the year ended december  declined  or 
the decline in this arpu is primarily due to the lower prices of the new packages introduced in  existing customers converting to lower priced packages  decreased charges for usage above levels of voice minutes included in our packages from customers reducing the number of additional lines and services with incremental charges  and decreased adoption of our mobile services 
we believe these declines are related to the effects of the economic recession on customers and increased competitive pressures 
this downward pressure has been partially offset by the value delivered through selling additional applications 
in addition  we experienced an increase in redemptions of previously issued promotional incentives  which resulted in a reduction to revenue of million  or approximately of core managed services arpu  in the year ended december  this is compared to an increase to revenue of million  or approximately of core managed services arpu  in the year ended december   related to lower redemptions of previously issued promotional incentives 
we believe this change in customer behavior is directly related to the economic environment and competitive pressure 
at this time  we anticipate that our core managed services arpu will continue to decline in the short term for the reasons noted above  however  we also anticipate that our new service packages will decrease the rate of the arpu decline by increasing the arpu for new customers 
long term  we expect the introduction and adoption of the newly acquired cloud based services  as well as new applications and other cloud based it services will benefit arpu 

table of contents revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers have declined for the twelve month comparison periods by approximately million primarily due to a billing dispute filed by a major carrier during the third quarter of which had an overall negative impact on terminating access revenue of approximately million in the year ended december  as we continue to evaluate the dispute and pursue a resolution  we are no longer recognizing the access charge revenue associated with this carrier due to the uncertainty of collectability 
terminating access charges have historically grown at a slower rate than our customer base due to our customers increased use of mobile services and reductions in access rates on interstate calls as mandated by the fcc 
these rate reductions are expected to continue in the future  so we expect terminating access revenue will continue to grow at a rate slower than our customer growth and possibly decline if we are unable to reach a favorable resolution regarding the aforementioned dispute or are presented with other billing disputes

the principal driver of the overall increase in cost of revenue is customer growth  reduced by mobile related cost savings and beneficial telecommunication cost recoveries 
cost of revenue for also includes million related to our cloud services segment 
circuit access fees  or line charges  represent the largest single component of cost of revenue 
these costs primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of collocation to our equipment located at our customers premises 
the increase in circuit access fees has historically correlated to the increase in the number of customers 
however  we have experienced increased costs as we have expanded in certain markets with higher access fees  sold additional bandwidth to existing customers  and incurred transitional costs while migrating customers to ethernet technology 
we expect circuit access fees as a percentage of revenue to stabilize over time as we convert customers to ethernet technology  which we believe will save operating costs in the long term 
the other cost of revenue principally includes components such as long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of transport circuits between network points of presence  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party 
table of contents applications we provide to our customers  access costs paid by us to other carriers to terminate calls from our customers and certain taxes and fees 
other cost of revenue increased as a percentage of revenue over the prior period primarily due to customer growth outpacing revenue growth 
mobile related costs represent the second largest single component of cost of revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  mobile service costs benefitted from a reduction in mobile device cost  which is a result of shipping fewer devices in at a more favorable average cost per device 
the reduction in shipments stems from a lower percentage of new customers electing to include mobile services in their package  primarily due to a reduction in our use of promotional and other incentives 
additionally  we have been able to negotiate and achieve more efficient unit service costs 
we do not currently anticipate significant changes in the percentage of customers using our mobile service in the future 
telecommunication cost recoveries are an ongoing operational activity that fluctuate from period to period 
during the year ended december   telecommunication cost recoveries increased million due to trro related cost recoveries  cost recoveries from negotiated resolutions of billing disputes with our telecommunication vendors across various markets  and performance penalties received from local telephone companies

selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increased employee costs  but decreased as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  due to lower commission payments  lower share based compensation expense  a decrease in bad debt expense  greater overall cost control measures  and government incentives of approximately million attributable to new jobs created during and higher employee costs  which include salaries  wages  benefits and other compensation paid to our direct sales representatives and sales agents  principally relate to the additional employees necessary to staff new markets and to serve the growth in customers 
total selling  general and administrative expenses also includes million of additional expenses from our new cloud services segment in the year ended december  
table of contents share based compensation expense decreased as a percentage of revenue and overall from the prior year  primarily related to a lower stock price in recent years 
marketing costs have been stable as a percent of revenues over the prior year 
in general  our marketing costs will increase consistent with past practice as we add customers and expand into new markets 
additionally  we expect higher marketing costs in as we promote our new cloud services segment and market the service to new and existing customers 
other selling  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes and bad debt expense 
the increase in this category of costs is primarily due to the addition of new and expanded operations needed to keep pace with the growth in customers 
the stability as a percentage of revenue is partially attributable to improved bad debt expense over the prior year 
bad debt expense was million  or of core managed services revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decline is primarily driven by our decreased core managed services customer churn rate since typically the rate of bad debts and customer churn are closely related 
other operating expenses include transaction costs  and depreciation and amortization 
transaction costs include accounting  legal  consulting and other directly related professional fees associated with our recent cloud services acquisitions 
the increase in depreciation and amortization over the prior year relates primarily to capital expenditures  million of depreciation and amortization from assets acquired through the recent cloud services acquisitions  and  a million write down of assets related to the buildout of collocations in a planned new market prior to our decision in mid december not to expand into this market in over time  as newer markets become established and as our customer base and revenues grow  we expect selling  general and administrative costs to continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
this trend is also expected when slowing the speed of market expansion  and as more markets achieve positive adjusted ebitda results  as experienced in the current periods over the prior periods 
since such costs increase relative to customer growth  however  efficiency gains as a percentage of revenue are adversely impacted by declining arpu  as illustrated by a decline of in sg a costs per average core managed services customer compared to only a marginal improvement in sg a costs relative to revenues 
in addition  transaction costs related to acquisitions or financing activities may adversely affect selling  general and administrative costs in the short term 
operating loss for the year ended december   our operating loss was million compared to an operating loss of million for the comparable period ended december  substantially all of the operating loss was generated in the fourth quarter  which reflects the incurrence of approximately million in costs associated with our ethernet conversion project  million of transaction costs from our cloud services acquisitions  and million in asset write offs from abandoning a planned market launch 
the remaining fourth quarter operating loss resulted primarily from the decline in core managed services arpu 
the overall improvement in operating loss from to is principally attributable to achieving greater scale in our emerging markets 
we had nine markets with operating income during the year ended december   compared to seven markets for the comparable period ended december  additionally  the reduction in mobile related device and service costs has also contributed to the decreased operating loss in 
table of contents other income expense and income taxes dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change from previous periods dollars of revenue dollars of revenue dollars percent interest income nm nm interest expense nm other income  net income tax expense benefit total    nm interest income 
we had insignificant interest income for the year ended december  based on our decision to shift funds from investment to non interest bearing operating bank accounts 
this decision was made because the resulting reduction in bank fees was greater than the amount of interest income we would have earned due to the low rates currently paid on our money market investments 
interest expense 
the majority of our interest expense for the years ended december  and relates to commitment fees under our revolving credit facility with our creditor  and were higher in due to increasing our credit facility from million to million early in to a lesser extent  we have also recorded interest expense associated with contingent purchase consideration payable in the future for our recent acquisitions 
during years ended december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
other income  net 
other income  net relates primarily to adjusting liabilities of our former captive leasing subsidiaries upon the expiration of various statutory periods  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of income  compared to less than million for the comparable period ended december  income tax expense benefit 
in we recorded income tax expense despite having a pre tax loss of million due to income taxes in states with gross receipts based taxes  which are due regardless of profit levels  and the write off of certain deferred tax assets associated with share based transactions discussed more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we recorded an income tax benefit in on a pre tax loss of million in in  we incurred gross receipts based state income taxes as well  but  due to the higher loss before income taxes  they were offset by the effect of the income tax benefit for federal and other non gross receipts based state taxes 
since gross receipts based taxes are not dependent upon levels of pre tax income and because we are near break even at a pre tax level  these taxes have a significant influence on our effective tax rate 
as the operating results for the markets in these states become proportionately less significant to the consolidated results and as consolidated pre tax income increases  the impact of these gross receipts based taxes on our effective tax rate will decline 
the income tax amounts recorded in and benefitted from reductions in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million in each year 
income tax expense for also included activity related to acquisitions made in  which is discussed more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  and primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards 
in order to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets of million recognized at december   we will need to generate approximately million in pre tax income by the end of  which  based on current projected performance  management expects to be able to meet 
the majority of pre tax income is projected to occur in and  with projected to be near break even 
the results are significantly impacted by the expenses 
table of contents associated with the ethernet conversion project and our integration of the cloud services segment  both of which have a significant favorable impact on projected and results 
if future results are less favorable than our projections or if the projected benefits of our investments fall short of our expectations  we may have to increase our allowance against our net deferred tax asset with a corresponding increase to income tax expense 
if we generate taxable income in excess of projections  the result would be a further reduction of the allowance against our net deferred tax asset and a corresponding benefit to income tax expense

total revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers 
however  core managed arpu  or arpu declined or compared to  with the most significant decline occurring during the fourth quarter of where arpu declined to  or approximately lower than the same period in the decline in arpu in was primarily due to increases in the impact of credits and promotional incentives issued to new customers or to retain existing customers  contract renewals at lower base prices and decreased overage charges stemming from lower levels of voice minutes used in excess of minutes included within our base package 
we believe these declines were related to the effects of the economic recession on customers and increased competitive pressures 
this downward pressure has been partially offset by an increase in the average applications used per customer to in the period ended december  from in the period ended december  in addition  we recognized benefits related to reductions to promotional obligations of million and million both equating to approximately of arpu in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to certain customer promotional liabilities recorded in prior periods 

table of contents revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers increased for the twelve month comparison periods due to our customer growth but have declined as a percentage of arpu

the principal driver of the increase in cost of revenue is customer growth 
in addition  between and  we experienced an increase in both the number of mobile handsets sold and the related mobile service costs 
these mobile related increases grew at a higher rate than our overall customer growth due to a higher proportion of our customers receiving our mobile services in than in  driven by both successful marketing of our beyondmobile service to our existing customer base and a high mobile adoption rate for new customers 
circuit access fees  or line charges  represent the largest single component of cost of revenue 
these costs primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of collocation to our equipment located at our customers premises 
the increase in circuit access fees is mainly correlated to the increase in the number of customers 
mobile related costs include monthly recurring base charges or usage based charges  depending on the type of mobile product in service  and the cost of mobile equipment sold to our customers to facilitate their use of our service 
these increased monthly recurring mobile service costs have been partially offset by declining per unit rates charged to us by our underlying mobile network provider due to our growing scale and volumes

telecommunication cost recoveries are an ongoing operational activity that fluctuates from period to period  with occasional transactions that result in benefits that are atypical

to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time  we may have significant cash in our operating accounts with third party financial institutions that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
we have a corporate banking relationship with bank of america  n 
a or bank of america 
cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows increased primarily from increased revenues along with a higher number of markets that are achieving positive operating cash flows in and a narrowing of the losses we are incurring in earlier stage markets as they make progress towards profitability 
furthermore as evident in our bad debt expense reduction  collection of accounts receivable has improved in the current year period compared to the prior year period  which is driving million of positive cash flow increase over the prior year 
we have also experienced cash flow savings from decreasing our inventory purchases as we have a lower percentage of new customers electing to include mobile services in their package 
additionally  as noted below we paid million of accrued telecommunication cost settlement in  with no comparable settlements in these increased operating cash flows were partially offset by higher annual bonus payments made in the current period as well as cash used in and to support our newer markets that do not yet generate positive cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows will also fluctuate favorably or unfavorably depending on the timing of significant vendor payments 
operating cash flows increased during the year ended december  from the comparable period in by million  or 
operating cash flows increased primarily from increased revenues along with an increased number of sales markets that are achieving positive operating cash flows in these increased operating cash flows were partially offset by additional payments to suppliers and vendors to support these revenues during the year ended december  the increased cash flows from increased revenues were also partially offset by cash used in and to support our newer markets that do not yet generate positive cash flows from operations  as well as those markets we are preparing to launch 
operating cash provided in includes million in lower annual bonuses and other annual compensation payments in as compared to  as well as settlements in and and payments of approximately million and million related to accrued telecommunication costs from earlier periods that had been in dispute  respectively 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities 
our principal cash investments are purchases of property and equipment  which fluctuate depending on growth in customers in our existing markets  the timing and number of facility and network additions needed to support our entry into new markets  expand existing markets and upgrade our network  enhancements and development costs related to our operational support systems in order to offer additional applications and services to our customers  and increases to the capacity of our data centers as our customer base and the breadth of our product portfolio expand 
in addition  we have made initial investments in the deployment of ethernet technology to reduce operating expenses and enable the provision of higher bandwidth services to our customers  and we expect to increase our ethernet investment in future periods 
we believe that capital efficiency is a key advantage of the ip based network technology that we employ 
our cash purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we also incurred non cash purchases of property and equipment  primarily related to leasehold improvements  which was million  million and million in the  and  respectively 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we closed our cloud services acquisitions and paid closing date consideration of million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we expect to pay up to an additional million of contingent consideration related to these acquisitions in and cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows provided by or used in financing activities for all periods presented relate to activity associated with employee stock option exercises and vesting of restricted shares 
we believe that cash on hand plus cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  operating expenses and other cash requirements associated with our future market expansion plan  depending on economic  regulatory and other conditions 
macroeconomic conditions are expected to continue to have an impact on our cash flows and customer churn rate 
our business plan assumes that cash flow from operating activities of our established markets will offset the negative cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities with respect to the additional markets we plan to launch 
however  due to our recent acquisitions and our ethernet conversion project  we do not intend to open a new market in and plan to resume our market expansion plan in we intend to adhere to our policy of fully funding all future market expansions in advance and do not anticipate entering markets without having more than sufficient cash on hand or borrowing capacity to cover projected cash needs 
we believe that cash on hand is more than sufficient to fund normal operations in and beyond  including our ethernet conversion project and our investment in the cloud services business 
depending on the speed of conversions  opportunities for increased conversions  and the potential for acceleration of the growth rate in cloud services  it is possible that our cash outflows for these investments may not coincide on a short term basis with cash inflows 
in such a circumstance  we may consider it prudent to temporarily draw against our line of credit facility 
further  while we do not anticipate a need for additional access to capital or new financing aside from our line of credit facility in the near term  we monitor the capital markets and may access those markets if our business prospects or plans change resulting in a need for additional capital  or if additional capital that may be needed can be obtained on favorable terms

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  those discussed below involved a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are therefore considered critical 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition 
our marketing promotions include various rebates and customer reimbursements that fall under the scope of asc  multiple arrangements  and asc  customer payments incentives 
in accordance with these pronouncements  we record these promotions as a reduction in revenue when earned by the customer 
when these promotions are earned over time  we ratably allocate the cost of honoring the promotions over the underlying promotion period as a reduction in revenue 
asc also requires that measurement of the obligation should be based on the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the promotion 
accordingly  we recognize the benefit of estimated breakage on customer promotions when such amounts are reasonably estimable 
property  equipment and other long lived assets 
we utilize significant amounts of property and equipment in providing services to our customers 
we use straight line depreciation for property  equipment  and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the lease or estimated useful lives 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property and equipment may cause the estimated useful life or the value of these assets to change 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated economic useful lives for each category of property and equipment 
periodically we assess potential impairment of our property and equipment 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and significant industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
we recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset 
software development 
we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of certain internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus resulting in capitalization 
all other software development costs are expensed as incurred 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over estimated useful lives of the software 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill  which consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired  will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis on october  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  we will first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step will be performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we will estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination 
we will evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
as was the initial year that goodwill was recorded  we will begin our annual impairment analysis as of october  intangible assets  including developed technology  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names arising principally from acquisitions  are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 
there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing  including an estimate of future expected revenue  earnings and cash flows  and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of an asset 
contingencies 
we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts through charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the allowance is established based upon the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and is estimated based on a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience and the general economic environment 
customer accounts are typically written off against the allowance approximately sixty to ninety days after disconnection of the customers service  when our direct collection efforts cease 
generally  customer accounts are considered delinquent and the service disconnection process begins when they are sixty days in arrears 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of our expenses could result 
share based compensation 
in accordance with asc  stock compensation  we account for shared based compensation expense using the fair value recognition provisions of asc share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award as calculated by the lattice binomial option pricing model and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  after estimating the effect of forfeitures 
option valuation models involve input assumptions that are subjective  and hence  may result in option value that is not equal to that of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller 
additionally  estimated forfeiture rates assumptions are based on historical rates  and may not be indicative of future forfeiture behavior 

table of contents valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
we made assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and  allowable deductions 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws could materially impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual consolidated operating results and the underlying amount and category of income or loss in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset is designed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards for information about recently issued accounting standards  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
at december   all cash and cash equivalents that are held in money market funds invest primarily in short term us treasury obligations and are immediately available cash balances 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk primarily relates to changes in interest rates received on our investment in money market funds and immediately available cash 
management estimates that if the average yield of our investments changed by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have changed by less than million 
this estimate assumes that the change occurred on the first day of and that all cash and cash equivalents are held in money market funds 
however as of december   the majority of our cash is held in operating bank accounts 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on our total investments
