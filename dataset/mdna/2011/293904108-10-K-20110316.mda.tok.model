item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on february   we issued a press release reporting our full year operating results 
we reported a loss from continuing operations of million  income and gain from discontinued operations of million and net income of million  and per share  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of the year end reporting process and subsequent to the aforementioned earnings release  we corrected two entries related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
because the sale of substantially all of the net assets of our canadian subsidiary constituted a substantial liquidation of that entity for accounting purposes  we should have credited the gain on the sale for the million of currency translation gains residing in accumulated other comprehensive income related to our canadian operations 
the correcting entry increased the gain on the sale from million to million or per share 
additionally  because the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business constituted a fundamental change as defined in the indenture to our notes  an enhanced conversion rate became effective which caused a number of our note holders to convert their notes to shares of our common stock 
the net effect of forgone interest and the write off of deferred debt issuance costs amounting to million was charged to earnings during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter reporting process  we determined that this amount should have been charged to additional paid in capital 
the correcting adjustment  also made subsequent to the earnings release  had the effect of reducing our loss from continuing operations for the year to million or per share 
the combined effect of these two entries was to increase net income by million to million or per share 
these two entries are not considered material to either the first or fourth quarters of nor to the full year results of operations and were recorded as fourth quarter adjustments 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company dedicated to the research and development of innovative therapeutics for cancer patients with high unmet medical needs 
we are managed as a single operating unit 
our drug development programs utilize two platforms customized pegylation linker technology customized linker technology and third generation mrna targeting agents utilizing the locked nucleic acid lna technology 
we currently have four compounds in human clinical development  peg sn and the antagonists of hypoxia inducible factor a hif a  survivin and androgen receptor ar 
in addition we have multiple novel lna targets in various stages of preclinical research 
we receive royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies related to sales of products developed using our proprietary customized linker technology primarily pegintron marketed by merck co  inc merck 
in order to better focus on our portfolio of innovative oncology programs  we divested our specialty pharmaceutical business comprised principally of what had previously been our products and contract manufacturing segments 
prior to the january  closing of the transaction  we were a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development  manufacture and commercialization of medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions 
we operated in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
we had a portfolio of four marketed products  oncaspar  for first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all  depocyt  for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  abelcet  for the treatment of invasive fungal infections  and adagen  for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease 
the contract manufacturing business involved the manufacture of products for other pharmaceutical companies 
the products and contract manufacturing segments constituted components of our business and the sale qualified for treatment as discontinued operations effective with the first quarter of accordingly  the operations and cash flows of the products and contract manufacturing segments have been eliminated from our reported continuing operations and have been classified as discontinued operations beginning in prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
similarly  assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmaceutical business are presented separately in our balance sheets 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business also involved the sale of certain in process research and development associated with the divested products  the potential receipt of certain contingent milestone payments  the potential receipt of certain royalties and our provision of various transitional services to the purchaser 
each of these aspects of the transaction is discussed below in greater detail 
throughout the majority of management s discussion and analysis  the focus is on the results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future outlook of our continuing operations 
the percentage changes throughout the discussion that follows are based on amounts stated in thousands of dollars and not the rounded millions of dollars reflected in this section 
results of continuing operations millions of dollars year ended december  revenues royalties sale of in process research and development contract research and development miscellaneous income total revenues operating expenses research and development pipeline research and development specialty and contracted services general and administrative general and administrative contracted services restructuring charge operating loss other income expense income tax benefit provision loss from continuing operations overview the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in january had numerous effects on our financial results making year to year comparisons and inferences regarding future trends difficult 
even after reclassifying the majority of revenues and expenses of the divested business as discontinued operations  several large and unique items remain that are reported as part of continuing operations but that are not expected to be recurring events 
in addition  indirectly related to the divestiture was the restructuring charge incurred in to summarize the unique items related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business the sale of in process research and development for million was part of the total sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business but is reported as part of continuing operations because we continue to operate as a research and development organization 
revenues from a transition services agreement entered into with the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business totaling million contract research and development and the majority of miscellaneous income are expected to significantly diminish in contracted services in largely represent the expenses incurred million in support of the transition services revenues mentioned above and also are expected to diminish significantly in also in this caption are the expenses incurred by us prior to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in support of the products we owned at that time million in  million in and million in 
after taking these items and the million restructuring charges into account  analysis of the underlying trends we have experienced in royalty revenues  research and development spending and general and administrative expenses is enhanced 
these and other elements of our statements of operations are discussed more fully below 
royalty revenues millions of dollars year ended december  change change royalty revenue the majority of royalty revenue relates to sales of pegintron  a peg enhanced version of the alpha interferon product  intron a  marketed by merck formerly schering plough  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
other royalty revenues and certain licensing revenues relate to the application of our technology to third party products including those under a cross license agreement with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar under which we receive a share of the royalties and licensing income received by nektar 
there are currently two third party products for which nektar has granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology and for which we are participating in royalty and licensing income revenues ucb s cimzia for the treatment of crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis in the european union and osi and pfizer s macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration 
there were previously three products for which nektar had granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology  but our right to receive royalties on sales of pegasys ended  by contract  effective in october royalty revenue declined approximately percent in compared to this was primarily the result of declining sales of pegintron which were percent lower during the relevant period of comparison 
further contributing to the full year decline was the absence of royalties from pegasys in  partially offset by growth in sales of cimzia 
macugen royalties were flat for the year 
also during  we recognized for the first time royalties earned on net sales of products we divested as part of the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
we are entitled to royalties of to percent on incremental net sales through by the purchaser above a baseline amount from the four marketed specialty pharmaceutical products we sold to them 
there can be no assurance that any additional royalty revenues related to these products will accrue to us 
certain specific royalty rights related to sales of oncaspar in europe by other companies were divested as part of the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
the revenues generated from these contracts totaling approximately million and million in and  respectively  are not reflected above but are reflected in discontinued operations 
for  we experienced a year over year decline in royalty revenues of approximately percent 
royalty revenues from pegintron pegylated interferon sales were down percent compared to levels due in part to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange variances and  in part  to lower sales in the us and internationally 
royalties from pegasys  cimzia and macugen also decreased in compared to cimzia was approved for sale in april for crohn s disease and in may for rheumatoid arthritis 
macugen continued to experience competition 
our future revenues are heavily weighted towards royalties and revenues to be received from the use of our technology and are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control 
sales of pegintron have been in decline since there are a number of new therapies in late stage development that could significantly erode the market for pegylated interferon which  in combination with the generic antiviral pill  ribavirin  represents the current standard of care 
the most advanced new therapies are protease inhibitors that work by blocking the action of the protease enzyme the hepatitis virus needs to replicate 
studies have revealed that the triple combinations pegylated interferon  ribavirin and protease inhibitor are very effective in significantly reducing the hepatitis virus  and may allow shorter course of therapy  which may be better tolerated by patients 
these studies have not exclusively involved pegintron  however 
many of the studies have involved pegasys  the other currently available form of pegylated interferon  from which we no longer derive royalties 
there has been some indication that a significant number of patients suffering from hepatitis c may be deferring treatment until the new therapies become available potentially as early as mid the implications of the unsettled hepatitis c market to future sales of pegintron are not clear 
merck s obligation to pay us royalties on sales of pegintron terminates  on a country by country basis  upon the later of the date the last patent to contain a claim covering pegintron expires in the country or years after the first commercial sale of pegintron in such country 
currently  expirations of our right to receive royalties are expected to occur in in the us  in europe and in japan 
other factors potentially affecting our royalty revenues include new or increased competition from products that may compete with the products for which we receive royalties  the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees and new uses and geographies for pegintron  cimzia and macugen 
our rights to receive royalties on cimzia and macugen will terminate in in  we sold a percent interest in pegintron royalties 
accordingly  amounts reflected above represent our percent share of total royalties remitted by merck 
the purchaser of the percent royalty interest we sold will be obligated to pay an additional million to us in the first quarter of if it achieves a certain threshold level of royalties on sales of pegintron occurring from july  through december  the million contingent gain will be recognized when and if the contingency is removed and collection is assured 
it presently appears unlikely that the necessary sales threshold will be attained 
non us revenue we recognized royalties on non us sales of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which royalties recognized on sales in europe were million  million and million  respectively 
our non us royalties are denominated in non us dollars and are included in total revenues 
sale of in process research and development when we sold our specialty pharmaceutical business  we retained our research and development organization 
we had been engaged in studies oriented towards the next generation formulations of oncaspar and adagen  two products that were among those sold as part of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
the in process research and development related to oncaspar and adagen was sold to the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business and million was recognized as revenue in connection with the sale in the first quarter of the selling price of the in process research and development represented management s best estimate of its standalone fair value based on the stage of development and future milestone payment consideration 
all necessary technology and know how were transferred to the purchaser at the time of the sale and the purchaser could resell the in process research and development asset 
at the time of the sale  the activities necessary to complete the work on the oncaspar and adagen next generation formulations could have been performed by the purchaser or others 
contract research and development revenue pursuant to a transition services agreement entered into at the time of the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business  we began performing product support research and development  consulting and technology transfer functions for the purchaser effective with the close of the sale transaction on january  the transition services associated with product support research and development are being reported in continuing operations due to our ongoing involvement in the research and development related to the divested products 
we are being compensated for this work at actual cost plus a mark up per the terms of the transition services agreement 
revenue was generated from these services in the amount of million for the year ended december  our contractual obligation is to assist with these transition services for a period of up to three years subsequent to the date of the sale although we anticipate the level of such activity to decline significantly from levels 
miscellaneous income as part of the transition services agreement referred to above  we are being compensated for various general and administrative services provided to the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
the compensation for this work includes reimbursement of costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the agreement 
through december   approximately million has been earned for these services 
the expenses incurred in relation to these services are reported as general and administrative contracted services 
our involvement in the transitioning of general and administrative activities is nearly complete 
also reflected in miscellaneous income are rental receipts totaling approximately million in connection with the sublease of unused manufacturing and excess office facilities for which we have ongoing lease commitments 
the underlying rental expense is reflected in general and administrative expense 
research and development expenses pipeline millions of dollars year ended december  change change research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of contractor fees principally related to clinical projects  costs related to research and development collaborations or licenses  drug supplies for preclinical and clinical activities  salaries and share based compensation and benefits  as well as other research supplies and facilities charges 
the following table summarizes our major pipeline research and development projects  the costs incurred for the years ended december   and and the current phases of development millions of dollars for the year ended december  current phase of development program costs peg sn phases i and ii hif a antagonist phase i survivin antagonist phase i androgen receptor antagonist ind accepted additional lna targets preclinical pegylation technology research preclinical other costs total program costs for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased percent to million 
we invested in the following programs during peg sn spending on peg sn increased significantly in as phase ii clinical activity increased in the metastatic colorectal cancer study and we initiated a phase ii study in metastatic breast cancer and a phase i pediatric study 
we continued to conduct a phase ii trial for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
this study is designed to evaluate two groups of colorectal patients who have failed two prior therapies including irinotecan and oxaliplatin  those with k ras mutation and those that have non mutated k ras tumors 
the study is expected to enroll approximately patients and enrollment is expected to be completed in the non mutated k ras group is randomized into two arms  one treated with peg sn in combination with erbitux and the other arm treated with irinotecan in combination with erbitux 
in january  we started enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for patients with metastatic breast cancer 
the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of single agent peg sn in two groups of patients who have received prior therapy regimens of anthracycline and taxane or anthracycline  taxane and xeloda 
irinotecan has been evaluated and shown to be active in patients with breast cancer 
all patients will be treated with single agent peg sn enrollment in the metastatic breast cancer study is expected to be completed in we also started enrollment in february in our phase i study for pediatric patients with cancer 
this study is designed to find the recommended dose of peg sn in pediatric patients 
we expect to complete this phase i study in furthermore  we have opened a phase i study of peg sn and bevacizumab at the national cancer institute  bethesda  md  in patients who failed multiple prior chemotherapy regimens 
hif a antagonist on a comparative basis  spending was substantially lower in on hif a than in this was due primarily to elevated costs experienced in for the production of clinical trial supplies 
we continued to conduct two phase i studies in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma to evaluate the safety of the hif a antagonist using two different dosing schedules 
we continue to enroll patients on a weekly schedule 
in general  hif a antagonist therapy has been well tolerated  and many patients have received multiple cycles 
we have observed stable disease in a number of patients treated with our hif a antagonist 
tumor shrinkage also was seen in patients with renal cell cancer  liver cancer  sarcoma  and cancer of the tonsil 
patients enrolled in were required to get repeated biopsies of cancer tumors once biological activity was shown and higher doses were being given 
we expect study completion in furthermore  we have opened a pilot study in patients with liver cancer at the national cancer institute 
survivin antagonist spending on survivin in included a million milestone payment and the costs of production of clinical trial supplies 
comparable milestone payments and expenses of producing clinical trial materials were not incurred in we continued to enroll patients in our phase i study 
the study is designed to first treat patients with survivin as a single agent until progression at which time the patient s treatment will be changed to survivin in combination with taxotere 
this allows us to gain dose and safety information both as a single agent and in combination in one phase i study 
in collaboration with a pediatric phase i consortium therapeutic advances in childhood leukemia lymphoma  we opened an investigator initiated study in patients with relapsed all 
androgen receptor ar antagonist spending on ar accelerated during as enabling activities related to an investigational new drug ind were conducted 
this included toxicology and preclinical work that led to the filing and subsequent acceptance on an ind application in november in connection with the filing  we made a million milestone payment to santaris in the fourth quarter of additional lna targets under our agreement with santaris we will have the right to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against additional novel oncology gene targets selected by us 
we are evaluating these compounds in early preclinical studies 
any one of these compounds could be returned to santaris if the findings of our preclinical or clinical work do not support continued investigation 
in  we incurred milestone payments totaling million for the commencement of preclinical studies for three of our targets in addition to the million milestone payment for the ar antagonist ind referred to above 
in  there were no such early stage milestone payments 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased approximately percent to million 
we invested in the following programs during peg sn we conducted two phase i clinical trials with peg sn in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas who had been extensively treated with and progressed on other chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate different dosing schedules for peg sn these trials completed enrollment in the second quarter of in june  we started enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
hif a antagonist we continued to conduct two phase i studies in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma to evaluate the safety of the hif a antagonist using two different dosing schedules 
we enrolled patients on a weekly and a daily schedule 
we commenced production of clinical trial supplies during resulting in an increase in expense 
survivin antagonist the ind application for our survivin antagonist was accepted by the fda in february we opened and started enrolling patients in a phase i study 
a million milestone payment was made and significant expense was incurred in the production of clinical trial materials 
ar antagonist we advanced the ar lna to the preclinical development stage and initiated ind enabling studies 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a million milestone for the commencement of preclinical activities for ar 
additional lna targets there were no milestone payments in for targets not specifically referred to above  whereas in  million of milestone payments for early stage targets were made 
research and development specialty and contracted services expenses associated with generating contract research and development revenue amounted to million in also reflected in this line caption are the costs we incurred from january through january  and the full years and in our research and development activities related to the marketed products we owned during those periods 
this work was directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in the production of oncaspar and adagen  including development of new formulations of each 
prior to the sale of the business  we incurred million in support of the marketed products 
during the years ended december  and  million and million were expensed on marketed products 
general and administrative expenses millions of dollars year ended december  change change general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  salaries and benefits for support functions  patent filing fees and facilities costs 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  down percent from the prior year 
the reduction from the preceding year was largely the result of ongoing cost containment efforts and the contraction of corporate services and overhead costs necessitated by the first quarter sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
a significant portion of the year over year decrease is related to compensation 
the restructuring program implemented during the first quarter of and the resulting reduction in employees was reflected in lower payroll costs during the latter half of the year 
the december restructuring will have a favorable effect on expense 
accelerated vesting of share based awards effected in the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction in of the charges related to the vesting of these awards for all but certain senior management and board members 
offsetting these favorable influences on compensation expense in  in part  was the shift of a portion of the executive bonus expense recognition out of and into a fourth quarter adjustment was made to annual executive bonuses paying them one half in cash and one half in nonvested shares that vested over the twelve months of in addition to reductions in compensation expenses  we also made concerted efforts to reduce contracted services  accounting and consulting fees in during  certain general and administrative expenses were elevated  including legal costs related to a proposed shareholder consent solicitation and the post implementation costs of an enterprise resource planning erp computer software system 
as outlined above  we have made significant progress in reducing general and administrative expenses and will continue to seek and implement efficiencies that could potentially lead to further reductions 
however  the rate of improvement experienced during is not expected to continue 
we may experience additional charges associated with the south plainfield lease or its termination prior to its contractual expiration in october general and administrative spending decreased percent to million in from million in both years expenses included certain costs associated with strategic initiatives million in and million in 
these initiatives related to preparations during to sell the specialty pharmaceutical business and analysis of various alternatives during general and administrative spending was lower in  compared to  due in part to the benefits derived from the first quarter restructuring 
in addition  a fourth quarter adjustment was made to annual executive bonuses and a decision was made to satisfy these bonuses one half in cash and one half in nonvested shares that vested over the twelve months of the effect of this was to reduce compensation expense and defer it to offsetting these improvements were the cost of certain organizational and administrative enhancements  including the establishment of a business development function and the post implementation costs of a newly developed erp computer software system 
in addition  costs associated with the site at south plainfield  new jersey began to be recognized in general and administrative expense in when production activities at the south plainfield location ceased in late  costs such as security  utilities  insurance and monthly rental were classified as general and administrative 
general and administrative contracted services as part of the transition services agreement with the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business  we provided certain general  administrative  financial  legal  human resource and information technology services for a period of up to one year 
we were compensated for these services based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
during the year ended december   expenses associated with generating this revenue were approximately million 
this administrative support activity has nearly ended 
restructuring as part of our continued efforts to streamline operations  we undertook reductions in our workforce during the first and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of we also incurred charges related to our sublease of a portion of our excess leased office space at our corporate location and the write off of certain furnishings and leasehold improvements 
we incurred the following costs in connection with our restructuring programs during the years ended december  and there were no restructuring charges related to continuing operations in millions of dollars year ended december  employee separation benefits first quarter program fourth quarter program program other restructuring charge there were two major restructurings initiated during  both of which reflected the transition of the company from a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with research  manufacturing and marketing operations to a biotechnology company dedicated to oncology research and development 
during the first quarter of  a workforce reduction involving employees was announced resulting in an expense of million for separation costs for the affected employees 
these actions related primarily to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business including several employees who were previously engaged in activities related to the divested business but who did not transfer to the employment of the purchaser 
these employees were provided with separation benefits after certain transition periods during which they assisted with an orderly transfer of activities and information to the purchaser 
also  effective february   our then president and chief executive officer  resigned from the company 
for the quarter ended march   we expensed million for severance payments and benefits that were payable to the individual per the terms of his employment agreement 
this amount was reduced during the quarter ended june  by approximately million once the termination agreement was executed 
employees affected by the fourth quarter restructuring were notified in december this restructuring program was part of our continued efforts to streamline corporate administrative operations 
the majority of the terminations will occur during the first quarter of and separation payments totaling million will be made for up to a year following the respective terminations 
the portion of the combined restructuring expense to be paid out in the next twelve months million is reported as a current liability in accrued expenses as of december  the remainder is reported as an other liability million 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off certain leasehold improvements and furnishings located at our then corporate headquarters in bridgewater  new jersey that were determined to be excess and without future value as a result of the termination and relocation of several employees 
the noncash charge related to this write off was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for a portion of our excess corporate facilities 
these facilities became unused as a result of the reductions in workforce stemming from earlier restructuring efforts 
the charge of approximately million represents the excess of our contractual lease commitment over the amount of cash to be received from the subtenant over the life of the sublease arrangement 
by the end of the first quarter of  we expect to have completed the relocation of our corporate offices to piscataway  new jersey 
the vacating of the excess office space in bridgewater will likely trigger a further restructuring charge in for the excess of committed lease costs over anticipated sublease income 
corporate restructuring costs associated with the workforce reduction amounted to million during the first quarter of this represents separation benefits and related costs of terminated employees in general and administrative areas as well as research and development 
the payments related to this charge were completed within the year and no accruals remained as of december  other income expense millions of dollars year ended december  change change other income expense investment income  net interest expense other than temporary investment impairment loss nm nm other  net nm not meaningful net other income expense for the three years ended december   and was expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the repurchase and conversion of a portion of our notes and the repurchase and retirement of the remaining notes during the three year period affected the year to year comparisons in a number of ways see liquidity and capital resources below 
also  in  two significant items that tended to offset one another were the recognition of an impairment in an investment holding and recognition of an award of a government grant 
further discussion of each of the individual items follows 
net investment income in was lower than that of by million and in it was lower than in by approximately million 
this was due to reductions in the amount of investment holdings and  in general  reductions in the rates of return being earned 
during  as investments matured  the proceeds were placed in money market funds 
proceeds from a portion of our investment holdings were used to repurchase notes payable in amounts of million in and million in interest expense includes amortization and  when debt is repurchased  write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense has declined over the three year period through  to million in from million in and from million in the reduction in was due primarily to the conversion in the first quarter of the year of million principal amount of our notes into shares of our common stock in connection with the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
reductions in interest expense in related to the repurchases of the notes in and referred to above and repayment of the balance of our notes in july million principal amount 
the write off of deferred debt issuance costs was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment losses on available for sale investment holdings representing credit losses are charged to earnings 
we hold an investment in one auction rate security that we believe is more likely than not impaired due to the lack of credit worthiness of the issuer and its parent company 
consequently  the remaining carrying value of million was written off during the third quarter of in  we wrote the investment down by million based upon information available at that time 
other income in is primarily the receipt of a million federal government grant for qualifying therapeutic discovery investments made by us in and the majority of the funds were received in december while approximately million remained receivable as of december  significant portions of other income in and relate to gains realized on the repurchase of notes payable 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes at a discount to par yielding a gross gain of million 
in  we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes at a discount to par yielding a gross gain of approximately million 
we also repurchased a portion of our notes early in at a gross gain of million 
losses related to asset disposals and foreign exchange partially offset the gains on repurchase of notes payable 
in each case  the gross gains reflected here are exclusive of the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
discontinued operations the cash proceeds received from the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business  including a second quarter working capital adjustment  amounted to approximately million 
of this amount  million was allocated to the sale of in process research and development and included in continuing operations 
the net proceeds then attributable to discontinued operations yielded a gain of million 
the results of operations of the specialty pharmaceutical business for the period in january preceding the sale amounted to income of million comprising the remainder of the reported in as income and gain from discontinued operations 
although the sale was a taxable event  no tax liability arose due to the basis we had in the underlying assets and the current year net operating loss 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we also were entitled to receive up to an additional million if certain milestones are met 
of this amount  we will receive million in  which was earned in the first quarter of  and another million is no longer considered likely to be received 
there can be no assurance that we will receive any of the remaining million in milestone payments 
in addition  we may receive royalties of to percent on incremental net sales above a baseline amount of our then four marketed specialty pharmaceutical products through revenues from these milestones and or royalties is reflected as part of our continuing operations 
prior year results of operations of the specialty pharmaceutical business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for comparability 
income taxes federal legislation  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which allowed us to make an election to treat certain unused research and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as refundable in lieu of claiming bonus and accelerated depreciation for eligible qualified property placed in service through the end of was extended to this provided us with a million benefit in the balance of the income tax benefit reflects a reduction of million to state taxes payable 
in november  federal legislation was enacted under which we are able to carryback our alternative minimum tax net operating losses to the five previous years to offset the alternative minimum taxes that were not available to us for carryback prior to the new legislation 
we recorded the impact of the carryback  estimated to be approximately million  in the fourth quarter of and received a federal income tax cash refund in the first quarter of other legislation in allowed us to make an election to treat certain unused research and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as refundable in lieu of claiming bonus and accelerated depreciation for eligible qualified property placed in service through the end of this provided us with a million benefit in offsetting these two tax benefit amounts which total million was a million charge related to an adjustment of state taxes payable 
income tax expense in was primarily comprised of certain state taxes 
no federal income tax expense was incurred in relation to normal operating results due either to current period operating losses or the utilization of deferred tax assets to offset taxes that would otherwise accrue to operating income 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business in january partially offsetting the sale proceeds  approximately million in cash was utilized to repurchase common stock 
approximately million of cash was received as a result of employee exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity 
cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations during was million whereas in there was a use of operating cash by continuing operations of million 
the primary contributor to the approximately million difference was the change in loss from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations in was million compared to a loss of million in the results of operations of our continuing operations included the receipt of million related to the sale of in process research and development 
as there was no book basis in this asset  the entire proceeds represented positive cash inflow largely offsetting the cash outflows resulting from the regular operations of our continuing business during the year 
when adjusted for noncash and nonoperating items  the loss from continuing operations in of million was converted into a positive cash flow of approximately million 
such noncash items in had less of a positive cash flow effect by approximately million 
fluctuations in operating asset and liability balances in constituted a source of cash of million 
in  fluctuations in operating asset and liability accounts resulted in a use of cash of approximately million 
cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in was down from that of by approximately million primarily due to million greater loss from operations of the continuing business and less cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities amounted to million in cash proceeds from the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business amounted to million  excluding the million attributed to the sale of in process research and development and included in income from continuing operations 
net sales and maturities of marketable securities generated million of cash while investments in property and equipment utilized million of cash in in  net investments in marketable securities of million plus purchases of property and equipment of million resulted in a use of cash in investing activities of continuing operations of million 
net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in was comprised of investments in property and equipment plus a million milestone payment related to sales of the divested product  oncaspar 
financing activities in  and related primarily to repurchases of our outstanding shares and the repurchase and refinancing of our long term debt  offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options 
exclusive of transaction costs  we expended approximately million during and million during december to repurchase shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the majority of the purchases were made pursuant to a million share repurchase plan announced december  a million share repurchase program was announced in the latter half of december and remains in effect as of december  through february   approximately million additional shares have been purchased under the repurchase program at a cost of approximately million 
the repurchase of a portion of outstanding notes payable constituted a use of cash of million in and million in no notes were repurchased during although there was a noncash conversion that took place during the first quarter of see below 
during  approximately million of cash was received as the result of employee exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity 
as of december   the principal amount of the notes payable outstanding was million 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business constituted a fundamental change under the indenture for the notes  which triggered a requirement that we offer to purchase all of the notes at face value 
on february   we initiated a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the notes at face value 
the offer expired on march  with no notes having been tendered 
the fundamental change also triggered a change in the conversion rate from shares per  principal amount of notes to shares per  principal amount of notes during the period january  to march  during this period  million principal amount of the notes were converted into approximately million shares of our common stock  reducing the principal balance of the notes outstanding to million 
subsequent to the march   the date the enhanced conversion period ended  the original conversion rate of shares per  principal amount is again in effect 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves and royalties primarily those related to sales of pegintron 
in january  we received a million milestone payment in connection with the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
per the terms of the sale agreement  we were entitled to the million payment upon regulatory approval of an sbla regarding a new api starting material for the manufacture of ss oncaspar 
this approval was received in january no further milestones related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business are expected in and there can be no assurance that any of these milestones will be received in the future 
based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs  our current sources of liquidity  the expected cash outflows from operations and the purchase of up to million of our outstanding stock  we anticipate our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
while we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operational needs for the near future  it is likely that we will need to obtain additional financing or enter into a collaborative arrangement to sustain our research and development efforts prior to the time we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds or engage a collaborator on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or collaborative support  we may be required to curtail our research and development activities and or license our product candidates to third parties 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet special purpose entity transactions 
our notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at december   the potential dilutive effect of conversion of the notes was million shares using the conversion price of per share or shares per  principal amount of notes 
in addition  stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and million restricted stock units were outstanding at december   that represent additional potential dilution 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years notes payable due june  operating lease obligations interest due on notes payable totals does not include potential milestone payments of million to santaris that are only payable upon successful development of all eight mrna targets selected by us 
does not include separation payments of approximately million to be made to exiting employees in connection with the restructurings 
does not include lease revenues to be received pursuant to certain subleased facilities 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the notes rank equal to all future senior unsecured debt 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the date one day prior to the date of a notice of redemption is greater than percent of the applicable conversion price on the date of such notice  we  at our option  may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
we lease three facilities in new jersey 
future minimum lease payments and commitments for operating leases total million at december  in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease of a portion of the office space located in bridgewater  new jersey 
we anticipate that the remainder of the space in bridgewater will be vacated by march  as we consolidate our administrative and research organizations in our piscataway location 
we are actively seeking a tenant or tenants for the excess bridgewater capacity 
in october  we entered into a sublease of the south plainfield facility under which we will receive rental income in excess of the rental expense being incurred under the original lease 
our use of the leased south plainfield facility not included in the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business has ended  but we continue to be primarily responsible for the obligations attendant to the continuing operating lease of the facility including returning the facility to its original condition upon expiration  if necessary 
we may experience additional charges associated with the lease or its termination prior to the contractual expiration of the lease in october in july  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with santaris pursuant to which we obtained exclusive rights worldwide  other than in europe  to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against the hif a  survivin and ar gene targets  as well as rna antagonists directed against five additional gene targets selected by us 
we will be responsible for making additional payments upon the successful completion of certain compound synthesis and selection  clinical development and regulatory milestones 
santaris also is eligible to receive royalties from any future product sales of products based on the licensed antagonists 
santaris retains the right to develop and commercialize products developed under the collaboration in europe 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues royalties under our license agreements with third parties and pursuant to the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the third party and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information generally is received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
contingent payments due under the asset purchase agreement related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized as income when the milestone has been achieved and collection is assured 
such payments are non refundable and no further effort is required on the part of the company or the other party to complete the earning process 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business involved the application of guidance regarding multiple deliverables in separating the revenues associated with the sale of in process research and development from the other elements of the transaction  namely the assets sold as part of discontinued operations and our continuing involvement in contract research activities 
we determined that the in process research and development had value to the buyer of the specialty pharmaceutical business on a stand alone basis and that there was objective and reliable evidence available to support the allocation of the total purchase price to the respective units of accounting 
research and development expenses we accrue expenses for costs for work performed by contract research organizations  contract manufacturing organizations and others based upon the estimated amount of the total effort completed on each order  study or project using factors such as number of lots produced  number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we base the estimates on the information available at the time 
additional information may come available at a later date that would enable us to develop a more accurate estimate 
such changes in estimate are generally recognized in the period when the information is first known 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we believe  based on projections  that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
share based payments compensation cost  measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned 
the impact that share based payment awards will have on our results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price and fair value of our stock at date of grant or modification 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of our stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on our historical stock price information
