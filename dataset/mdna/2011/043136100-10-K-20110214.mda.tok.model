item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe these policies are critical because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the end of a period and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
due to the complexity of these critical accounting policies  our accounting methods relating to these policies involve substantial use of estimates 
estimates are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions  including assumptions about future events 
our estimates may not include assumptions that reflect very positive or very negative market conditions and  accordingly  our actual results could differ significantly from those generated by our estimates 
as a result  the estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements  as well as our estimates of our future results of operations  may be significantly inaccurate 
we may be the subject of federal  state and or foreign government civil and criminal enforcement efforts against health care companies  which could result in civil and or criminal penalties which could have a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition 
in addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies  both federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts against health care companies  as well as their executives and managers 
these efforts generally relate to a wide variety of matters  including referral and billing practices  and implicate a variety of state and federal laws  including state insurance fraud provisions  common law fraud theories  as well as both state and federal fraud and abuse  anti kickback  false claims statutes  and the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international anti bribery laws and regulations 
although we no longer directly bill any payor  some of our prior activities could become the subject of additional governmental investigations or inquiries 
in addition  even though we no longer directly bill any payor  we are still subject to health care fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 
moreover  recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws 
for example  the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which was signed into law in march  among other things  amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes  a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes 
moreover  we expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and or regulations  proposed and implemented  that could impact our operations and business 
the extent to which future legislation or regulations if any relating to health care fraud abuse laws and or enforcement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain 
if our operations 
table of contents are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from governmental health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations  any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
we may in the future be subject to intellectual property claims  which are costly to defend  could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to additional patent infringement claims or other litigation  including interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits  uspto reexamination and interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings  generally are costly and time consuming 
if other parties violate our proprietary rights  further litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  to protect trade secrets or know how we own or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or reexamination or interference proceedings will be costly and cause significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in existing claims  additional litigation or reexamination or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using certain technology 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we could obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future growth prospects 
our intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products  business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our coblation technology and our acquired technologies 
we believe that our issued patents are directed at the core technology used in our soft tissue surgery systems  including both multi electrode and single electrode configurations of our disposable devices  as well as the use of coblation technology in specific surgical procedures 
in addition  we believe that our issued patents are directed at many of the core features of our acquired technologies from opus  parallax  atlantech and applied therapeutics  inc ati 
our earliest coblation related patents will begin to expire in the majority of our royalty income is associated with licenses that include core coblation patent rights which extend through the end of there is no assurance that the patents we have obtained  or any patents we may obtain as a result of our pending us or international patent applications  will provide any competitive advantages for our products 
we also cannot assure investors that those patents will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented prior to their expiration 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  have not already applied for or obtained  or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our products either in the us or in international markets 
in sports medicine  many of our competitors have licensed our technology for limited fields of use 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a 
table of contents period after filing 
we may not be aware of all of the patents and patent applications potentially adverse to our interests 
a number of medical device and other companies  universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have issued patents relating to monopolar and or bipolar electrosurgical methods and apparatus 
we have received  and we may receive in the future  notifications of potential conflicts of existing patents  pending patent applications and challenges to the validity of existing patents 
in addition  we have become aware of  and may become aware of in the future  patent applications and issued patents that relate to our products and or the surgical applications and issued patents and  in some cases  have obtained internal and or external opinions of counsel regarding the relevance of certain issued patents to our products 
we do not believe that our products currently infringe any valid and enforceable claims of the issued patents that we have reviewed 
however  if third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by our technology and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may not be able to obtain licenses to those patents at a reasonable cost  if at all  or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 
our inability to do either would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
we cannot assure investors that we will not have to defend ourselves in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents  or that such defense would be successful 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
we require our key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information  developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual relationship with us  is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property 
we cannot assure investors that employees will not breach such agreements  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological change or successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance  which could cause us to lose business to competitors 
we compete in a market characterized by rapidly changing technology 
we may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products 
our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products in a cost effective manner  to introduce these products to the market on a timely basis  and to achieve market acceptance of these products 
factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include capital constraints  research and development delays  and delays in acquiring regulatory approvals 
our new products and new product introductions may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance 
factors impacting the level of market acceptance include our ability to successfully implement new technologies  the timeliness of our product introductions  our product pricing strategies  our available financial and technological resources for product promotion and development  our ability to show clinical benefit from our products  and the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products as discussed in the risk factor titled changes in coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products could affect physicians below 

table of contents the markets for our products are intensely competitive  which may result in our competitors developing technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that make our technologies and products obsolete 
many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and market power than we do 
the markets for our current products in our core businesses are intensely competitive 
we cannot assure you that other companies will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than ours  or that would render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive in these markets 
our primary competitors across all of our operating units consist of medtronic  inc  smith nephew  stryker corporation  johnson johnson  olympus through their subsidiary gyrus  and arthrex  inc 
these competitors tend to be large  well financed companies with diverse product lines who may have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and technical resources than we do 
some of these companies offer broad product lines that they may offer as a single package and frequently offer significant price discounts as a competitive tactic 
furthermore  some of our competitors utilize purchasing contracts that link discounts on the purchase of one product to purchases of other products in their broad product lines 
many of the hospitals in the us have purchasing contracts with our competitors 
accordingly  customers may be dissuaded from purchasing our products instead of our competitors products to the extent the purchase would cause them to lose discounts on our competitors products 
in addition  we are aware of several small companies offering alternative treatments for back pain and other ailments or indications that may indirectly compete with our products 
if we were to be unable to continue to compete for any of the above reasons  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
until we resolve our contingencies  we may not have access to a cost effective credit facility and we will be required to fund a significant amount of cash to fund our working capital needs and planned expenditure with cash on hands 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
in the absence of a credit facility as a possible source of liquidity  our ability to meet our working capital needs and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations and effectively manage our cash balances 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control 
we are unable to predict the outcome of ongoing litigation and investigations to which we are a party and these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows 
see note  litigation and contingencies  in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on legal proceedings 
we expect that our cash flows from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our short term and  excluding the uncertainty related to the ongoing litigation and investigations to which we are a party  long term normal operating liquidity requirements  however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  from time to time  we may be required to seek financing from alternative sources 
we cannot assure you that such alternative funding will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  we maintain deposit accounts with numerous financial institutions around the world in amounts that exceed applicable governmental deposit insurance levels 
while we actively monitor our deposit relationships  the unanticipated failure of a financial institution in which we maintain deposits could cause us to suffer losses that could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents any control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations  investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities 
internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations 
internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures 
internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override 
because of such limitations  there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting 
a failure to remain current in our filings may have material impacts on our business and liquidity 
if we are not able to remain current in our filings with the sec  we will face several adverse consequences and restrictions 
we will not be able to have a registration statement under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  covering a public offering of securities  declared effective by the sec  or make offerings pursuant to existing registration statements  we will not be able to make an offering to any purchasers not qualifying as accredited investors under certain private placement rules of the sec under regulation d  we will not be eligible to use a short form registration statement on form s for a period of at least months after the time we become current in our periodic and current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  we will not be able to deliver the requisite annual report and proxy statement to our stockholders to hold our annual stockholders meeting  our employees cannot be granted stock options  nor will they be able to exercise stock options registered on form s  because form s would not be available to us  and our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
these restrictions may impair our ability to raise funds in the public markets  should we desire to do so  and to attract and retain employees 
in addition  pursuant to the registration rights agreement between us and the holders of our series a preferred stock  if our registration statement ceases to be available to the holders of our series a preferred stock  a registration default occurs 
if we are not able to cure this registration default in a timely manner we are obligated to pay the holders of the series a preferred stock percent per annum of the original liquidation preference of the series a preferred stock  accruing from the date of the registration default until the registration default is cured 
medical device reprocessors that reprocess our single use devices and then provide them to customers at a lower cost than a new device may adversely affect our business 
certain medical device reprocessors routinely collect used or opened but unused single use devices from customers and reprocess and repackage these products to customers at a price lower than the price of a new device 
these reprocessed devices may be confused with our authorized products  reduce our product sales and harm our reputation with key physicians who may not have knowledge that the devices have been reprocessed 
in addition  this may increase time and expense spent investigating and addressing performance issues  including product liability issues  related to reprocessed devices 
we may be required to incur additional expense to protect ourselves against performance claims associated with reprocessed devices and to enforce infringements by reprocessors of our proprietary and contractual rights 

table of contents failure to obtain fda clearance or approval for our products could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  and future growth prospects 
in the us  before we can market a new medical device  or a new use of  or claim for  or significant modification to  an existing product  we must first receive either premarket clearance under section k of the us federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or fdca  or approval of a pma submission from the fda  unless an exemption applies 
in the k clearance process  the fda must determine that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally on the market  known as a predicate device  with respect to intended use  technology and safety and effectiveness  in order to clear the proposed device for marketing 
clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence 
however  as was the case in our recent submission for k clearance of coblator iq ent plasma wands  the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for k clearance is not substantially equivalent  or nse  to a predicate device 
recent trends in fda review of k submissions suggest that fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new  more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated 
this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process 
in january  the fda announced twenty five specific action items it intends to take with respect to the k process to add greater transparency and certainty to the review process 
these reforms  when fully implemented  could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances  increase the costs of compliance  or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances 
an fda nse determination means that the device is automatically reclassified into class iii and we cannot market the device unless it is either approved through the pma process or reclassified into class i or class ii based on further submissions with supporting data 
a new submission may require clinical data 
the pma approval pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based  in part  on data obtained in clinical trials 
both of these processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees  unless exempt 
the fda k clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain than the k clearance process 
it generally takes from one to three years  or even longer  from the time the pma application is submitted to the fda until an approval is obtained 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain fda clearance or approval for any of our new products on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval for our new products could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  and future growth prospects 
modifications to our currently fda cleared products may require new regulatory clearance or approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing our current products until clearances or approvals are obtained 
after a device receives k premarket notification clearance from the fda  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device  technology  materials  packaging  and certain manufacturing processes may require a new k clearance or premarket approval  or pma 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new k clearance or pma approval in the first instance  but the fda may review any manufacturer decision and may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting k clearance or an application for pma approval 
the fda also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or approval is obtained 
fda guidance documents define when to submit premarket notifications for new or modified devices 
these guidance documents also define modifications for which a new k is not required 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  and have determined that in certain instances new k clearances or pma 
table of contents approvals are not required 
no assurance can be made that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance or pma approval 
if the fda requires us to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance or pma approval  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we may be subject to fines  penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off label uses  which would adversely affect our financial condition 
our promotional materials and training methods must comply with fda regulations and other applicable laws and regulations  including the prohibition of the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the fda 
use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as off label use 
physicians may use our products off label  as the fda does not restrict or regulate a physician choice of treatment within the practice of medicine 
however  if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes the promotion of an off label use  it could subject us to certain sanctions ranging from a request that we modify our training or promotional materials to further regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and or criminal penalties against us or our officers or employees 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
in that event  our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired 
although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off label promotion of our products  the fda or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off label promotion 
in addition  the off label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients  and  in turn  the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management attention and result in substantial damage awards against us 
our products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation  business operations and financial results  and if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury  we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations  which can result in voluntary corrective actions or fda enforcement actions 
the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health 
manufacturers may  under their own initiative  recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health  component failures  manufacturing errors  design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues 
recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any of these sanctions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers demands 
we may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits 
further  under the fda medical device reporting regulations  or mdr  we are required to report to the fda any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury 
any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions  such as recalls or customer notifications  or agency action  such as inspection  mandatory recall or other enforcement action 
any corrective action  whether voluntary or 
table of contents involuntary  as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit  will require the dedication of our time and capital  distract management from operating our business  and may harm our reputation and financial results 
if we or our third party suppliers fail to comply with the fda quality system regulations  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted and our sales and our ability to generate profits could suffer 
we and certain of our third party suppliers are required to comply with the fda quality system regulation  or qsr  which covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  sterilization  storage and shipping of our products 
we and our suppliers are also subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process if we market our products in these jurisdictions 
the fda enforces the qsr through periodic and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities 
if our facilities or those of our suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection  the fda could take enforcement action  including any of the following sanctions untitled letters  warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  customer notifications or repair  replacement  refunds  recall  detention or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing or delaying our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products  withdrawing k clearances on pma approvals that have already been granted  refusal to grant export approval for our products  or criminal prosecution 
any of these sanctions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers demands 
we may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits 
we require foreign regulatory approvals to market and sell our products in other countries 
failure to obtain and maintain these regulatory approvals could harm our ability to generate revenue 
to be able to market and sell our products in other countries  we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals and the time required for regulatory review  vary from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is expensive  and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products 
if we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  our ability to generate revenue could be harmed 
changes in coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products could affect use of our devices and our future revenue 
the demand for our products is highly dependent on the policies of third party payors such as medicare  medicaid  private insurance  and managed care organizations that reimburse our customers when they use our products 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our products are used  or adverse changes in environmental and private third party payors policies toward coverage and reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 

table of contents in the us  third party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements 
we are aware of several third party payors in the us  including governmental payors such as medicare and medicaid and private health insurance companies  who consider coblation technology used in certain procedures to treat certain clinical conditions to be experimental or investigational 
these payors have developed policies that deny coverage and therefore make no reimbursement for such procedures using our devices 
procedures using our devices that are not covered by some payors include such procedures as plasma disc decompression  or coblation nucleoplasty  as well as coblation or radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction for removing soft tissue during arthroscopic surgery  hypertrophied nasal turbinates for the treatment of chronic nasal obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea and soft palate and tongue for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 
however  some payors in the us provide coverage and reimbursement for coblation tonsillectomy for certain clinical indications and percutaneous vertebroplasty for patients that meet specified criteria 
in addition  some payors are moving toward a managed care system and control their health care costs by limiting authorizations for surgical procedures  including elective procedures using our devices 
failure to obtain favorable payor policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
in addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies  third party payors from time to time update reimbursement amounts and also revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts 
this includes annual updates to payments to ambulatory surgical centers and physicians for procedures using our products 
since reimbursement for our products generally is included as part of the payments for procedures  these updates directly impact the amounts recognized for the costs of our products 
an example of payment updates is the medicare program updates to physician payments  which is done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula 
in the past  when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment  congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions 
for  cms projected a rate reduction of under the statutory formula and a number of legislative measures were passed to prevent this reduction 
for the second half of  the update factor was increased by percent 
for  the medicare and medicaid extenders act of which was signed into law on december   froze the update through because cms was required to make its other changes to the medicare physician fee schedule including adjustments made to certain codes identified to be misvalued budget neutral  cms made a downward adjustment to what is known as the conversion factor  which translates values into dollar amounts 
whereas the conversion factor for the end of was  it is for at this time  is it uncertain how the change would affect our business 
if congress fails to intervene to prevent the negative update factor in the future  the resulting decrease in payment may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
new laws  regulations and judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations and decisions that relate to healthcare availability  methods of delivery or payment for products and services  or sales  marketing or pricing may cause our revenue to decline 
in addition  we may need to revise our research and development plans if a program or programs no longer are commercially viable 
such changes could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility 
the ppaca legislation  among other things  imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers which will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry  and could have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 
other elements of this legislation such as comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could significantly change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and may materially impact many aspects of our business 
if we obtain the necessary international regulatory approvals  market acceptance of our products in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of coverage and 
table of contents reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we intend to seek international reimbursement approvals  although we cannot assure investors that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
we are also unable to predict at this time the impact on our business of any future changes  if any  that are made to coverage and reimbursement policies by government action in key international markets 
product liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition and impair our reputation 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
in addition  many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to a patient 
the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of one or more of our products  which could ultimately result in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding associated costs and damages  which could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  our ability to attract and retain customers for our products  and future growth prospects 
we cannot assure you that our current product liability insurance coverage limits are adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur in connection with the development  manufacture and sale of our products 
in addition  we may require increased product liability coverage as products are successfully commercialized in additional applications 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  our ability to attract and retain customers for our products  and future growth prospects 
we are dependent on key suppliers  and supply disruptions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
some of the key components of our products are purchased from single vendors 
if the supply of materials from a single source supplier were interrupted  replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to the regulatory and other requirements applicable to our manufacturing operations or the availability of certain product drawings and or specifications 
a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require us to obtain clearance prior to our marketing a product containing new material 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time and we cannot assure investors that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for a new material to be used in our products on a timely basis  if at all 
this could create supply disruptions that would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
in addition  we primarily use a subcontractor located in costa rica to sterilize our disposable devices 
we have the ability to use alternative sterilization service providers for most of our products 
if our costa rica sterilization service were to be disrupted for any reason  we would be required to use alternative sources with longer processing and logistics cycles  which could lead to a disruption in our ability to supply products for a period of time 
we are dependent on warehouses in the us and belgium owned and operated by deutsche post dhl  inc if our ability to use these warehouses is disrupted  we may be unable to supply products to our customers on a timely basis  which could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents the complex nature of the underlying support technologies utilized to exchange critical product information with third party transportation and logistics providers  such as electronic data interchange  has  at times  caused disruptions in our ability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
failure of these supporting systems could impair our business for the duration of the failure 
our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations 
international operations are generally subject to a number of risks  including protectionist laws  business practices  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers that favor local competition  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  such as tax laws regulating intercompany transactions  difficulties in managing foreign operations  including staffing  seasonality of operations  dependence on local vendors  and collecting accounts receivable  loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and political and economic instability 
we derived percent  percent and percent of our total product sales for the year ended december   and  respectively  from customers located outside of the americas 
we expect international revenue to remain a significant percentage of total revenue and we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities to be successful 
historically  a majority of our international revenues and costs have been denominated in foreign currencies and we expect future international revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to establish appropriate foreign operations  expand international sales channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  develop relationships with international sales representatives  and establish relationships with additional distributors 
in that case  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
even if we are able to successfully expand international operations  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
disruptions or other adverse developments at our costa rica facility could materially adversely affect our business 
our high volume disposable devices and controllers are manufactured at our company owned facility in an industrial park in san jose  costa rica 
if our costa rica facility is not able to produce sufficient quantities of our controllers and products with adequate quality  or if our costa rica operations are disrupted for any reason  then we may be forced to locate alternative manufacturing facilities  including facilities operated by third parties 
disruptions may include  but are not limited to changes in the legal and regulatory environment in costa rica  slowdowns or work stoppages within the costa rican customs authorities  acts of god including but not limited to potential disruptive effects from an active volcano near the facility or earthquakes  hurricanes and other natural disasters  and other issues associated with significant operations that are remote from our headquarters and operations centers 
additionally  continued growth in product sales could outpace the ability of our costa rican operation to supply ordered products on a timely basis or cause us to take actions within our supply and manufacturing operations which increase costs  complexity and timing 
locating alternative facilities would be time consuming  would disrupt our production and cause shipment delays and could result in damage to our reputation and profitability 
additionally  we cannot assure you that alternative manufacturing facilities would offer the same cost structure as our costa rica facility 
future changes in technology or market conditions could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets  including goodwill  resulting in additional non cash charges that could significantly impact our operating results 
our balance sheet includes significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are 
table of contents impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets may be adversely affected by unforeseen and uncontrollable events 
in the highly competitive medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products 
we test our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  but we also test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at any time when there is a change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in substantial non cash impairment charges  which could significantly impact our reported operating results 
delaware law and provisions in our charter could make the acquisition of our company by another company more difficult  which could adversely affect our stock price 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of our company 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  to eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  to specify advance notice and other procedures for director nominations by stockholders and submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings  and to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors 
certain provisions of delaware law applicable to us could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us  including section  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the procedures required for director nominations and stockholder proposals and delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
these provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation  and our bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
one equity partners  a private equity firm  may have influence on our major corporate decisions 
as previously reported  on september   an affiliate of one equity partners  or oep  a private equity firm  acquired our series a preferred stock 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in our form k for a description of this transaction 
as a result of this transaction  oep became the largest beneficial owner of our stock 
at this time  assuming conversion of the series a preferred stock to our common stock  including make whole amounts as defined in the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock but excluding outstanding options and warrants held by other parties  oep would represent an ownership interest of approximately percent of our voting stock 
in connection with this transaction  we expanded the board of directors to eight members and granted oep the right to nominate two directors 
effective september   messrs 
gregory belinfanti and christian ahrens  both partners of oep  were appointed to our board of directors 
consequently  oep may have the ability to influence our board of directors and matters requiring stockholder approval  subject to the restrictions placed on oep by the securities purchase agreement  including without limitation oep agreement to vote for any director nominated by the board and to comply with the terms of the standstill 

table of contents since september   oep is free to convert the series a preferred stock into our common stock and  subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws  dispose of such stock  which could result in a decrease of the market price of our common stock  particularly if such dispositions are made in the open market and are substantial 
we are dependent upon key management  technical personnel and advisors  and loss of our key personnel and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or consultants could have a material adverse effect on us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  any of whom often receive competing employment offers 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
loss of key personnel would materially impact our ability to meet our financial and operational objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations 
circumstances associated with our integration of acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results 
an element of our growth strategy in the future may be the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses that expand or complement our existing products and distribution channels 
integrating businesses  however  involves a number of special risks  including the possibility that management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen costs  difficulties and liabilities in integrating our and the acquired company employees  operations and systems  accounting  regulatory  or compliance issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  challenges in retaining our customers or the customers of the acquired company following the acquisition  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  and impairment charges if our acquisitions are not successful due to these risks 
in addition  we may finance future acquisitions by issuing equity securities  which may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders 
if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate 
in our experience  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
adverse fluctuations due to these factors may adversely affect our level of revenues and profitability  results of operations  financial condition  and future growth prospects in the short and long term the introduction of new product lines and increased penetration in existing applications  achievement of research and development milestones  the amount and timing of expenditures and the receipt and recognition of license fees  and timing of the receipt of orders and product shipments  absence of a backlog of orders  and the rate of product returns 
factors may make the market price of our stock highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future 
investors may be unable to resell our common stock at or above their purchase price 
this volatility may subject our stock price to material fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section  and other factors including market reaction to acquisitions and trends in sales  marketing  and research and development  rumors or dissemination of false information  changes in coverage or earnings estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts or market expectations  and sales of common stock by existing stockholders 

table of contents as previously reported  as of september   oep owns all of our outstanding series a preferred stock 
since september   oep may convert the series a preferred stock into our common stock and  subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws  dispose of such stock  which could result in a decrease of the market price of our common stock  particularly if such dispositions are made in the open market and are substantial

overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets surgical products  many of which are based on our minimally invasive patented coblation technology 
our products are used across several medical specialties  improving many existing soft tissue surgical procedures and enabling new minimally invasive surgical procedures 
our business is divided into two core product areas sports medicine and ent 
we also manufacture and sell products based on our technology for other procedures  such as certain spine procedures 
each of the sports medicine  ent and other product areas market and sell their products in two principal geographic markets americas north and south america and international all other geographies 
as previously reported  in and  we experienced substantial delays in filing our periodic reports as a result of issues identified during the review  which was completed in august  and the restatement of prior financial statements  which was completed in november with the filing of our delinquent periodic reports 
during the year ended december   our results of operations  financial position and cash flows were adversely affected by the effect that the review and the restatement had on our management and employees and the significant costs of the review and restatement 
first quarter accounting corrections our results for the year ended december  include reductions of stock compensation expense to correct forfeiture calculation errors in prior periods 
the impact of the error was an overstatement of operating expenses of million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  to correct this error  we recorded reductions of million to general and administrative expense and million to sales and marketing expense in the quarter ended march  we have determined that the impact of this uncorrected error is immaterial to all prior periods and the year ended december  key financial items  trends and uncertainties affecting our business our management reviews and analyzes several metrics and ratios in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our operating performance 
the most important of these financial metrics and ratios include product sales growth our principal source of revenue is from sales of our products  which primarily include disposable surgical devices and implants 
product sales growth in   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we also contract manufacture disposable surgical devices for use in sports medicine procedures for another medical devices company which is included in product sales 
during the year ended december   product sales from contract manufacturing was 
table of contents million compared to million in contract manufactured products sold in may not be indicative of contract manufactured products in the future 
product sales growth in   and related to our proprietary products which are sold through our direct sales employees  independent sales agents and independent distributors was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we anticipate that our proprietary disposable device sales and implants will remain the key component of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
we also generate revenue from royalties and fees from licensing of our products and technology to other companies and earn other revenues from shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
gross product margin gross product margin as a percentage of product sales in   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
cost of product sales consists of all product manufacturing costs including material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs  adjustments to the carrying value of inventory for excess or obsolete items  certain stock based compensation costs associated with manufacturing and operations personnel and costs of product shipped to our customers 
cost of product sales also includes the amortization of controller units that have been placed at customer locations to enable the use of our disposable surgical products 
we maintain ownership of all placed controllers and the cost of controller units are capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the estimated useful life of the controller unit 
most of our manufactured products are produced at our costa rica facility which has experienced stable operations 
raw materials used to produce our products are generally not subject to substantial commodity price volatility 
the comparability of gross product margin between periods will be impacted by several items  including the mix between proprietary and contract manufactured product sales  the stability of our average sales price on proprietary products  changes in the estimated amount of research and engineering activities related to manufacturing process design or improvement  and  changes in our product emphasis which could result in obsolescence charges being included in the cost of product sales in a particular period 
operating margin operating margin is our income loss from operations as a percentage of total revenues 
our key operating expenses include expenses incurred in connection with research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and amortization of intangible assets 
during and our operating expenses were significantly impacted by the substantial expense incurred in connection with the review and the restatement of our financial statements and goodwill impairment 
operating margin in   and was positive percent  percent  and negative percent  respectively 
we expect to continue to spend approximately to million each quarter in in research  engineering  new product development  regulatory affairs  and clinical studies 
we anticipate that sales and marketing spending could temporarily increase as a percentage of total revenue if we undertake initiatives to expand our direct sales and distribution capabilities 
over the long term  we expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue to remain approximately the same as our current experience 
net earnings net earnings represent the net income or loss in the period 
net earnings will be affected by the same trends that impact our revenues  gross product margin and operating margin 
in addition  net earnings will also be affected by other income and expenses  such as interest expense  foreign currency 
table of contents gains and losses and income taxes 
interest expense and bank fees were lower in the year ended december  as we repaid all outstanding bank borrowings on september  and we anticipate this trend to continue until we enter into credit facilities in the future 
we expect that we will report foreign currency gains or losses each period due primarily to changes in the value of the euro  british pound and australian dollar versus the us dollar 
our effective income tax rate is less than the us statutory rate as many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have lower corporate statutory tax rates  including costa rica  where we have a tax holiday that extends through december in years of loss  our effective tax rate may exceed the us statutory rate depending on the apportionment of income or loss between jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expect to be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  our liquidity needs have been to finance the costs of operations  to acquire complementary businesses or assets and to make repurchases of our common stock 
our operating cash flow has historically been affected by the overall profitability of the sales of our products  our ability to invoice and collect from customers in a timely manner  and our ability to efficiently implement our acquisition strategy and manage costs

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires our management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of revenue  expenses  income  assets and liabilities  reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment  assumptions and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we describe our most significant accounting policies in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations 
these policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments  estimates and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from sales of our products through our direct sales professionals  independent sales agents and independent distributors 
we recognize these revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement providing for the sale of a product  delivery of the product has occurred  the sale price of the product is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for product sales made by our direct sales professionals or independent agents  our criteria for revenue recognition is complete when our product is delivered to end customers  such as surgical centers and hospitals 
these sales occur either through a purchase order submitted by the customer or through trunk sales 
for purchase orders  we ship product to and invoice the end customer directly 
for trunk sales  product is hand delivered at the end customer premises from trunk stock maintained by the direct sales representative or independent agent and a bill only order is received notifying us of the product delivery at which time we invoice the end customer 
sales to distributors occur either as stocking and replenishment orders or as drop shipments to end customers 
in the majority of cases involving sales to distributors  our requirements for revenue recognition are met when we deliver product to a particular distributor 
in the case of certain distributors  prior to march  we had agreed to pricing reductions based on the distributors ultimate reselling price and in those cases we recognized revenue on a sell through basis only after the distributor had sold our products to an end user 
in order to determine the amount of sell through revenue that should be recognized during a given reporting period  we relied on reports from the distributors that provided us with information about sales to end customers during the reporting period as well as the amount and types of our products in the distributor inventory at the end of a reporting period 
our management was required to exercise a significant level of judgment to determine the accuracy and reliability of the reported information 
we used a first in first out accounting method to account for products sold by these distributors where we applied the sell through method 
our customers generally have the right to return or exchange products purchased from us for up to days from the date of product shipment 
at each period end  we determine the extent to which our revenues need to be reduced to account for returns and exchanges and we record a reserve against revenue recognized during that period for product returns and exchanges that our management estimates are likely to occur after the end of that period 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with our customers and on direct customer feedback 
we had an agreement with one customer that provided for an extended right of exchange 
our management concluded that the duration of the exchange agreement with this customer was inconsistent with our revenue recognition criteria and as a result revenue related to product sales to this customer was deferred until the related right of exchange period expired during the first quarter of this customer no longer has this extended right of return 
our revenue recognition is also impacted by management estimate of our customers ability to pay us pursuant to the terms of our customer agreements 
if after we have recognized revenue  collectability of an account receivable becomes doubtful  we will establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to the previously recognized revenue that remains uncollected 
where our 
table of contents management forms a judgment that a particular customer has not established a sufficient credit history but decides to deliver products to the customer  we will defer recognizing revenues on product sales to that customer until collectability is reasonably assured  which typically coincides with the collection of cash 
once the customer establishes a reliable payment history we generally return to normal revenue recognition based on our criteria 
we regularly review the creditworthiness of our customers considering such factors as historical collection experience  a customer current credit standing  the age of accounts receivable balances  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer ability to pay both individually and in the aggregate 
prior to ceasing activities in our discocare and drs subsidiaries in early  products were billed to and cash collected from third party payors for which we have determined that we are unable to conclude as to whether the exchange represented persuasive evidence of an arrangement providing for the sale of product or whether amounts billed  including those collected  would be subject to future disputes with the payor due to insurance reimbursement practices 
accordingly  product sales revenues have been reversed until the company is able to conclude on the above  including revenue for product sales where the company has collected cash 
cash received from third party payors related to discocare and drs has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability pending the resolution of any possible dispute 
with the cessation of the discocare and drs businesses  we are no longer engaged in product sales activities where we bill third party payors 
although the terms of our agreements with many of our customers provide that risk of loss passes to the customer upon shipment  we have historically accepted the risk of loss until product delivery 
accordingly  we only recognize revenues on a product sale if  in management judgment  it has been delivered during the relevant reporting period 
the application of this policy requires our management to make estimates as to the timing of deliveries 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with product shipments to particular markets that we serve 
we regularly compare these estimates to actual results based on delivery confirmations to determine whether a change of estimate is required 
we generally recognize license fees and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement 
royalties represent the largest component of non product sales revenue and are recognized as earned  based on our estimates using current and historical trends adjusted for market factors  and are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations 
when we make payments to our customers  we recognize those payments as a reduction of revenue unless we can determine that we received products or services that have a fair value equal to the amount of the payment to the customer 
in order to determine the fair value of the products or services received and whether alternative sources of supply exist  management is required to use judgment and make estimates to determine the amount that should be classified as a reduction of revenue and the amount to be classified as an expense 
inventory allowance we value our inventory based on cost 
we adjust the value of our inventory to the extent our management determines that our cost cannot be recovered due to obsolescence or other factors 
in order to make these determinations  our management uses estimates of future demand and sales prices for each product to determine appropriate inventory reserves and to make corresponding reductions in inventory values to reflect the lower of cost or market value 
in the event of a sudden significant decrease in demand for our products  or a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence  we could be required to increase our inventory reserve  which would increase our cost of product sales and decrease our gross profit 

table of contents long lived assets our goodwill balance is not amortized to expense  instead it is tested for impairment at least annually 
during  we changed our annual goodwill impairment test date from december to october  which represents a change in accounting principle 
management concluded that this change was preferable as it facilitates the timely reporting of our financial results if events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses  we perform an impairment analysis of goodwill at that date 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant asset 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we verify there are no changes to our reporting units with goodwill balances  allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  determine the carrying value  or book value  of our reporting units  as some of the assets and liabilities related to each reporting unit are held by a corporate function  estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model  reconcile the fair value of our reporting units in total to our market capitalization adjusted for a subjectively estimated control premium and other identifiable factors  compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  and if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and recognize an impairment charge if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis  including the identification of our reporting units  identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units and determination of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analyses  we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that represent the highest and best use for our reporting units 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in further goodwill impairment charges 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management 
on october   we performed our required annual goodwill impairment test 
our goodwill has been allocated to our sports medicine americas  ent americas and international reporting units 
the test requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  we are required to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill to its implied fair value 
the fair values of our sports medicine americas  ent americas and international reporting units  with goodwill balances of million  million and million  respectively  were determined to be in excess of the carrying values of the reporting units and therefore no impairment charges were recognized related to these reporting units 
the discounted cash flow analyses utilized a discount rate of percent for each of the reporting units 
the average growth rates utilized in our discounted cash flow models for the sports medicine americas  ent americas and international reporting units approximated the average growth rate between and we believe these growth rates are reasonable estimates of future performance 
we noted that a percent reduction in the growth rates or a percent increase in the discount rate for the sports medicine americas  ent americas and international reporting units would not result in an impairment charge 
the enterprise fair values implied by the discounted cash flow analysis were below our total market capitalization  which reflects the conservative nature of our forecasts 
as the fair value of the reporting units was significantly above the carrying value using these conservative estimates  we concluded that the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 

table of contents intangible assets with finite lives and property  plant and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period 
we test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the original estimate of an asset useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset 
in addition to testing goodwill impairment  we tested our million of intangible assets associated with our other products and discontinued operations for impairment 
we determined that the future net cash flows associated with each asset were in excess of the carrying value of each asset and therefore  no impairment charge was recorded 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us and other loss contingencies are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue a charge against income when our management determines that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  we accrue for the authoritative judgments or assertions made against us by government agencies at the time of their rendering regardless of our intent to appeal 
in determining the appropriate accounting for loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted 
estimating the probability that a loss will occur and estimating the amount of a loss or a range of loss involves significant judgment 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when we expect the amount of tax benefit to be realized is less than the carrying value of the deferred tax asset 
we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances may change in the future 
changes in facts and circumstances may include a change in the estimated capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  or a change in our corporate liquidity requirements 
such changes could result in our management determining that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in that event  we would be required to recognize income tax liabilities on the assumption that our foreign undistributed earnings will be distributed to the us accounting for income taxes involves uncertainty and judgment on how to interpret and apply tax laws and regulations within our annual tax filings 
such uncertainties from time to time may result in a tax position that may be challenged and overturned by a tax authority in the future which could result in additional tax liability  interest charges and possibly penalties 
an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the liability for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is recorded as 
table of contents other non current liabilities or offsetting deferred tax asset  as applicable 
interest on unpaid taxes and penalties when incurred are classified as a component of income tax expense 
series a convertible preferred stock our series a preferred stock is classified as mezzanine equity and is shown on our balance sheet net of issuance costs 
the difference between the carrying value of the series a preferred stock and its redemption value is accreted over years using the effective interest method 
as the series a preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder  we immediately amortized the entire amount of the beneficial conversion feature  as determined on the date of issuance  as a dividend 
additional dividends are accrued at the stated rate each period so that the mezzanine equity carrying value will equal its redemption value on the fifth anniversary of the issuance when any remaining unconverted series a preferred stock could be redeemable at the option of the holder 
dividends declared on the series a preferred stock shares  the accretion of issuance costs and amortization of the beneficial conversion feature reduce the amount of net earnings that are available to common stockholders and are presented together as a separate amount on the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share based payment awards made to employees  including employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
the determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model inputs 
these include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based on historical data as well as expectations of future developments over the term of the option 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
management estimate of forfeitures is based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially as a result of voluntary employee actions and involuntary actions which would result in a significant change in our stock based compensation expense amounts in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting pronouncements may have a significant effect on our results of operations  our financial condition  our net worth or our business operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance is effective for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after january  with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year 
we do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our interest income is dependent on changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and various deposit accounts 

table of contents the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our cash and cash equivalents in thousands  except percentages cash and cash equivalents average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents foreign currency risk a significant portion of our international sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that the exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate against the us dollar  we will experience variations in our results of operations and financial condition 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  are denominated primarily in us dollars  however  we also maintain balances in euros  british pounds  swedish kroner  swiss francs  australian dollars and costa rican colones in support of local subsidiary operations 
a percent change in the december  exchange rates for these currencies would have an impact on pre tax income of approximately million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against foreign currency exchange risk and do not anticipate doing so in the future 
our objective to minimize foreign currency gains and losses has been managed by maintaining only enough cash necessary for immediate working capital requirements in accounts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and holding the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in us dollar accounts
