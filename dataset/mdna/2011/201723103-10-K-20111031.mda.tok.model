overview we recycle  manufacture  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 

table of contents our business is organized into the following five segments americas recycling  americas mills  americas fabrication  international mills and international marketing and distribution 
our domestic and international distribution business activities consist only of physical transactions and not market speculation 
americas recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of arkansas  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
americas mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills or in the case of the arizona mill a micro mill  that produce one or more of reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  small beams  fence post sections and other shapes  a copper tube minimill which is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics  and scrap metal processing facilities  including two scrap metal shredders  that directly support the steel minimills 
americas fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel plants that bend  weld  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility 
international mills operations international mills includes our polish cmcz and croatian cmcs mills  as well as our recycling and fabrication operations in europe  and have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of the market and the regulatory environment in which our international mills operate is different from our domestic minimills 
we conduct our international mills operations through two rolling mills that produce primarily reinforcing bar and high quality merchant products  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  a specialty rod finishing mill  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  four steel fabrication plants primarily for reinforcing bar and mesh  and an electric arc furnace based steel pipe manufacturer 

table of contents international marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures domestically and internationally 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except per share data net sales earnings loss from continuing operations per diluted share adjusted ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo income expense effect on net earnings loss attributable to cmc per diluted share excludes divisions classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash impairment charges as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating adjusted ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation  and amortization as well as impairment charges 
adjusted ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use adjusted ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
adjusted ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management and part of a debt compliance test for our revolving credit agreement 
reconciliations from net earnings loss from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda are provided below for the years ended august in millions earnings loss from continuing operations less net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interests interest expense income taxes benefit depreciation  amortization and impairment charges adjusted ebitda from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations adjusted ebitda our adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
impairment charges  when necessary  accelerate the write off of fixed assets that would otherwise have been accomplished by periodic depreciation charges 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings loss determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and income taxes 
during  we reduced our global workforce in an effort to further align the business to remain competitive and responsive to current and projected customer demand and took action to close facilities 
we continue to review our 
table of contents product lines  geographic dispersion  and vertical integration consistent with our strategic plan to determine the best allocation of our resources 
we remain committed to our strategy of vertical integration  upstream in scrap recycling and downstream in fabrication 
we also remain committed to serving our customers and believe these actions will allow us to do so in a more efficient manner in the following events and performances had a significant financial impact during as compared to or are expected to be significant for our future operations during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment and other charges for our cmc sisak mill cmcs in croatia 
additionally  we decided to close five rebar locations  four domestically and one international location  and eight construction services crp locations 
in connection with these actions  we incurred asset impairment charges of million  severance costs of million  inventory charges of million  lease termination costs of million and other closure costs of million 
subsequent to year end  on october   we announced the exit of our steel pipe business at cmcs by way of sale and or closure of the mill 
we will close out the existing order book and expect the operation to wind down over the next several months in fiscal net sales of the americas recycling segment increased over and adjusted operating profit increased million driven by higher sales prices and volumes 
net sales of the americas mills segment increased over and adjusted operating profit increased million from increased demand supported by higher finished goods pricing and better margins 
our americas fabrication segment continues to experience unfavorable market conditions due to weak market demand for fabricated steel 
the increase in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to million of impairment and closure costs relating to the closure of rebar and crp locations 
our international mills segment showed a increase in net sales but a million increase in adjusted operating loss due to approximately million of impairment and other charges incurred at cmcs 
our mill in poland recorded an increase in adjusted operating results of million driven by a strong economy in poland and increased sales of merchant bar product 
our international marketing and distribution segment remained profitable for the second straight year and recorded an adjusted operating profit of million 
we recorded consolidated pre tax lifo expense of million compared to lifo income of million in we had one acquisition in australia with a total purchase price of million which will complement our existing operations in australia 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollar amounts below are calculated before income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit loss is the sum of our profit loss before income taxes and financing costs 

table of contents the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mills international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations adjusted operating profit loss americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mills international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations discontinued operations lifo impact on adjusted operating profit loss lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from operations 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from operations 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve

table of contents americas mills we include our five domestic steel mills  including the scrap locations  which directly support the steel mills  and our copper tube minimill in our americas mills segment 
within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our five domestic steel mills was million for as compared to million for the improvement in adjusted operating profit was driven by margin expansion as selling prices outpaced scrap price increases and higher shipments 
additionally  our mill in arizona was profitable during in its second full year of operations 
we recorded lifo expense of million in as compared to lifo expense of million in our mills ran at utilization during as compared to during rebar accounted for of tonnage shipped  consistent with the prior year

lifo expense was million for compared to million in during the second half of  this segment showed improvement as mill prices to the downstream fabricating units stabilized resulting in a slight increase in margins 
backlogs increased in both prices and tonnage as compared to the composite average fabrication selling price was per ton  up from per ton in post and impact metals were profitable for the year 
the overall market remains weak for fabricated steel with credit availability  state and federal funding capacity and unemployment trends affecting the launch of new projects

on october   we announced the closure of cmcs by way of sale and or closure 
after review of the marketplace and our production capabilities we determined that achieving sustained profitability would take additional time and investment in an operation which is not considered a core business 
we will continue to service 
table of contents existing customer commitments and expect to wind down operations in early fiscal in connection with this decision  we expect to incur severance and other closure costs between million and million in we expect the liquidation of working capital and cash tax savings will minimize the cash flow impact of these restructuring costs 
our fabrication operations in poland and germany had an adjusted operating loss of million during  a decrease in adjusted operating loss of million from during the fourth quarter of  we decided to close our fabrication operation in germany due to challenging market conditions and continued poor operating results 
in connection with the closure  we incurred approximately million in impairment charges relating to the fixed assets of the operation 
these results are included in the overall results of cmcz discussed above 
international marketing and distribution this segment reported an increase in sales of and reported adjusted operating profit of million as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million during this segment recorded lifo expense of million compared to lifo income of million in led by our raw materials marketing operation  each of our major geographic marketing operations was profitable for additionally  our domestic steel import business continued its turnaround with strong performance in overall  our australian operations were profitable but our australian distribution suffered from the weakened state of the economy in australia 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of gam steel pty 
ltd  based in melbourne  australia gam 
gam is a leading distributor and processor of steel long products and plate  servicing the structural fabrication  rural and manufacturing segments in the state of victoria  australia 
the acquisition of gam will complement our existing national long products distribution investments in australia 
corporate our corporate expenses increased million in to million primarily due to higher employee benefit costs  severance costs and information technology costs 
consolidated data the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net loss from continuing operations by approximately million for as compared to increasing our net loss by approximately million for our overall selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million  or  for as compared to sg a expenses increased due to restructuring costs  including severance  higher employee benefit costs and higher information technology costs 
asset impairment charges we recorded impairment charges of million in as compared to million in the impairment charges in primarily relate to impairment charges at cmcs and the closure of certain rebar fabrication and crp locations discussed above 
interest expense our interest expense decreased by million to million during as compared to primarily as a result of the favorable impact of interest rate swap transactions of million  offset by less capitalized interest as a result of completed capital projects during income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended august  was as compared to in our effective tax rate for varies from our statutory rate primarily related to losses in croatia not being tax benefitted as these losses might not be utilized in the allowed carryforward period 
discontinued operations our joist and deck division  classified as a discontinued operation  reported an adjusted operating loss of million during as compared to an adjusted operating loss of million during the results for include carrying costs for the remaining owned real estate assets offset by a gain on the sale of certain joist facilities of million 
the results for includes the impairment and closure costs of exiting the joist and deck business offset by lifo income of million 
outlook although our backlogs remain strong going into fiscal  we believe the recovery in u 
s non residential construction will extend beyond fiscal year with high unemployment  tight credit and a general lack of confidence  private non residential construction will remain challenging in fiscal and any government stimulus programs will have a marginal impact 
we also believe the global macroeconomic environment will remain 
table of contents stagnant 
accordingly  we will continue our efforts to reduce our cost structure  improve operations and enhance cash flows 
we anticipate our americas recycling segment to continue to perform well in a scrap market influenced by global demand 
our americas mills segment should continue its solid performance that benefits from public sector construction and a product mix that includes merchant bar 
americas fabrication will remain challenged with a lack of significant recovery in the non residential construction sector 
forecasted continued growth in the polish and german economies and enhanced product mix will support current levels of volume and pricing at our polish mill 
the global marketing expertise of our international marketing and distribution segment will allow us to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
we anticipate the exiting of our croatian steel pipe business will start to benefit our operations in the second half of fiscal we further believe our restructuring actions have better prepared us to operate effectively in a global market experiencing delayed recovery and have positioned the company to enhance performance when the construction market recovers 
compared to americas recycling during  scrap prices  metal margins and shipments increased as this segment began recovering from the economic recession that significantly impacted operating results in adjusted operating profit for was driven by improved margins from both prices and volumes and cost containment efforts 
metal margins were negatively impacted by lifo expense of million in as compared to lifo income of million in ferrous pricing was stronger as domestic mill operating rates increased and general manufacturing output was higher 
nonferrous pricing was driven by strong export demand  primarily from asia 
we exported of our ferrous scrap tonnage and of our nonferrous scrap tonnage during the year

table of contents in addition to one of our us trading divisions which was winding down operations in and dissolved as of august  liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities 
while we believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially capable  recent events in the global credit markets  including the failure  takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions  have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades 
additionally  changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact our liquidity including the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program and increased cost of borrowing

the availability under the revolving credit agreement is reduced by commercial paper outstanding 
the availability under the revolving credit agreement may be limited by the debt to capitalization ratio covenant 
as of august   there was no amount outstanding under the commercial paper program 
we believe we have access to additional financing and refinancing  if needed 
we utilize uncommitted credit facilities to meet short term working capital needs 
our uncommitted credit facilities primarily support import letters of credit including accounts payable settled under bankers acceptances  foreign exchange transactions and short term advances 
our million notes due november  million notes due july and our million notes due august require only payments of interest until maturity 
our cmcz and cmcs term facilities require quarterly interest and principal payments 
we expect cash from operations to be sufficient to meet all interest and principal payments due within the next twelve months  and we believe we will be able to get additional financing or refinance these notes when they mature 
certain of our financing agreements include various financial covenants 
our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to for the twelve month cumulative period ended august  and for each fiscal quarter on a rolling twelve month cumulative period thereafter 
at august   our interest coverage ratio was to 
the debt to capitalization ratio covenant under the agreement requires us to maintain a ratio not greater than to 
at august   our debt to capitalization ratio was to 
the revolving credit facility is used as an alternative source of liquidity 
our public debt does not contain these covenants 
on october   we repaid our cmcz term note and subsequently entered into uncommitted lines of credit facilities of pln million with several banks 
we regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable 
we actively monitor our accounts receivable and record allowances as soon as we believe accounts are uncollectible based on current market conditions and customers financial condition 
continued pressure on the liquidity of our customers could result in additional 
table of contents reserves as we make our assessments in the future 
we use credit insurance both in the us and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency 
we estimate the amount of credit insured receivables and those covered by export letters of credit was approximately of total receivables at august  for added flexibility  we may sell certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
our domestic sale of receivables program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants that conform to the same requirements contained in our revolving credit agreement 
compliance with these covenants is discussed above 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metal commodity prices 
see note  derivatives and risk management  to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we generated million of net cash flows from operating activities as compared to generating million in significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows inventory more cash was used in as improved demand resulted in increased volume and higher prices in our inventory balance as compared to  other assets more cash was generated during due to income tax refunds received of approximately million primarily consisting of federal tax refunds  and accounts payable accounts payable increased approximately million during to support growth in the business 
however  accounts payable increased more in due to low volumes at the end of from the recession 
during  we used million of net cash flows from investing activities as compared to million in we invested million in property  plant and equipment during  a decrease of million from proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment increased by million as compared to primarily from the sale of certain assets of our joist business and forms from our heavy forms rental business 
additionally  we spent million on acquisitions during we expect our total capital budget for fiscal to be approximately million 
we continually assess our capital spending and reevaluate our requirements based on current and expected results 
during  we used million from financing activities as compared to generating million during the increase in cash used was primarily due to the decrease in documentary letters of credit of million in as compared to the increase in documentary letters of credit of million in our cash dividends have remained consistent at approximately million for both periods 
our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of approximately billion are typically expenditures with normal revenue producing activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and debt facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 

table of contents total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  also  amounts include the effect of our interest rate swaps based on the libor forward rate at august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
another significant obligation relates to capital expenditures 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our insurance providers and suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements  of which million is cash collateralized 
all of the commitments expire within one year 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the potential impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations  our financial position or our cash flows 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all locations where we have operating facilities 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  may expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 

table of contents we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at ten sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we had million accrued for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with cercla sites 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these sites for the years ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined  or into publicly owned treatment works 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters or into publicly owned treatment works  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa s regulations and comparable state regulations may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge or non compliance with permit requirements  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources may be required to construct emission sources using what is referred to as the best available control technology  or in any areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards  using methods that satisfy requirements for lowest achievable emission rate 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require specific sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
during  approximately million of our capital expenditures related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in at the rate of per share for all quarters 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the calculated loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
we account for fabrication projects based on the percentage of completion accounting method 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
these reserves are based on historical trends  current market conditions and customers financial condition 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations  our financial position or our cash flows 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we calculate our lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at period end and recording the resulting lifo income or expense in its entirety 
inventory cost for international and remaining inventories is determined by the first in  first out method  or fifo 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
goodwill we test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value 
our reporting units are based on our internal reporting structure and represent an operating segment or a reporting level below an operating segment 
additionally  our reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
we have determined our reporting units that have a significant amount of goodwill to be our domestic recycling and domestic fabrication segments 
we use a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows including discount rates  volumes  prices  capital expenditures and the impact of current market conditions 
these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions 
we perform the goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred 
based on our analysis during the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted future cash flows from operations 
if an impairment exists  the net book values are reduced to fair values as warranted 
our domestic and international mills  fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations are based upon judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets 
table of contents economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding or utilized during  in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the company or its subsidiaries 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on metal commodity futures exchange quotes  which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margin due to the volatility of the commodity prices on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to minimal gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
natural gas we enter into natural gas forward contracts as economic hedges of the company s americas mills operations based on anticipated consumption of natural gas in order to mitigate the risk of unanticipated increases in operating cost due to the volatility of natural gas prices 
freight we occasionally enter into freight forward contracts when sales commitments to customers include a fixed price freight component in order to minimize the effect of the volatility of ocean freight rates 
interest rates we enter into interest rate swap contracts to maintain a portion of our debt obligations at variable interest rates 
these interest rate swap contracts  under which we have agreed to pay variable rates of interest and receive fixed rates of interest  are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
our interest rate swap contract commitments were million as of august  if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the impact on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be approximately million and the impact on fair value of our long term debt would be approximately million as of august
