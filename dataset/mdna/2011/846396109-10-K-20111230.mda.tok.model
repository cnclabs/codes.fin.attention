item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on price increases for polyurethane foam 
as of october   we had unshipped or open orders of approximately million  which represents seven times our open orders of million at fiscal year end the majority of the increase was due to orders from a consumer customer for seasonal promotional items which were shipped prior to november  we expect to fill all orders open as of october  in the fiscal year 
employees we had full time employees as of october  of these employees  were officers  were management personnel  were administrative and clerical personnel  were sales personnel  and were manufacturing personnel 
except as mentioned below  span america is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and has never experienced an interruption or curtailment of operations due to labor controversy 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the assets of mc healthcare 
the manufacturing employees of this facility currently employees are members of the sheet metal workers international association  local union  whose employment is governed by a collective agreement with the union that was assumed by operation of canadian labor law by our new canadian subsidiary in connection with the asset acquisition 
the current union contract expires on october  and continues year to year thereafter unless either party notifies the other that a revision or discontinuance is desired 
mc healthcare had total employees on the acquisition date 
supervision and regulation the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and regulations issued or proposed thereunder  provide for regulation by the fda of the marketing  manufacture  labeling  packaging and distribution of medical devices  including our products 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of fda or other regulatory requirements 
we are certified as an iso and iso supplier for our pressureguard mattress products from our greenville  south carolina plant 
iso the international organization for standardization is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies dealing with quality system requirements that can be used by a supplier to demonstrate its capability and for the assessment of the capability of a supplier by external parties 
compliance with iso standard is required by health canada for all class ii medical devices sold there 
all of our powered therapeutic support surfaces for the health care market are considered class ii medical devices 
the certification is subject to reassessment at six month intervals 
we have maintained our certification based on the results of iso audits conducted during fiscal year mc healthcare 
the canadian food and drugs act  and the medical devices regulations issued thereunder  provide for regulation by health canada of the manufacture  labeling  packaging  distribution  sale and advertisement of medical devices  including the beds made through span medical products canada inc  span america wholly owned subsidiary  some of which are considered class i medical devices

in addition  manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with device safety and effectiveness requirements as required by the medical devices regulations and health canada 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of health canada or other regulatory requirements 
environmental matters our manufacturing operations in the us and canada are subject to various government regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations 
we do not anticipate that continued compliance will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
item a 
risk factors the loss of a key distributor or customer in the company s medical or custom products segments could cause a rapid and significant sales decline  which would likely result in a material decline in earnings 
many of our medical products are sold through large national distributors in the united states and canada 
we do not maintain long term distribution agreements with most of these distributors 
instead  we supply them based on purchase orders that are issued by the customers on a daily or weekly basis 
these supplier customer relationships can generally be ended by either party with minimal notice 
consequently  if a large customer or distributor decided to discontinue purchasing our products  our sales and earnings could quickly decline 
our largest customers in the medical segment are cardinal health and mckesson medical surgical  which each accounted for of sales in the medical segment in fiscal in addition  all of our consumer foam products are sold through our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company  under a marketing and distribution agreement that expires in december the agreement automatically renews for successive three year terms unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least days prior to the expiration date 
sales to louisville bedding company accounted for of sales for the company in fiscal and of sales in the custom products segment 
for more information on major customers and information on our business segments  see the discussions under item business major customers  item business industry segment data medical distributor and private label manufacturing relationships and item business industry segment data custom products  note major customers and note operations and industry segments in the notes to financial statements 
the current weakness in the us economy and associated problems in the credit markets could cause our sales to decline  which in turn could have a material negative effect on our earnings 
our fastest growing products during the last five years have been our lines of therapeutic support surfaces  which consist of our pressureguard and geo mattress products as well as our private label support surfaces 
sales of these support surfaces represented of our total net sales in fiscal these products are generally considered by us and our customers to be capital purchase items instead of consumable supplies 
we believe that purchases of these capital goods are more easily postponed during business downturns than purchases of consumables 
consequently  sales of our support surfaces and bed frames are likely to be more sensitive to general economic weakness than other medical product lines in our business 
also  tight conditions in credit markets could make it more difficult for our customers to obtain financing for capital expenditures  which could slow sales particularly within our support surface product lines 
therapeutic support surface sales decreased during fiscal compared with fiscal sales of our therapeutic support surfaces may continue to decline if the economy remains weak 
in addition  our industrial products are sold primarily to the automotive  packaging and water sports industries  as well as various other manufacturers 
our industrial business has historically been more affected by general economic trends than other span america product lines 
therefore an economic downturn is likely to have a greater effect on sales of industrial products than on other product lines in our business 
sales of industrial products in fiscal year were less than those of fiscal sales of industrial products could decline if the economy remains weak 
since many of our operating costs are fixed within a normal monthly range of sales and production activity  sales declines could result in proportionally greater declines in earnings performance 
we would attempt to reduce expenses in response to lower sales levels  but we cannot give assurance that we would be able to fully offset the effect of a decline in sales volume 
as a result our business could be materially adversely affected by an economic downturn or continuing weakness of the economy 
current weakness in the us and global economy and associated weakness in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of one or more of our key customers or distributors or on several customers and distributors that  in the aggregate  account for a material portion of our sales 
such an adverse effect on our customers or distributors could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our own business and or financial condition as a result of a loss or material reduction in our sales to such customers or distributors and also  potentially  our inability to collect material accounts receivable which accounts receivable are unsecured owed to us by such customers or distributors if they become unable to pay their debts 
our acquisition of mc healthcare in december introduces several new risks for the company  including those related to business integration  international operations  foreign exchange  goodwill impairment and the use of debt to fund a portion of the acquisition purchase price 
although we have no current plans to make significant changes to the operations of mc healthcare  our efforts to integrate the various operational processes of span america and mc healthcare could result in temporary business disruptions or inefficiencies 
in addition  the change in ownership could precipitate changes in mc healthcare s relationships with key customers or suppliers 
these events could have a negative effect on our earnings performance 
while we believe that the mc healthcare acquisition will prove to be successful and improve our financial performance  we cannot guarantee that the acquisition will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks inherent with any acquisition such as retaining key employees and the risk that unexpected liabilities may arise from the mc healthcare acquisition 
mc healthcare s manufacturing facility is located in beamsville  ontario  canada 
we are leasing the current facility under a five year lease agreement as described elsewhere in this report 
as a result  we will be operating in a foreign country under different laws  regulations and customs  all of which will add potential new risks and costs to the company 
prior to the acquisition  span america had no material foreign exchange risk 
as a result of the acquisition  we will manufacture and sell products in the us and canada 
revenues and costs will be incurred in both us and canadian dollars 
we will therefore be subject to realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation activities related to our operations 
these foreign exchange gains or losses could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we expect the acquisition to result in additional goodwill of approximately cdn million 
this goodwill will be evaluated at least annually for possible impairment 
if the goodwill became impaired and not recoverable  it could result in a material non cash charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
to fund the cash portion of the acquisition purchase price  we borrowed million under an amended and restated revolving line of credit that expires on april  we expect to pay down the line of credit as our cash flow from operations permits 
however  as long as we have a balance outstanding under the line of credit  the company will be subject to additional financial risks generally associated with higher leverage 
our medical business could lose sales volume or could have a lower sales growth rate as a result of government reimbursement changes in the medical market 
a number of our medical products are eligible for reimbursement by medicare 
we receive no direct reimbursements from medicare  but our customers often submit reimbursement requests to medicare 
for example  we sell therapeutic support surfaces to home health care dealers who in turn rent these products to patients 
medicare reimburses the dealers for some or all of the patient s rental cost 
if medicare reimbursement rates are reduced  the demand for our medical products that are covered by medicare could decrease  depending on the size of the rate reduction and could have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
our earnings could be negatively affected by raw material cost increases that we are unable to recover through sales price increases 
the cost of polyurethane foam represented approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal an increase in foam raw material costs that we are not able to pass through to our customers by increasing prices could have a significant negative effect on our profitability 
besides polyurethane foam  our other major raw material categories include mattress covers made of various water proof fabrics  vinyl bags  vinyl air cylinders  electronic components for mattresses and corrugated boxes 
raw materials are our single largest cost category  representing approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal cost increases in these raw materials could have a significant adverse effect on earnings if we are unable to recover the higher costs through sales price increases or operating expense reductions 
changes in applicable laws or increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions  as a result of concern over climate change  may result in increased raw material or other costs  which would negatively affect our profitability 
our sales volume could decline as a result of competition from low cost foreign imports 
during the last several years  we have experienced increased competition in our medical and custom products segments from low cost foreign imports 
in the medical segment  the number of low cost  imported mattress products has increased  but it has not yet had a significant impact on our medical business 
we believe that we have potentially greater exposure to low cost imports in our consumer bedding product lines because those products have more commodity like characteristics than our medical products 
also  our customers  which are generally national retailers  are more likely to change suppliers to buy lower cost products 
therefore  we could lose significant sales volume in our consumer bedding business and some portion of our medical sales volume if we are unable to compete effectively with low cost imports 
certain of our medical products are classified as medical devices and are regulated by the fda 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations  the existence of the regulations creates the risk of a product recall and related expenses as well as the risk of additional expenses required to meet new regulatory requirements 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we own our principal office and manufacturing facility  which is located in greenville  south carolina 
this facility contains approximately  square feet used by the medical and custom products segments and is located on a acre site 
we believe that our current manufacturing and storage space is adequate to support our operations during the next several years  depending on sales growth rates 
we also lease  square feet of warehouse space in salt lake city  utah for use as a distribution center for our medical products segment 
we lease this facility on a month by month basis at a rate of  per month 
we consider the south carolina and utah facilities to be suitable and adequate for their intended purposes 
in connection with our acquisition of mc healthcare on december   we signed a year commitment to lease the  square foot manufacturing and showroom facility in beamsville  ontario  canada from mc healthcare s parent corporation  thompson contract supply company limited  at cdn  per year approximately us  at the exchange rate published in the wall street journal on december  with an option to buy the property or continue the lease for an additional years 
we consider the beamsville  ontario facilities suitable and adequate for the conduct of the business acquired from mc healthcare  which is part of our medical products segment 
item legal proceedings from time to time we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
we believe that as a result of legal defenses and insurance arrangements with parties believed to be financially capable  there currently are no proceedings threatened or pending against us that  if determined adversely  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview span america s operations are divided into two primary business units or segments medical and custom products 
our revenues  profits and cash flows are derived from the development  manufacture and sale of products for these two market segments 
in the medical segment  we manufacture and market a comprehensive selection of pressure management products  including geo matt  pressureguard  geo mattress  span aids and isch dish products 
we also market the risk manager bedside safety mat  which is manufactured to our specifications by a third party supplier 
we license and market  but do not manufacture  selan skin care products 
in the custom products segment  we manufacture consumer mattress pads and pillows for the retail bedding market and various engineered foam products for the industrial market 
our consumer mattress pads and pillows are marketed by our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company 
we sell the industrial product line directly to our customers instead of using distributors 
prior to fiscal year  we had a third business unit engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of iv safety catheters 
we decided to exit the safety catheter business in october revenues and expenses related to the safety catheter business in fiscal year are shown in our financial statements as a discontinued operation 
we had no revenues or expenses directly related to the safety catheter business in fiscal years or results of operations fiscal vs 
summary total sales in fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal medical sales decreased to million due primarily to lower sales of therapeutic support surfaces 
custom products sales for fiscal increased to million due to higher sales of consumer bedding products compared with fiscal year net income for fiscal year declined to million  or per diluted share  because of lower sales volume in the medical segment  a less profitable sales mix within our medical segment and our consumer product lines  increased raw material costs and higher administrative expenses 
sales total sales in our core medical business decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decline was due to lower sales of therapeutic support surfaces  which were down by to million during fiscal  compared with million in fiscal therapeutic support surfaces  or mattresses  are our largest medical product line  making up of our medical segment sales in fiscal and in fiscal we sell these products to long term care facilities  home care dealers and hospitals throughout the united states and canada 
sales of therapeutic support surfaces declined in fiscal as a result of lower sales of our pressureguard apm powered product line primarily due to weak economic conditions earlier in the fiscal year 
we experienced sales growth from pressureguard easy air products  our non powered geo mattress product line and the newly launched pressureguard custom care support surfaces that partially offset the declines from other support surface product lines 
performance in our other medical product lines included a increase in sales of the risk manager bedside safety mat  which we introduced in fiscal sales of our span aids patient positioners increased by during fiscal compared with fiscal selan skin care sales declined as did sales of seating products 
sales of mattress overlays declined during fiscal medical sales accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year and in fiscal year we expect medical sales for fiscal to be higher than those of fiscal our custom products segment consists of bedding products for the consumer market and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment rose during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the sales growth came from an sales increase in our consumer product lines  where sales were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal all of our consumer products are sold through our marketing and distribution partner  louisville bedding company 
we expect consumer sales in fiscal to be higher than in fiscal primarily because of a special sales promotion with a retail customer taking place in the first quarter of fiscal in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales remained level at million in fiscal compared with fiscal as lower sales in the water sports market were mostly offset by higher sales in the automotive market 
we believe that industrial sales in fiscal will be higher than in fiscal gross profit our gross profit decreased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decreases in gross profit and gross margin were caused by the following factors a decline in sales volume and a less profitable sales mix within the medical segment  various raw material price increases during the last two quarters of fiscal and a less profitable sales mix for the total company because of the combination of higher sales in the custom products segment and lower sales in the medical segment 
the custom products segment made up of total net sales in this fiscal year compared with in fiscal we expect our gross profit in fiscal to be higher than in however  our gross margin in fiscal could be lower than due to an expected shift in sales mix toward lower margin consumer products 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased less than  remaining at million and of net sales in both fiscal and fiscal the increase occurred in the medical segment and was primarily the result of higher shipping costs 
we believe that total selling and marketing expenses for fiscal will increase over levels 
total research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by the completion in late fiscal of several new product development projects that involved contract services 
we incur almost all of our research and development expenses in the medical segment for the development of new products  new features of existing products and design improvements 
r d expenses will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  depending on the nature of the development projects being pursued 
we expect total r d expenses in fiscal to be higher than levels 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense increase during fiscal resulted from mostly non recurring professional fees and other fees related to our acquisition of mc healthcare as previously discussed 
these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses in fiscal in addition  we had income of  in fiscal from the cash value of life insurance compared with  in fiscal we expect administrative expenses for fiscal to be higher than those of fiscal operating income in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal declined by to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease occurred because medical sales declined and raw material costs increased compared with last fiscal year 
operating income in the custom products segment decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in spite of higher sales volume in the custom products segment  an increase in raw material costs and a less profitable sales mix among our consumer product lines caused the decline in operating income for the custom products segment 
operating income for the total company declined in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the decline in operating income was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical segment and higher raw material costs 
non operating income investment and other income decreased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by an  gain on the sale of assets in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in we expect non operating income in fiscal to be lower than in fiscal interest expense we incurred no interest expense in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility 
on december  we borrowed  to finance a portion of the purchase price of the assets of mc healthcare  so we expect to incur moderate interest expense in fiscal net income and dividends net income decreased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decline in earnings was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical segment  a less profitable sales mix among our consumer products  a less profitable overall sales mix  higher raw material costs in both the medical and custom products segments and higher administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of million  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of two quarterly dividends of per share and two quarterly dividends of per share 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary total sales in fiscal declined to million compared with million in fiscal because of lower sales volumes in both our medical and custom products segments 
medical sales were down to million due primarily to lower sales of capital equipment medical goods  which we believe were negatively affected by the soft economy and uncertainty related to health care reform 
custom products sales for fiscal decreased to million due to lower sales of consumer bedding products compared with fiscal year net income for fiscal year declined to million  or per diluted share  because of lower sales levels  a less profitable sales mix within our consumer product lines and higher r d expenses in the medical segment 
sales total sales in our core medical business decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decline was due to lower sales of therapeutic support surfaces  which were down by to million during fiscal  compared with million in fiscal therapeutic support surfaces  or mattresses  made up of our medical segment sales in fiscal and in fiscal sales of therapeutic support surfaces declined in fiscal due to reduced demand for capital equipment goods among many of our customers and the previous expiration and subsequent wind down of a private label supply contract with hill rom  which was previously disclosed 
most of the fiscal decrease in support surface sales came from our pressureguard cft non powered products and our pressureguard apm powered products 
performance in our other medical product lines included a increase in sales of the new risk manager bedside safety mat  which we introduced at the beginning of our second fiscal quarter in risk manager sales in fiscal were million compared with  in fiscal sales of our span aids patient positioners and mattress overlays increased by and  respectively  during fiscal compared with fiscal selan skin care sales rose 
sales of seating products remained level during fiscal the growth in sales of positioners  overlays and selan products in fiscal was mainly due to stronger demand from our customers in the acute care portion of the medical market 
medical sales accounted for of total net sales in both fiscal years and sales in the custom products segment decreased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the entire sales decrease occurred in the consumer part of the custom products segment  where sales were down to million compared with million in fiscal the consumer sales decline was caused mainly by the loss of volume from a market test program with a large retailer that increased sales in but was not repeated in and the loss of a retail customer in canada due to a routine change in their sales program 
sales to our largest consumer retail customer declined slightly during fiscal  but the decline was primarily caused by a temporary sales price reduction  which began in june as part of a sales promotion program 
all of our consumer sales are made through our marketing and distribution partner  louisville bedding company 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales increased in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal this growth was broad based and was generated from new and existing customers 
during the last three quarters of fiscal  demand for our industrial products increased  particularly among customers in the automotive and packaging markets 
gross profit our gross profit decreased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease was caused by lower sales volume and a less profitable sales mix within our consumer product lines 
gross margin  however  increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was the result of a more profitable sales mix in the medical segment  an increase in sales volume of industrial products and improved manufacturing efficiencies in the medical segment as a result of the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques during the year 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased  to million and of net sales in fiscal compared with million and of net sales in fiscal the decrease occurred in the medical segment and was primarily the result of lower sales commissions related to the decline in sales of therapeutic support surfaces and lower incentive compensation as a result of the earnings decline during the year 
total research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal we incur almost all of our research and development expenses in the medical segment for the development of new products  new features of existing products and design improvements 
the increase in expense was caused by a greater number of new product development projects in fiscal compared with general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense decrease during fiscal was caused by lower costs for incentive compensation and property casualty insurance premiums 
in addition  we had income of  in fiscal from the cash value of life insurance compared with expense of  in fiscal operating income in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal rose by to million compared with million in fiscal the increase occurred even though medical sales declined and was the result of a more profitable medical sales mix  improved manufacturing efficiencies in the medical segment and lower expenses for commissions and incentive compensation compared with last fiscal year 
operating income in the custom products segment decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decrease in profitability of the custom products segment was caused by lower sales volume and a less profitable sales mix among our consumer product lines 
in addition  our manufacturing costs for consumer products were higher  particularly in the fourth fiscal quarter  due to costs related to the start up of a new consumer product line 
operating income for the total company declined in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the decline in operating income was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical and custom products segments  a less profitable sales mix within our consumer product lines  higher consumer manufacturing costs and an increase in r d costs in the medical segment 
non operating income investment and other income increased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase was caused primarily by higher interest income as a result of higher average levels of short term investments in compared with interest expense we repaid the remaining balance of  on our revolving note in the first quarter of fiscal therefore we incurred no interest expense in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility 
net income and dividends net income decreased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decline in earnings was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical and consumer product lines  a less profitable sales mix among our consumer products and slightly higher r d expenses in the medical segment 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of million  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of four quarterly dividends of per share and one special dividend of per share 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of four quarterly dividends of per share 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash flow from operations of million during fiscal  which represented a decrease compared with cash flow from operations of million in fiscal the decrease in cash flow during was caused mostly by an increase in inventories during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with fiscal this increase was necessary to prepare for a large consumer products order that shipped in november and is not representative of the average level of inventory during the full year 
the main uses of cash provided by operations in fiscal were payment of dividends of million and equipment purchases of working capital increased by million  or  to million during fiscal the increase in working capital was primarily caused by the higher inventory balance discussed above 
in addition  our current ratio increased to at fiscal year end from at fiscal year end accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased  or  to million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of fiscal the days sales outstanding or average collection time  calculated using a month average for trade accounts receivable balances  increased to days in compared with days in the longer collection time was primarily the result of extended payment terms offered to several customers on a temporary basis in response to specific market circumstances 
all of our accounts receivable are unsecured 
inventory  net of reserves  increased by million  or  to million at fiscal year end compared with million at fiscal year end as discussed above 
most of the increase occurred in the category of consumer finished goods and was related to a large order that shipped in november in addition  inventory of key components for our therapeutic support surfaces increased significantly during fiscal because inventory of those components was at an unusually low level at the end of fiscal as a result of a supplier problem 
by the end of fiscal inventory levels of therapeutic support surface components were at near normal levels 
as a result of these inventory increases at year end  inventory turns decreased to times in fiscal compared with times in fiscal we expect total inventory in fiscal to be lower and inventory turns to increase compared with fiscal levels 
our deferred income tax asset decreased by  or  during fiscal to  from  due mostly to the write off for tax purposes of a portion of the secure iv inventory  which was written off for book purposes in a prior fiscal year 
prepaid expenses declined  or  to  at october  from  at the end of fiscal the decrease was the result of reductions in the expected refund of income taxes 
net property and equipment decreased by  or  during fiscal the change resulted from the combination of  in depreciation expense offset by capital expenditures of  we expect capital expenditure levels in fiscal to be higher than those of fiscal other assets decreased by  or  to million during fiscal compared with million at fiscal year end due to a decrease in deposits placed with raw material suppliers 
the decline was partially offset by an increase in the cash value of life insurance 
our accounts payable increased by  or  in fiscal to million due primarily to an increase in raw material purchases in september accrued and sundry liabilities decreased by during the year to million compared with million last year due mainly to lower levels of incentive compensation 
on december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of mc healthcare  a beamsville  ontario  canada based company which manufactures hospital bed frames 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was approximately million and included  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from existing cash reserves and funds available under our revolving credit line 
as of october   we had no borrowings under our existing revolving line of credit 
we believe that we were in compliance with the loan covenants as of october  on december  we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of the assets of mc healthcare 
the maximum principal amount we can borrow at any one time under the loan agreement was temporarily increased to million until march   at which time it will revert to million 
the maturity date was extended to april  the agreement is unsecured and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
the current margin is basis points 
the margin in effect during fiscal  the last time we incurred interest  was basis points 
the interest rate  including the margin  at november   the last date at which interest expense was incurred  was 
interest only payments are required monthly 
there are no unused line fees associated with the revolver until april  at which time there is a basis point annual fee on any unused availability above million payable quarterly 
we have pledged to grant the bank a security interest in our accounts  instruments  and chattel paper upon its request in the event of a default as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our new subsidiary span medical products canada inc the credit facility includes financial covenants relating to tangible net worth and leverage ratios  and restricts mergers and acquisitions  assets sales  indebtedness  liens and capital expenditures 
the credit facility also restricts dividends and stock repurchases during any fiscal year to an aggregate amount of no more than of the sum of i our income from continuing operations for that fiscal year plus ii the absolute value of any aggregate after tax  non cash and extraordinary losses for that fiscal year 
as an exception to the restriction above  we may pay a regular quarterly dividend in an amount no greater than the previous quarter s regular dividend so long as we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to the payment of the dividend 
also  our new subsidiary is not restricted in its ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us 
violation of loan covenants could result in acceleration of the term of the agreement 
in november  we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
in february  the board expanded the repurchase program by  shares  bringing the total number of authorized shares to  as of october   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the expanded program at an average price of per share  representing a total investment of million 
considering these prior purchases  we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under the current program 
we intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market or in private transactions  depending on market and company conditions 
the stock repurchase program  however  may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
we believe that funds on hand  funds generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility are adequate to finance our operations and expected capital requirements during fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at october  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
for additional information regarding these obligations  see the referenced footnotes in the notes to financial statements under item below 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations note purchase obligations note deferred compensation note total contractual obligations on december   we borrowed  to finance a portion of the purchase price for the assets of mc healthcare and our canadian subsidiary entered into a year lease of the facilities at which the mc healthcare business is conducted with monthly rent of cdn  with an option to either purchase the facility at fair market value or to renew the lease for an additional years with rent at the then current market rate 
impact of inflation and cost of raw materials based on current conditions in the markets for our primary raw materials  we expect inflation to be a small to moderate factor for our operations in fiscal during the first two quarters of fiscal  we experienced relatively small price increases in several of our lower volume raw materials  which had minimal impact on our profitability 
however  in june and july of  we experienced additional price increases for most of our foam raw materials  which had a larger impact on our profitability 
in the medical segment  we expect the recent raw material cost increases to lower our gross margin during the next several quarters because our distribution agreements with several large medical customers require certain minimum notice periods before sales prices can be increased 
as a result of these contractual arrangements in the medical segment  there is often a lag between the time we receive raw material cost increases and the time we can increase a portion of our medical sales prices 
for both the medical and custom products segments  we will work to reduce the impact of raw material cost increases through a combination of actions targeted at preserving our margins 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset current or future cost increases  and the failure to do so could negatively affect our profitability 
the cost of polyurethane foam is indirectly influenced by oil prices 
however  other market factors also affect foam prices  including supply availability of chemicals used in the foam manufacturing process  demand for related products from domestic and international manufacturers  competition among domestic suppliers  our purchase volumes and regulatory requirements 
consequently  even though we expect inflation to be a small to moderate factor for our operations in fiscal  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the impact that inflation might have on our operations 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements that we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make forecasts about future events and their estimated impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the accounting policies more fully described in the notes to financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken to set credit limits for all customers 
we regularly evaluate past due accounts included in our accounts receivable and provide what we estimate to be adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer financial conditions may change and increase the risk of non collectability and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of october  and october  our provision for doubtful accounts was  this represented approximately of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end as compared to of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end reserve for obsolete and excess inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of future product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
as of october   our provision for excess and obsolete inventory represented approximately of total inventories  or  this compares with  or  of total inventories at fiscal year end the decline in our inventory reserve in both dollars and percent was caused by the sale or disposal of obsolete inventory during fiscal and the increase in inventory level at october  related to a promotional consumer order 
warranty obligations we warrant certain of our products for specific periods of time against manufacturing or performance defects 
we provide for the estimated future cost of warranty obligations in cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty cost represents our best estimate at the time of sale of the total cost that we will incur to repair or replace covered products or parts 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty cost is primarily based on historical experience as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty cost could differ from these estimated amounts 
in addition  we receive warranties from certain suppliers of key components of our products  and we rely on these suppliers to replace or provide credit for their defective goods that might be used in our products 
such replacements or credits reduce our direct warranty costs 
if our suppliers failed to honor their warranties  our warranty cost could increase 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if our estimated warranty costs were too low  we would be required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  which would negatively affect our operating results 
our actual warranty expense was approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal our accrued warranty costs at october   were  see note in the notes to financial statements for more information on product warranties 
impairment of goodwill the assets of our medical business include a significant amount of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill in our medical business unit for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our medical business unit 
for fiscal year end  we determined that the fair value of the medical business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment charge was required 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the medical business unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges  which would negatively impact operating results 
as of october   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
impairment of long lived assets impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is greater than its fair value 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in september of  which eliminated of the book value of the safety catheter assets 
we have attempted to sell the assets related to the safety catheter business  but our efforts so far have been unsuccessful 
proceeds from a future sale of these assets  if any  will be recorded as a gain on the disposition of assets from discontinued operations 
see note in the notes to financial statements 
present value of deferred compensation we are obligated under the terms of a retirement agreement to make fixed payments for the remaining lives of span america s founder and his ex wife as discussed in note deferred compensation in the notes to financial statements 
this obligation can be funded from internally generated cash or from the cash value of company owned life insurance policies  which had a value of million at october  see item a below and notes and in the notes to financial statements for more information on deferred compensation and the cash value of life insurance 
we have fully accrued the present value of the expected payments due over the combined estimated life expectancy of our founder and his ex wife 
in calculating this present value we used a discount rate of  which is an estimate of the effective long term rate of return on the portfolio 
if the actual rate of return was significantly lower than our estimate and we were required to accrue additional deferred compensation costs in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
as of october   we had recorded a deferred compensation liability of approximately  including current and long term portions 
if we reduced the discount rate by  the deferred compensation liability would be increased by approximately  and pre tax income would be reduced by the same amount 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk in three areas our short term investments  cash value of life insurance  and our credit facility 
as of october   we had short term investments of million  which were classified as available for sale 
these short term investments are high quality  highly liquid corporate commercial paper and bonds known as variable rate demand notes or low floaters 
the bonds are issued by municipalities or companies and are backed by letters of credit from federally insured banks 
the bonds carry the credit rating of the underlying bank 
the interest rate on the bonds is a floating rate which is reset weekly or monthly  depending on the issue  by the re marketing agent based on market rates for comparable securities or through an auction process 
we can liquidate the bonds at any time with a settlement date of seven days after the trade date 
using the level of securities available for sale at fiscal year end  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for one year would increase or decrease pre tax earnings by approximately  the effect of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates will vary from period to period with the dollar amount invested in our low floater portfolio 
other assets at october  included million in cash value of life insurance  which is subject to market risk related to equity pricing and interest rate changes 
the cash value is generated from life insurance policies that are being used as the funding vehicle for a retirement program for span america s founder and former chairman 
see present value of deferred compensation above 
the cash value is invested in a combination of fixed income life insurance contracts and a portfolio of mutual funds managed by an insurance company 
the fixed income contracts are similar to fixed income bond funds and are therefore subject to interest rate and company risk 
the mutual fund portfolios invest in common stocks and bonds in accordance with their individual investment objectives 
these portfolios are exposed to stock market and interest rate risk similar to comparable mutual funds 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates and the resulting changes in cash value of life insurance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
during the fiscal year ended october   cash value of life insurance increased by less than  creating after tax income of approximately  our credit facility accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our then applicable leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
interest is payable monthly 
there is an unused commitment fee associated with the line of credit beginning april  at basis points annual fee on any unused availability over  an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our financial condition and earnings to the extent that we had outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the degree of impact would vary depending on the level of the borrowings 
we repaid the outstanding balance of our long term debt during the first quarter of fiscal year and had no outstanding balance as of october  however on december   we borrowed  to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the assets of mc healthcare 
if the outstanding balance remains at this level for a year  an increase or decrease of basis points in the interest rate on our line of credit would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by in addition  as a result of the mc healthcare acquisition  we will manufacture and sell products in the us and canada 
revenues and costs will be incurred in both us and canadian dollars 
we will therefore be subject to realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation activities related to our operations 
these foreign exchange gains or losses could have a material effect on our results of operations
