matters related to our newark  new jersey terminal and the lower passaic river in september  we received a directive the directive issued by the njdep under the new jersey spill compensation and control act

the directive provided  among other things  that the recipients thereof must conduct an assessment of the natural resources that have been injured by the discharges into the lower passaic river and must implement interim compensatory restoration for the injured natural resources

there has been no material activity and or communications by njdep with respect to the directive since early after its issuance 
effective may  the united states environmental protection agency epa entered into an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent aoc with over parties comprising a cooperating parties group cpg many of whom also named in the directive who have collectively agreed to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs for the lower passaic river 
the company is a party to the aoc and is a member of the cpg 
the ri fs is intended to address the investigation and evaluation of alternative remedial actions with respect to alleged damages to the lower passaic river  and is scheduled to be completed in or about the ri fs does not resolve liability issues for remedial work or restoration of  or compensation for  natural resource damages to the lower passaic river  which are not known at this time

the company has answered the complaint  denying responsibility for any discharges of hazardous substances released into the passaic river 
the litigation is still in a pre trial stage with a significant amount of discovery remaining  particularly as to third parties 
we have made a demand upon chevron texaco for indemnity under certain agreements between the company and chevron texaco that allocate environmental liabilities for the newark terminal site between the parties 
in response  chevron texaco has asserted that the proceedings and claims are still not yet developed enough to determine the extent to which indemnities apply

d the year ended includes an income tax benefit recognized due to the elimination of  or reduction in  amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions related to being taxed as a c corp 
prior to our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the federal income tax laws in income taxes have not had a significant impact on our earnings since we first elected to be treated as a reit 
e in addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  our management also focuses on funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo to measure our performance 
ffo is generally considered to be an appropriate supplemental non gaap measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts reits 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  gains or losses on dispositions of real estate including such non ffo items reported in discontinued operations  extraordinary items  and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other reits may use definitions of ffo and or affo that are different than ours and  accordingly  may not be comparable 
we believe that ffo and affo are helpful to investors in measuring our performance because both ffo and affo exclude various items included in gaap net earnings that do not relate to  or are not indicative of  our fundamental operating performance 
ffo excludes various items such as gains or losses from property dispositions and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 
in our case  however  gaap net earnings and ffo typically include the impact of deferred rental revenue straight line rental revenue  the net amortization of above market and below market leases and income recognized from direct financing leases on its recognition of revenue from rental properties collectively the revenue recognition adjustments  as offset by the impact of related collection reserves 
gaap net earnings and ffo from time to time may also include impairment charges and or income tax benefits 
deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants 
in accordance with gaap  the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases are recognized on a straight line or an average basis rather than when the payment is contractually due 
the present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in place leases 
income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease term using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the leased property 
impairment of long lived assets represents charges taken to write down real estate assets to fair value estimated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in prior periods  income tax benefits have been recognized due to the elimination of  or a net reduction in  amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions related to being taxed as a c corp  rather than as a reit  prior to see note d above 
management pays particular attention to affo  a supplemental non gaap performance measure that we define as ffo less revenue recognition adjustments  impairment charges and income tax benefit 
in management s view  affo provides a more accurate depiction than ffo of our fundamental operating performance related to i the impact of scheduled rent increases from operating leases  ii the rental revenue from acquired in place leases  iii the impact of rent due from direct financing leases  iv our rental operating expenses exclusive of impairment charges  and v our election to be treated as a reit under the federal income tax laws beginning in neither ffo nor affo represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for gaap net earnings or as a measure of liquidity
