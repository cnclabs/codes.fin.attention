critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales allowances when providing for the appropriate sales returns  allowances  cash discounts and cooperative incentive promotion costs sales allowances  we apply a uniform and consistent method for making certain assumptions for estimating these provisions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments on a quarterly basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our primary product  cold eeze  has been clinically proven to reduce the severity and duration of common cold symptoms 
accordingly  factors considered in estimating the appropriate sales returns and allowances for this product include it being i a unique product with limited competitors  ii competitively priced  iii promoted  iv unaffected for remaining shelf life as there is no product expiration date  and v monitored for inventory levels at major customers and third party consumption data 
in addition to cold eeze  we market and distribute kids eeze chest relief  kids eeze cough cold and kids eeze allergy children otc cold remedies kids eeze products 
we introduced kids eeze chest relief in fiscal and expanded the product line to include kids eeze cough cold and kids eeze allergy in fiscal we also manufacturer  market and distribute an organic cough drop and a vitamin c supplement organix 
each of the kids eeze products and organix products do carry shelf life expiration dates for which we aggregate such new product market experience data and update its sales returns and allowances estimates accordingly 
sales allowances estimates are tracked at the specific customer and product line levels and are tested on an annual historical basis  and reviewed quarterly 
additionally  the monitoring of current occurrences  developments by customer  market conditions and any other occurrences that could affect the expected provisions relative to net sales for the period presented are also performed 
we do not impose a period of time within which product may be returned 
all requests for product returns must be submitted to us for pre approval 
the main components of our returns policy are i we will accept returns that are due to damaged product that is un saleable and such return request activity fall within an acceptable range  ii we will accept returns for products that have reached or exceeded designated expiration dates and iii we will accept returns in the event that we discontinue a product provided that the customer will have the right to return only such item that it purchased directly from us 
we will not accept return requests pertaining to customer inventory overstocking or resets 
we will only accept return requests for product in its intended package configuration 
we reserve the right to terminate shipment of product to customers who have made unauthorized deductions contrary to our return policy or pursue other methods of reimbursement 
we compensate the customer for authorized returns by means of a credit applied to amounts owed or to be owed and in the case of discontinued product only  also by way of an exchange 
we do not have any significant product exchange history 
we classify product returns into principally three categories  i non routine returns  ii obsolete product and iii product mix realignment by certain of our customers 
non routine returns are defined as product returned to us as a consequence of unanticipated circumstances principally due to i retail store closings or ii unexpected poor retail sell through to consumers causing us to discontinue the product 
obsolete returns are defined as product returned to us as a consequence of product shelf life use by expiration date 
product mix realignment returns are defined as product returned to us due to initiatives by the trade to discontinue purchasing certain of our products 
product mix realignment returns are generally nominal and are frequently related to discontinued or soon to be discontinued products 
our return policy accommodates returns for i discontinued products  ii store closings and iii products that have reached or exceeded designated expiration date 
the following is a summary of the change in the return provision for the years ended december  and in thousands amount return provision at december  net change in the return provision fiscal return provision at december  net change in the return provision fiscal return provision at december  for fiscal  and  net sales of products with limited shelf life and expiration dates were   and  respectively 
for fiscal  the return provision increased by  the increase in the return provision was principally due to i a charge of  including  for products with shelf life expiration dates obsolete returns offset by ii net returns of  associated principally with fiscal and fiscal received and processed during fiscal for fiscal  the return provision increased by  to million 
the increase in the return provision was principally due to i a charge of  for products with shelf life expiration dates obsolete returns offset by ii net returns associated with fiscal and fiscal received and processed during fiscal of  as a consequence of an increase in product returns experienced during the period 
we continue to experience higher than expected return provisions as a consequence of excess inventories at retail for new products launched in fiscal that carried limited shelf lives 
a one percent deviation for these sales allowance provisions for the fiscal  and would affect net sales by approximately   and  respectively 
a one percent deviation for cooperative incentive promotions reserve provisions for the years ended december   and could affect net sales by approximately   and  respectively 
income taxes as of december   we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal purposes that will expire beginning in fiscal through additionally  there are net operating loss carry forwards of million for state purposes that will expire beginning in fiscal through until sufficient taxable income to offset the temporary timing differences attributable to operations  the tax deductions attributable to option  warrant and stock activities are assured  a valuation allowance equaling the total deferred tax asset is being provided 
as a consequence of the accumulated losses of the company  management believes that this allowance is required due to the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits in the future 
seasonality of the business our sales are derived principally from our otc cold remedy products 
as a consequence  a significant portion of our business is highly seasonal  which causes major variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the third and fourth quarters generally represent the largest sales volume for our otc cold remedy products with a corresponding increase in marketing and advertising expenditures designed to promote our products during the cold season defined below 
in addition  our sales are influenced by and subject to fluctuations in the timing of purchase and the ultimate level of demand for our products which are a function of the timing  length and severity of each cold season 
generally  a cold season is defined as the period of september to march cold season when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors 
we track health and wellness trends and develop retail promotional strategies to align its production scheduling  inventory management and marketing programs to optimize consumer purchases 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal net sales decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in net sales is principally due i an acceleration in fiscal of our retail customer purchases and stocking for the cold season into the fourth quarter of fiscal which skewed net sales for that cold season  ii a decrease by our retail customers purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal in an effort to better align their purchases and inventory levels with the projected timing of the incidence levels of upper respiratory disorders during the cold season  iii a decrease associated with our retail customers reducing the number  timing and value of our promotional and or display programs as a consequence of  among other influences  a limited space availability  b allocation of more promotional space to private label brands and or other products and c a general reduction in off shelf  price promotion opportunities for the cold season 
in addition  our net sales of our contract manufacturing operations decreased  in fiscal to  as compared to million in fiscal due to i the decline in candy product sales as a consequence of the closure of the elizabethtown manufacturing facility in june and ii fluctuations in contract manufacturing orders from non related third party entities to produce lozenge based products 
data suggests that the highest incidence of upper respiratory disorders for the cold season occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal and were at significantly lower levels during the first  second and third quarters of fiscal when compared to the and prior cold seasons 
as a consequence  there was a reduced consumer demand at retail and therefore a corresponding reduction in retailer purchases and stocking during fiscal as compared to fiscal furthermore  a significant increase in the incidence of upper respiratory disorders for the cold season was not observed until late in the fourth quarter in fiscal our flagship product  cold eeze continues to compete for market share with new products entering the category and many retailer initiatives to reduce the number of products it carries on shelf within the cold and flu remedy category 
we are continuing to support cold eeze as a clinically proven cold remedy product through in store promotion  media advertising and coupon programs 
cost of sales decreased million for fiscal to million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cost of sales is principally due to i lower revenues from period to period  offset by ii an improvement in gross margin 
we realized gross margins of for fiscal as compared to in fiscal  an improvement of 
our improved gross margin reflects the net effect of i the elimination of the production and facility overhead expenses attributable to the closing of the elizabethtown manufacturing facility  ii improved production margins of the otc cold remedy segment  iii improved overhead cost management at our lebanon production and distribution facility  offset by iv an adverse impact of a reduction to net sales to absorb fixed production overhead expenses at our manufacturing facility and v increased product promotion with retailers to support the launch of our new products 
gross margins are influenced by fluctuations in quarter to quarter production volume  fixed production costs and related overhead absorption  and the timing of shipments to customers which are factors of the seasonality of our sales activities and products 
sales and marketing expense for fiscal increased  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to the net effect of i the implementation of more cost effective and targeted marketing programs  ii improved timing of marketing campaigns to better match the timing and product demand of the cold season  iii the discontinuation of certain ineffective marketing programs  offset by iv an increase in traditional media purchases in print  digital  out of home and television  and v an increase in marketing research and development costs associated with the development of new product packaging for our cold eeze and kids eeze product lines introduced during the cold season 
general and administrative g a expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in g a expense of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net effects of i a decrease in stock promotion costs of million  principally related to the board of directors proxy contest in fiscal and ii a decrease in professional fees and other expenses of  and iii a decrease of  in personnel expenses 
research and development costs for fiscal and were  and million  respectively 
the decrease of  in research and development costs for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a decline in the scope  timing and amount of research and development activity from period to period 
in fiscal and as a result of a strategic review  we determined to curtail and now have discontinued further investment in certain of our wholly owned subsidiary s  pharma  products then under development 
this was determined in light of our view concerning market opportunities  regulatory pathways  the need for further robust and consistent preclinical and clinical testing and continued requirements in the areas of commercial formulation and development 
however  we continue to engage in other research and development activities that we determine are appropriate and we may increase our research and development activities in future periods as a consequence of the joint venture 
interest and other income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal the increase of  for fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally the result of the allocation of funds into interest bearing accounts 
as noted above  we have net operating loss carry forwards for both federal and certain states 
for fiscal  we had a current tax benefit of  as a consequence of a carry back of an alternative minimum tax net operating loss to a prior period 
as a consequence of the effects of the above  the net loss for fiscal  was million  or 
per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal net sales decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in net sales is due to the net effect of i an increase in net sales of otc cold remedy products  of  offset by ii a decrease of net sales of contract manufacturing product of  which declined to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decline in contract manufacturing product sales is principally a result of the closure of the elizabethtown manufacturing facility and the elimination of certain low margin products 
net sales of otc cold remedy products have remained stable over the past two fiscal years as the cold and flu seasons have indicated comparable levels of the incidence of colds by consumers 
our flagship product  cold eeze continues to compete for market share with new products entering the category and many retailer initiatives to reduce the number of products it carries on shelf within the cold and flu remedy category 
we are continuing to support cold eeze as a clinically proven cold remedy product through in store promotion  media advertising and coupon programs 
cost of sales decreased  for fiscal to million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cost of sales is principally due to i lower revenues from period to period and ii an improvement in gross margin 
we realized gross margins of for fiscal as compared to in fiscal  an improvement of 
the increase in the gross margin was principally due to the net effect of i the elimination of the production and facility overhead expenses attributable to the closing of the elizabethtown manufacturing facility  ii improved production margins of the otc cold remedy products  offset by iii an adverse impact to net sales as a consequence of the inventory reduction programs maintained by our larger retail customers 
gross margins are influenced by fluctuations in quarter to quarter production volume  fixed production costs and related overhead absorption  and the timing of shipments to customers which are factors of the seasonality of our sales activities and products 
sales and marketing expense for fiscal decreased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to as we implemented more efficient in store  digital and consumer based marketing initiatives versus print and radio advertising programs launched in fiscal g a expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the increase in g a expense of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net effects of i an increase in stock promotion costs of million  principally related to board of directors proxy contest and ii an increase in professional fees and other expenses of  offset by  iii a decrease of million in personnel costs principally due to a decrease in executive salaries  bonuses and head count 
research and development costs for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenditure of million in was principally the result of i decreased pharma study costs of million and ii a reduction in personnel costs of  the decreased spending for the fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to i the completion of the phase iib study for qr diabetic peripheral neuropathy in november and ii a subsequent slowdown in related fiscal spending pending the availability of the final results of the study 
in addition  we strategically determined to curtail and ultimately suspend further investment certain of pharma s then existing products under development in light of our view concerning market opportunities  regulatory pathways  the need for further robust and consistent preclinical and clinical testing and continued requirements in the areas of commercial formulation and development 
as noted above  we have net operating loss carry forwards for both federal and certain states 
however  effective december   we elected to conform our tax reporting year  historically a fiscal period ending september  to our financial reporting period ending december as a consequence  we will file a full period tax return for the fiscal year ended september  with the internal revenue service irs and will also file with the irs a short period return for the three months ended december  in compliance with the election 
for fiscal  we had a current tax benefit of  for certain federal and state alternative minimum income taxes incurred for the short period return  inclusive of an alternative minimum tax refund due us of  as a consequence of a carry back of an alternative minimum tax net operating loss to a prior period 
in future fiscal periods  our tax and financial reporting periods will be the same  the period ending december as a consequence of the effects of the above  the net loss for fiscal  was million  or 
per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our aggregate cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million compared to million at december  our working capital was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
changes in working capital for fiscal were principally due to the net effect of i cash used in operations of million  ii capital expenditures of  iii the cash payment of million to acquire the product license in connection with the joint venture  offset by  iv proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
significant factors impacting working capital for fiscal included i an increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances  offset by  ii an increase in other accrued advertising and other allowances 
management believes that its strategy to maintain cold eeze as a recognized brand name  its broader range of products  its adequate manufacturing capacity  together with its current working capital  should provide an internal source of capital to fund normal business operations 
our operations support the current research and development expenditures related to new products 
in addition to the funding from operations  we may in the short and long term raise capital through the issuance of securities or secure other financing sources to support such product development research  new product acquisitions or a venture investment or acquisition 
such funding through the issuance of equity securities would result in the dilution of current stockholders ownership in the company 
should our product development initiatives progress on certain formulations  additional development expenditures may require substantial financial support and may necessitate the consideration of alternative approaches such as licensing  joint venture  or partnership arrangements that we determine will meet our long term goals and objectives 
ultimately  should internal working capital be insufficient and external funding methods or other business arrangements become unattainable  it would likely result in the deferral or abandonment of future development relative to current and prospective product development initiatives and formulations 
management is not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material negative impact upon our i short term or long term liquidity  or ii net sales or income from continuing operations 
any challenge to our patent rights could have a material adverse effect on our future  however  we are not aware of any condition that would make such an event probable 
our business is subject to seasonal variations thereby impacting liquidity and working capital during the course of our fiscal year 
management believes that cash generated from operations  along with its current cash balances  will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the longer term  as previously discussed  we may require additional capital to support  among other items  i new product introductions  ii expansion of our product marketing and promotion activities  iii additional research development activities  iv further investment in our joint venture  iv venture investments or acquisitions and or v support current operations 
since late fiscal  there has been substantial volatility and a decline in the capital and financial markets due at least in part to the constricted global economic environment resulting in substantial uncertainty and access to financing is uncertain 
moreover  consumer and as a consequence  customer spending habits may be adversely affected by the current economic crisis 
these conditions could have an adverse effect on our industry and business  including our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to incur indebtedness to finance plans for growth 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and the potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings  under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms that we believe to be reasonable  if at all 
our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consist of the following year employment contracts advertising total total additional advertising costs are expected to be incurred during fiscal off balance sheet arrangements it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees on loans and financial commitments and retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity for securitization purposes 
consequently  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation we are subject to normal inflationary trends and anticipate that any increased costs would be passed on to our customers 
inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the sec issued for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
under the proposed roadmap  we could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs 
the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb modified the accounting standard related to consolidation 
this standard  as modified  intends to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this standard  as modified  addresses the effects on certain provisions relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities  as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept in the accounting standard related to transfers and servicing  and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of this standard  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the standard do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this standard  as modified  is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the adoption of the consolidation standard  as modified  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
amends guidance included within asc topic to require an entity to use an estimated selling price when vendor specific objective evidence or acceptable third party evidence does not exist for any products or services included in a multiple element arrangement 
the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the products and services based upon their relative selling prices  thus eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation 
asu no 
also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding significant judgments made and changes in applying this guidance 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application are also permitted 
we elected to adopt asu no 
early and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu amends asu to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the amended guidance requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers  the reasons for any transfers in or out of level  and information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
this asu also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements as well as the level of disaggregation required for each class of asset and liability disclosed 
the amended level and guidance is effective for interim and annual financial periods beginning after december  while the amended level guidance is effective for interim and annual financial periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like virtually all commercial enterprises  we can be exposed to the risk market risk that the cash flows to be received or paid relating to certain financial instruments could change as a result of changes in interest rate  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
our operations are not subject to risks of material foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment practices 
we place our marketable investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
we do not expect material losses with respect to our investment portfolio or excessive exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
the impact on our results of one percentage point change in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair value  or cash flows related to investments in cash equivalents or interest earning marketable securities 
current economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance including the collection of accounts receivables  realization of inventory and recoverability of assets 
in addition  our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions  including a reduction in the availability of credit  financial market volatility and recession
