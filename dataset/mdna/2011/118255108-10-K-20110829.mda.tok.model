item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur  it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclical changes caused by general global and industry conditions 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
furthermore  a general economic downturn in a particular country or on an international scale could reduce the overall sales within our industry  thereby likely reducing our sales 
we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create a surplus capacity of the goods that we sell  which might cause us to either lose sales or lower the prices of our goods 
actions by our competitors and any surplus capacity could cause our sales and profits to decline  affecting our operating results and financial condition 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely affect our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
we have raw material pricing and availability issues at our memphis and americana specialty fiber plants 
we have the option to import cotton linters for our memphis specialty cotton fiber production in order to minimize the impact of unexpected fluctuations in north american cotton fiber availability 
we have limited production at our americana  brazil and memphis specialty fibers facilities because of raw material constraints 
this raw material availability constraint will limit growth and continue to impact our production costs 
energy and chemical costs which had increased substantially in recent years  resulting in increased production costs for our products  have recently moderated 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck  rail and international shipping could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
an increase in international shipping rates or fuel surcharges or a reduction in the availability of vessels could negatively impact our costs and our ability to provide products to our international customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 
risks related to our business exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
our indebtedness levels could adversely affect us 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business if it were to increase significantly from current levels 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
from time to time  credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results  actions that we take  their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy 
actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining  upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading 
downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets  increase our cost of financing  and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operation and financial condition 
any of our manufacturing facilities  or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  an equipment failure  a chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  labor difficulties  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hurricanes or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  governmental regulations  and other operational problems 
we may be required to pay significant export taxes or countervailing and anti dumping duties for exported products 
we may experience reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses as a result of export taxes or countervailing and anti dumping duty applications 
it is possible that countervailing duty and antidumping tariffs  or similar types of tariffs could be imposed on us in the future 
these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial results and financial condition 
the impacts of climate related initiatives  at the international  federal and state levels  remain uncertain at this time 
currently  there are numerous international  federal and state level initiatives and proposals addressing domestic and global climate issues 
within the us  most of these proposals would regulate and or tax  in one fashion or another  the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere  and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more clean energy 
for example  in the us house of representatives passed the markey waxman bill hr  which would establish a so called cap and trade regime and new permitting requirements to regulate greenhouse gas generation  as well as provide an incentive for the production and use of clean energy 
to date  the us senate has not passed any comparable legislation 
in sum  we believe that the potential for climate change legislation on the federal level is unknown 
in addition  in late  the us epa issued an endangerment finding under the clear air act caa with respect to carbon dioxide  which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the caa and have significant ramifications for us and the industry in general 
on the international front  the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen  which took place in december  did not result in any significant progress toward a binding agreement to replace the kyoto protocol  which expires in we are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel 
we believe that our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel 
our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
as of august   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida and memphis  tennessee 
our foley plant s labor agreement is in effect through april  the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  on november   union employees at our canadian facility ratified a new labor agreement 
the agreement is in effect through june  employee representation is provided by a national union for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and a works council at our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumberton and king  north carolina are not unionized 
the failure to renegotiate labor agreements in a timely manner could lead to a curtailment or stoppage of work at our factories 
if we negotiated a labor agreement on unfavorable terms  our production costs will increase 
a reduction in production or increasing the costs of production would lower our profits and harm our business 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely affect our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
such environmental laws and regulations at the federal level include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  the clean air act of  as amended  the clean water act of  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  the toxic substances control act of  as amended  and the safe drinking water act of  as amended 
these environmental regulatory programs are primarily administered by the us environmental protection agency epa 
in addition  the individual states and foreign countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt in the future equivalent or more stringent environmental laws and regulations or have enacted their own parallel environmental programs 
we closely monitor our environmental compliance with current environmental requirements and believe that we are in substantial compliance 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements  including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions  such as emissions of greenhouse gases  and general permitting requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
we also expect that we will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
any failure on our part to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to penalties or other sanctions that could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we cannot currently assess  however  the impact that more stringent environmental requirements may have on our operations or capital expenditure requirements 
we do not anticipate that capital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance will have a material effect on our earnings during fiscal year compliance with recently passed legislation may adversely affect our business 
in march  congress passed the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  the acts 
among other things  the acts contain provisions that will affect employer sponsored health care plans  impose excise taxes on certain plans  and reduce the tax benefits available to employers that receive the medicare part d subsidy 
we are currently reviewing provisions of the acts and their impact on our company sponsored plans 
we are currently unable to estimate costs associated with compliance with the acts 
we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in over countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united states represented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the us dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our industries and business and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products  capacity changes  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  our growth rate and our competitors growth rates  the financial market and general economic conditions  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors or our industry generally  or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  and changes in accounting principles 
in addition  there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in our industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could result in substantial costs and would divert management s attention and resources

as of june   the americana plant operated at about of its capacity 
nonwovens plants the stated capacity of airlaid nonwovens machines is based upon an assumed mix of products 
the flexible nature of airlaid technology allows for a wide range of materials to be produced 
machine production capability has typically been lower than the stated capacity  often by factors of  when adjusted to reflect the actual product mix 
based on current product mix  utilization of our airlaid machines worldwide  as of june   was approximately of their capacity 
delta plant 
the delta plant is located in delta  british columbia on a acre industrial park site and has a total capacity of approximately  annual metric tons of airlaid nonwovens  based on current production mix from two production lines 
during the second quarter of  we completed the consolidation of all production at this facility on the newer of the two machines at the site  which has an annual production capacity of approximately  tons per year

all of the facilities located in the united states are pledged as collateral for certain debt agreements 
we believe that our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials manufacturing facilities and administrative buildings are adequate to meet current operating demands 
item legal proceedings we are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess the probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
we believe the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results from operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discusses our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies and estimates 
unless otherwise indicated  references to a year eg  refers to our fiscal year ended june of that year 
executive summary we manufacture and distribute value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  cigarette filters  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
the key focus areas for buckeye over the next twelve months include maximizing cash flow  optimizing capacity utilization  completing the foley energy project  identifying new initiatives that support profitable  sustainable growth  addressing under performing assets and accelerating the rate of change to a lean enterprise culture 
we plan to take a balanced approach in allocating capital between debt reduction  investment in high rate of return projects  and returning value to shareholders 
net sales for were a record million  up million or from million in  primarily driven by higher selling prices 
specialty fibers segment sales were up and sales in the nonwoven materials segment were up 
higher selling prices had a positive million impact on sales compared to  while favorable mix explained the rest of the increase in sales 
market shipment volume was off for our specialty fibers segment but was up for our nonwovens segment 
significantly higher selling prices for our high end specialty wood and cotton fibers high purity cellulose were driven by strong demand from emerging markets and tight supply conditions in this segment of the market  accounting for million of the year over year increase in sales 
fluff pulp prices were up year over year  also driven by rapidly growing demand for disposable diapers and other absorbent products in the emerging markets  and this accounted for an additional million of the annual sales growth 
nonwovens selling prices were up about million year over year  as higher input costs were partially passed through to our customers 
operating income for was million compared to million in in we recognized million in income from the alternative fuel mixture credit which did not repeat in  and operating income was reduced by a million non cash fixed asset impairment charge related to the announced planned closure of our delta  bc  canada airlaid facility in december total gross margin increased by million  due to significantly higher selling prices across all parts of our specialty fibers segment partly offset by a significant increase in cotton linter costs along with more modest increases in the costs of wood  chemicals and transportation 
gross margin as a percentage of sales improved from to 
selling  research and administrative expenses of million were up million over the prior year primarily due to higher employee bonus and stock compensation accruals 
net income for was a record million  or per diluted share  up million or per diluted share compared to net income for includes a benefit of  related to cellulosic biofuel credits offset by related interest payable to the irs for the use fo funds from afmc refunds expected to be exchanged for cbc 
lower net income from the afmc and cbc accounted for a reduction in earnings per share between and  and the fixed asset impairment charge accounted for an additional reduction of 
net income and earnings per share improved compared to the prior year in spite of these two items due to higher selling prices in the specialty fibers segment and reduced interest expense due to the million debt reduction achieved over the course of the year 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million  including approximately million from the afmc and cbc  enabling us to fund million in capital expenditures  reduce total debt by million  pay out dividends of million to our shareholders  and spend million on share repurchases 
this was an improvement of million over net cash provided by operating activities in  which included approximately million in cash provided by the afmc 
while these energy tax credits contributed million toward the growth in cash flow year over year  the rest of the growth was due to net income offset by about a million unfavorable swing in working capital as we rebuilt finished goods inventory at foley after the power outage in june and also rebuilt our raw materials inventory of cotton linters relative to the same date a year ago 
our capital spending for the year just completed was million 
this included million in spending on the florida energy project  which is on schedule to be completed in the october december quarter of with full startup in the first quarter of calendar year  as well as million for the purchase of land contiguous to the foley site 
over the past three fiscal years  the afmc  which expired on december   have generated significant net income and cash flow for buckeye  and have allowed us to reach our debt reduction goals much more quickly than would have otherwise been the case 
during and  the afmc generated million in operating income and added million in net income or per share 
on a cumulative basis through  the afmc has generated total cash flow of million for buckeye since we began earning these credits in february in july  the irs office of chief counsel released legal advice concluding that black liquor sold or used before january   qualifies for cbc tax credits of per gallon 
we filed amended tax returns in august to claim cbcs on black liquor burned during the january  to february  period before we started mixing with diesel fuel and qualifying for the afmc 
in addition  buckeye is allowed to trade the cent per gallon afmcs we received in calendar year for per gallon in cbcs less applicable taxes less interest 
the net after tax benefit recorded in our financial statements related to cbc is million 
we plan to update our projections annually and could recognize more or less of the total potential benefit from this credit in future years 
on august   the board of directors announced buckeye s first ever quarterly dividend of per share  which was subsequently increased to per share for the dividend payable on march   and then increased again to per share for the dividend payable on september  with approximately million shares outstanding  this currently represents a l million annual distribution of cash to shareholders 
this in essence is cash flow that was formerly used to reduce our debt and pay our interest expense and now will be used to return cash to shareholders 
our objectives for returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends are to increase shareholder returns and to broaden our shareholder base 
we expect that buckeye will continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to pay this dividend and grow it over time while also continuing to invest in high return projects and growth opportunities  and to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis under our remaining million share authorization as of june  results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs alternative fuel mixture credits other operating income operating income loss net sales in versus increased by million or  primarily due to higher selling prices in both segments  accounting for an increase of million 
both segments also experienced favorable product mix  which contributed an additional million to the higher sales number  partially offset by lower volume and unfavorable exchange rates in europe 
our gross margin was million better than and improved as a percentage of net sales from in to in this improvement was due to the higher selling prices 
raw material costs were up significantly for our cotton specialty fibers and nonwovens products compared to  but wood costs were only modestly higher 
chemical  freight and direct costs were up  while natural gas costs were slightly lower 
the final insurance settlement related to the june power outage at our foley plant added million to our gross margin  representing a partial recovery of the million in lost margin from business interruption and property damage 
net sales increased slightly for versus higher volume in both wood specialty products and nonwoven materials was mostly offset by lower pricing and unfavorable product mix in both segments 
we also experienced lower volume in cotton specialty products as we reduced our production to match raw material availability 
gross margin in versus improved by million on the increased sales volume and increased as a percent of net sales from to 
our costs were down significantly year over year  but reductions in cost were mostly offset by lower selling prices and unfavorable sales mix 
we experienced lower raw material prices million  primarily for cotton linter fibers and fluff pulp  although prices for both started increasing in the second half of in addition  chemical prices were lower by million and energy prices were lower by million 
direct cost spending was up about million year over year in spite of significant reductions at our memphis specialty cotton fibers plant mainly due to higher shipment volumes  increased maintenance spending and higher bonus accruals 
only million of this increase in direct cost spending was due to the june power outage 
selling  research and administrative expenses increased million in as a result of higher bonus and stock compensation expense  due to improved profit  cash flow  safety and quality and a higher stock price 
selling  research and administrative expenses increased million in due mainly to higher bonus and stock compensation expense which offset the impact of lower employment 
as a percentage of net sales these costs decreased to in versus in and in based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  during the three months ended march   we completed this analysis 
we concluded that there was no change to the impairment loss of million we recognized at december  since this goodwill impairment charge is non cash  it did not affect our liquidity or financial covenants 
on june   we announced our decision to close our delta  bc  canada airlaid nonwovens facility by the end of calendar we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets at the delta facility and determined that these long lived assets were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value resulting in an impairment charge of million 
we recorded million and million in afmcs  which were net of expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations for the years and  respectively 
during and we received million and million  respectively  in cash refunds through the filing of periodic excise tax refund claims 
we claimed million as income tax credits on our tax return and million as income tax credits on our tax return which reduced our cash taxes in by an additional million 
we have treated the credits received in cash as taxable income and the income tax credits as non taxable income 
the afmcs are subject to audit by the irs 
the credit expired on december  segment results although nonwoven materials processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment consists of our chemical cellulose  customized fibers and fluff pulp product lines which are cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
the nonwovens materials segment consists of our airlaid plants and our converting plant 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administrative expenses to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  the impact of goodwill impairment loss  long lived asset impairments  alternative fuel mixture credits  amortization of intangibles  and unallocated at risk and stock based compensation

average selling prices for high end specialty wood fibers grades were up  reflecting strong market conditions and improved mix 
fluff pulp prices were up in versus driven by a rapidly growing demand for absorbent products in emerging markets 
prices for specialty cotton grades were up as higher costs for cotton linters were passed through based on provisions included in our long term sales agreements 
adding to the sales improvement were favorable product mix and higher shipment volume from our memphis plant 
as of june   more than of our memphis plant s specialty cotton fibers business is committed to contracts that allow us to commit to longer procurement agreements for cotton linters 
this is providing improved control of cost and flow of products to our customers 
operating income increased by million in versus and improved as a percentage of net sales from in to in this improvement was driven by the higher pricing and improved product sales mix 
the successful january start up of phase i of our energy project s turbine generator at our specialty wood fibers mill contributed to our improved gross margin 
improved capacity utilization at our memphis specialty cotton fibers plant also contributed to the higher gross margin as we experienced some improvement in the availability of cotton linters 
partially offsetting these items were higher raw material prices million mainly due to the higher cost for cotton linters 
direct costs increased due mainly to higher spending on maintenance and higher bonus accruals 
in addition we experienced higher chemical and transportation costs 
net sales decreased in versus higher shipment volume had a positive million impact on sales compared to  while lower selling prices and unfavorable mix reduced sales by million 
fluff pulp pricing decreased by per ton 
prices for high end specialty wood grades were down  primarily due to cost pass through provisions included in our annual sales agreements 
prices for specialty cotton grades were down reflecting lower costs for cotton linters 
unfavorable product sales mix also contributed to the lower sales 
shipment volume for the segment was up  as shipment volume for specialty wood fibers increased by  but shipment volume was lower by for specialty cotton fibers 
operating income for improved by million compared to in spite of a million drop in sales revenue  largely due to the return to profitability of our memphis cotton specialty fibers plant 
our gross margin for this plant improved by million due to a combination of lower raw material costs  chemical costs  energy costs and headcount and other direct cost reductions  although as a percentage of sales  it is still below the average for the total specialty fibers segment 
total gross margin for our wood specialty products was down about million year over year due to sales mix and the million impact of a power outage and voltage surge at our florida specialty fibers facility in june 
operating margin as a percentage of sales for the specialty fibers segment improved from to 
we also saw a reduction in finished goods inventory in the specialty fibers segment  partly due to  tons of lost production in june at the foley plant due to the power outage 
inventories were below sustainable levels both at the foley plant and at the memphis plant at the end of  and were rebuilt during the first six months of nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income operating margin percentage nonwoven materials sales increased in versus by million or  primarily due to higher selling prices and higher shipment volume 
selling prices were up approximately and shipment volume was up approximately 
operating income decreased in versus as higher raw material costs  mainly due to the rapid rise in fluff pulp costs in  more than offset higher selling prices 
nonwoven materials sales increased in versus airlaid shipment volume improved by  offsetting lower prices and unfavorable product mix 
operating income increased in versus in addition to benefiting from the increased shipment volume and improved capacity utilization  operating margin improved from to as price decreases lagged reductions in raw material costs primarily fluff pulp 
this trend of expanding margins during times of falling raw material costs reversed course in mid year as fluff pulp prices started to rapidly escalate  with operating margin for the fourth quarter down to 
corporate our intercompany net sales elimination represents intercompany sales from our florida and memphis specialty fiber facilities to our airlaid nonwovens plants

we plan to consolidate a portion of the delta facility s production at our two other airlaid nonwovens facilities 
we believe that this closure and consolidation of business will improve capacity utilization  profitability and return on invested capital for our nonwovens business 
we expect to eventually sell the land  building and equipment 
as a result of this decision  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets at the delta facility 
based on this evaluation  we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million  were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
restructuring costs in  we announced the consolidation of production at our delta  british columbia  canada airlaid facility on the newer of the two machines at that site 
the cost of this consolidation was approximately million  million of which remains to be paid 
during  we implemented a restructuring program to sharpen our focus on key priorities which included restructuring our ultra fiber sales force  aligning capacity utilization with current market conditions at our memphis plant  and reducing selling  research and administrative expenses 
the total cost of this program was million  million of which remains to be paid 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated and employees were transferred from selling  research and administrative positions to management positions at our florida facility 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus interest expense decreased due to debt reduction of million and lower annual interest rates of approximately basis points 
the decrease was slightly offset by million of accrued interest payable to the irs for the use of funds from afmc refunds expected to be exchanged for cbc 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus interest expense decreased due to debt reduction of million and a reduction of approximately basis points in our average interest rate 
gain loss on early extinguishment of debt costs during  we used borrowings under our credit facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes 
as a result of this extinguishment  we recorded a million loss which included a million premium paid to the note holders and million of unamortized deferred financing costs 
during  we used borrowings under our credit facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes 
as a result of this extinguishment  we recorded a million non cash gain which was the net of the deferred financing costs  offset by the remaining unamortized interest rate swap early termination fee 
we also used cash and borrowings to redeem million of our notes 
as a result of this extinguishment  we recorded million in losses which included redemption price premiums of million and non cash write off of deferred financing costs of million 
during  we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to purchase million of our notes at a discount of 
as a result of this extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs 
the net of the discount and the deferred financing costs resulted in a gain of million 
see note  long term debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the loss in was primarily due to foreign currency losses as a result of the strengthening of the euro  canadian dollar and brazilian real versus the us dollar 
the loss in was primarily due to foreign currency losses as a result of the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
the loss in was primarily due to a settlement fee in certain litigation and a charge related to the termination of hedge accounting treatment on an interest rate swap 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in and in during  we recorded tax benefits of million for cbcs claimed on black liquor without diesel for the period january  through february   and million for exchange of cbcs from afmcs 
see note for further discussion 
during and  we claimed the afmcs as cash refunds through the filing of periodic excise tax refund claims and as income tax credits on the federal income tax returns filed for the and tax years 
for purposes of calculating federal and state income taxes  we treat the credits claimed as cash refunds of excise tax as taxable income and the credits claimed on the federal income tax return as nontaxable income 
in and  we recorded tax benefits of million and million  respectively  due to the nontaxable nature of the afmcs claimed on the federal income tax return 
during  and we recorded domestic manufacturing deductions of million  million and million  respectively 
the large increase in this deduction in was due to an increase in the applicable percentage from to and the increase in taxable income 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of expanded the irc section energy investment tax credit to include qualified property for facilities producing electricity using open loop biomass 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of million relating to this tax credit  of which million relates to expenditures prior to june  and million relates to expenditures 
in  we recorded an additional million tax benefit relating to this tax credit 
we expect to realize continuing benefits from the energy investment tax credit which will reduce our effective tax rate over the next several years based on planned spending on energy projects at our foley mill 
on december  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge and we recognized a tax benefit of million in connection with the goodwill impairment charge 
we increased our valuation allowance from million to million during primarily due to operating losses in brazil and canada 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during with another million in debt reduction 
we plan to take a balanced approach in allocating capital between debt reduction  investment in high rate of return projects  and returning cash to shareholders 
liquidity and capitalization on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement credit facility which increased our maximum committed borrowing capacity to million and extended the maturity date of the facility to october  we used the proceeds from the credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former credit facility plus fees and expenses 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility is the agent s prime rate plus to  or a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus  based on a grid related to our leverage ratio 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
the costs for the issuance of this credit facility were million and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the facility 
the credit facility contains covenants customary for financing of this type 
the financial covenants include maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
at june   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit facility 
at june   we had million of cash and million borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility is per annum 
our total debt decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june   as compared to at june  and at june  while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the next twenty four months 
treasury stock at june   a total of million shares have been repurchased under authorizations by our board of directors to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
repurchased shares  if any  are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans

we did not repurchase any shares during cash flow cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income loss noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit payments on long term debt other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities in  cash provided by operating activities increased million over the majority of the increase was due to an increase of million in tax refunds  most of which was attributed to the afmcs 
gross margin was significantly higher in versus but was partially offset by higher accounts receivable  due to higher sales prices  and an increase in working capital as we rebuilt inventory to more sustainable levels 
cash flows from operating activities in increased million over while the million positive impact of the afmc on cash flow was million less than in  the income tax refund from received in included million in section investment tax credits related to the foley energy project 
in addition  working capital was reduced by million during as reductions in finished goods inventory and increased payables more than offset an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment increased million in which included the purchase of  acres bordering our foley facility for million and a million increase in spending on the foley energy project 
we expect efficiency improvement and energy saving projects  maintenance capital and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately to million for  of which million will be for the foley energy project 
during  we spent million on this project  which is on schedule to be complete with full startup in the first quarter of a portion of the spending for this project was partly funded by the million state of florida grant received in september through  we have spent million million in capital and million in expense of this three year  million project  which involves the installation of a steam turbine generator and upgrade of two recovery boilers  and is expected to save the equivalent of  barrels of oil per year and improve the energy self sufficiency of our foley plant from about to about 
we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with environmental obligations at our foley plant specialty fibers facility 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors  including when the final npdes permit is issued and its final terms and conditions 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements see note  recent accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectability of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
we increased tax expense by million in  by million in and by million in by changes to our valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
on july  we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we record our unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included as a component of income before income taxes 
cellulosic biofuel credits cellulosic biofuel credits cbc are recognized based on our expected ability to utilize the cbc prior to expiration 
estimating the amount of the benefit recognized requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future profitability affecting the realization of these tax benefits 
the key assumptions in estimating future profitability relate to future selling prices and volumes  operating reliability  raw material  energy  chemical and freight costs  and various other projected operating factors as reflected in our internal planning models including interest cost and the impact of currency exchange rates 
these models take into account recent sales and cost data as well as macroeconomic drivers including gross domestic product growth  customer demand and industry capacity 
other assumptions affecting estimates of future taxable income include  significant book to tax differences impacting future credit utilization  cost recovery of existing and future capital assets and the domestic manufacturing deduction 
our current forecasts of these book to tax differences are based on expected capital acquisitions and operating results  respectively 
significant changes to any of these key assumptions could have a material impact on the estimate of cbc utilization 
as key factors in these models change in future periods  we will update our projections and revise the estimate of the cbc benefit expected to be utilized 
such changes to the estimate may be significant 
for  we recognized million of income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations related to the expected incremental benefit from exchanging previously claimed afmc for cbc 
as of june   we have estimated that we will not be able to utilize approximately million of the additional benefit from the available cbc and have not recognized any benefit in our consolidated statement of operations related to this amount 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to utilize the remaining available cbc and will record any related changes in estimates when our expected utilization of the available cbcs change 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method which is based on the expected productive hours of the assets  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets is determined to not be recoverable  we measure the potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
no circumstances existed in to indicate the carrying value of any of our assets may not be recoverable 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have previously adopted asc intangibles goodwill and other  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
on june   we announced our decision to close our delta  bc  canada airlaid nonwovens facility by the end of calendar our decision was due to several factors including unfavorable site location relative to customers and raw material suppliers  a strong canadian dollar  and low capacity utilization 
we plan to consolidate production at our two other airlaid nonwovens facilities 
we believe that this closure and consolidation of business will improve capacity utilization  profitability and return on invested capital for our nonwovens business 
we expect to eventually sell the land  building and equipment 
in june  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets at the delta facility in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the results of this test indicated that the delta assets were impaired as the sum of the undiscounted cash flow analysis was less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
as such  the impairment test was performed to determine the estimated fair value of the long lived assets compared to their carrying value 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist with this impairment testing and fair value determination 
the impairment was the amount that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the assets estimated as the value in exchange of the underlying asset group using market and cost valuation approaches which exceeded the operating value of the asset group 
based on this evaluation  we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million  were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were both million and at june  were million and respectively 
we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding on june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to libor rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
we and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we do not have any hedges in place to protect against fluctuations in any of these currencies  but we do sometimes hedge this exposure 
our euro exposure is internally hedged for the most part because a high percentage of both the sales and costs at our steinfurt  germany plant are denominated in euros 
we estimate that the negative pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the euro usd euro rate on our operating income is about million annually 
we estimate the positive pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the canadian dollar usd cad exchange rate at about million annually 
we estimate the positive pre tax impact of a strengthening of the usd versus the brazilian real usd brl exchange rate at about million annually 
we are continuously evaluating our foreign currency exposure and our hedging policy is subject to change 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
as of june   we had options in place to purchase  mmbtus of natural gas at prices ranging from to per mmbtu through november as of june   we had contracts in place to purchase  mmbtus of natural gas at various fixed prices through december
