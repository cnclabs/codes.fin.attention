item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture and sell versatile and high performance video infrastructure products and system solutions that enable our customers to efficiently create  prepare and deliver broadcast and on demand video services to televisions  personal computers and mobile devices 
historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from sales of video processing solutions and network edge and access systems to cable television operators and from sales of video processing solutions to direct to home satellite operators 
more recently  we are providing our video processing solutions to telecommunications companies  or telcos  broadcasters and other media companies that create video programming or offer video services 
in september  we acquired omneon  inc  a private  venture backed company specializing in file based infrastructure for the production  preparation and playout of video content typically deployed by broadcasters  satellite operators  content owners and other media companies 
the acquisition of omneon is complementary to harmonic s core business  expanding our customer reach into content providers and extending our product lines into video servers and video optimized storage for content production and playout 
harmonic s net revenue increased by in from the increase in net revenue in  compared to  was in part due to stronger worldwide customer demand for video processing solutions 
the growth in video processing revenue of also contributed to the growth in service and support activity related to the associated video processing solutions  thus resulting in services and support revenue growth of in  when compared to in addition  harmonic s revenue also increased as a result of the acquisition of omneon in september and its inclusion in our results from the date of acquisition 
omneon s product revenue  which for was million  is included in the production and playout product line 
we also experienced an improved gross margin percentage in  compared to  primarily due to a more favorable mix of revenue towards higher gross margin products  such as video processing and production and playout 
further  when comparing to  note that in we recorded a charge of approximately million to cost of revenue  primarily consisting of excess and obsolete inventories expenses from product discontinuances and severance expenses for 
table of contents terminated scopus employees  which lowered margins relative to margins 
our operating results in also included total charges of million related to acquisition costs and excess facilities associated with the omneon purchase and subsequent consolidation of omneon personnel into our san jose  california facility 
harmonic s net revenue decreased by in from the decrease in revenues in  compared to  was primarily due to weaker demand in from our domestic cable and satellite customers  and our european cable customers  for edge products and solutions primarily related to vod  switched digital video  modular cable modem termination systems  or m cmts  deployments  and hdtv  offset by increased revenue resulting from the acquisition of scopus of million 
we experienced a lower gross margin percentage in  compared to  primarily due to the previously mentioned charge to cost of revenue in associated with the scopus operations  lower gross margins on sales of edge and access products due to competitive pricing pressures and the deployment of our then current nsg platform  which platform carries lower initial gross margins than our average gross margins  and increased amortization of intangibles expense 
our operating results in included a charge of million for acquisition costs associated with the scopus acquisition 
financial difficulties of certain of our customers and changes in our customers deployment plans have adversely affected our business in the past 
in and  economic conditions in many of the countries in which we sell products were very weak  and global economic conditions and financial markets experienced a severe downturn 
the downturn stemmed from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  rapid changes in foreign exchange rates  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
although there was an increase in global economic activity in  economic growth may remain sluggish during in a few developed countries and in some emerging market countries 
the severity or length of time that these adverse economic and financial market conditions may persist  or whether such adverse conditions may return in the us and in other countries  is unknown 
during challenging or uncertain economic times  and in tight credit markets  many customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures  which in turn often results in lower demand for our products 
sales to customers outside of the us in   and represented   and of net revenue  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future  and expect that  partially as a result of the acquisitions of scopus and omneon  our international sales may increase 
further  we have a number of international customers to whom sales are denominated in us dollars 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of net revenue in  and  respectively 
the value of the us dollar fluctuates significantly against many foreign currencies  which includes the local currencies of many of our international customers 
if the us dollar appreciates relative to the local currencies of our customers  then the prices of our products correspondingly increase for such customers 
such an effect could adversely impact sales of our products to such customers and result in longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in the affected countries 
further  if the us dollar were to weaken against many major currencies  there can be no assurance that a weaker dollar would lead to growth in capital spending 
in addition  industry consolidation has in the past constrained  and may in the future constrain  capital spending by our customers 
also  if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of customers in the markets on which we focus  our revenue may decline 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been derived from relatively few customers  due in part to the consolidation of the ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite system companies 
however  in the last two years  revenue from our ten largest customers has decreased as a percentage of revenue  due to our growing customer base  in part as a result of the acquisition of scopus and omneon 
sales to our ten largest customers in 
table of contents  and accounted for approximately  and of revenue  respectively 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets and further expanding internationally  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration 
during  and  revenue from comcast accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue 
sales to echostar accounted for of net revenue in the loss of comcast or any other significant customer  any material reduction in orders by comcast or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our new products with a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  we are involved in most quarters in one or more relatively large individual transactions  including  from time to time  projects in which we act much like a systems integrator 
a decrease in the number of the relatively larger individual transactions in which we are involved in any quarter could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  historically  we have been dependent upon capital spending in the cable and satellite industry 
we are attempting to further diversify our customer base beyond cable and satellite customers  including to the telco and broadcast and media markets 
several major telcos have rebuilt or are upgrading their networks to offer bundled video  voice and data services 
in order to be successful in this market  we may need to continue to build alliances with telco equipment manufacturers  adapt our products for telco applications  take orders at prices resulting in lower margins  and build internal expertise to handle the particular contractual and technical demands of the telco industry 
in addition  telco video deployments  including recent trials of mobile video services  are subject to delays in completion  as video processing technologies and video business models are relatively new to most telcos and many of their largest suppliers 
implementation issues with our products or those of other vendors have caused  and may continue to cause  delays in project completion for our customers and delay our recognition of revenue 
we often recognize a substantial portion of our quarterly revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected revenue levels for a specified period  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  even small variations in timing of revenue  particularly from large individual transactions  can cause significant fluctuations in operating results in a particular quarter 
on september   harmonic completed the acquisition of omneon  inc  a private  venture backed company organized under the laws of delaware and headquartered in sunnyvale  california 
the purchase price  net of million of cash acquired  was million  which consisted of i approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  ii million shares of harmonic common stock with a total fair value of approximately million  based on the price of harmonic common stock at the time of close  and iii approximately million  representing the fair value attributed to shares of omneon equity awards which harmonic assumed and for which services had already been rendered as of the close of the acquisition 
the cash portion of the purchase price was paid from existing cash balances 
the company also incurred a total of million of transaction expenses  which were expensed as selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  substantially all unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units issued by omneon and outstanding at closing were assumed by harmonic 
the acquisition of omneon is complementary to harmonic s core business  expanding our customer reach into content providers and extending our product lines into video servers and video optimized storage for content production and playout 
on march   harmonic completed its acquisition of scopus video networks ltd  a publicly traded company organized under the laws of israel 
the purchase price  net of million of cash acquired  was million  which was paid from existing cash balances 
the company also incurred a total of million of transaction expenses  which were expensed as selling  general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of the acquisition of scopus was intended to extend harmonic s worldwide customer base and strengthen its market and technology leadership  particularly in video broadcast in international markets  and the contribution and distribution markets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge  net of estimated sublease income  of million in selling  general and administrative expenses for excess facilities related to the closure of omneon s leased premises in sunnyvale  california 
the employees were moved into harmonic s nearby san jose  california corporate headquarters during the fourth quarter 

table of contents we continue to expand our international operations and staffing to better support our expansion into international markets 
this expansion includes the implementation of an international structure that includes  among other things  an international support center in europe  a research and development cost sharing arrangement  and certain licenses and other contractual arrangements by and among the company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign subsidiaries have acquired certain license rights to use our existing intellectual property and intellectual property that will be developed or licensed in the future  including omneon s existing and future intellectual property 
as a result of these changes and an expanding customer base internationally  we expect that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre tax income will be derived from  and reinvested in  our international operations 
we anticipate that this pre tax income will be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the united states federal statutory tax rate in future periods 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation of inventories  impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from sales of hardware products  software products  solution sales  services and hardware and software maintenance agreements 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements are recognized in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
revenue from hardware product sales is recognized in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on revenue recognition 
subject to other revenue recognition provisions  revenue on hardware product sales is recognized when risk of loss and title has transferred  which is generally upon shipment or delivery  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally 
table of contents recognized on delivery 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific capital equipment projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our equipment to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we do have instances of accepting product returns from distributors and system integrators 
however  such returns typically occur in instances where the system integrator has designed a product into a project for the end user  but the integrator requests permission to return the component as it does not meet the specific project s functional requirements 
such returns are made solely at the discretion of the company  as our agreements with distributors and system integrators do not provide for return rights 
we have extensive experience monitoring product returns from our distributors  and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
with respect to sales to distributors and system integrators  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
when arrangements contain multiple elements  harmonic evaluates all deliverables in the arrangement at the outset of the arrangement based on the applicable accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the undelivered elements qualify as separate units of accounting based on the applicable accounting guidance  which include that the delivered elements have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements  harmonic allocates the arrangement fee based on the relative fair value of the elements of the arrangement 
if a delivered element does not meet the criteria in the applicable accounting guidance to be considered a separate unit of accounting  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
we establish fair value by reference to the price the customer is required to pay when an item is sold separately using contractually stated  substantive renewal rates  when applicable  or the average price of recently completed stand alone sales transactions 
accordingly  the determination as to whether appropriate objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists can impact the timing of revenue recognition for an arrangement 
for multiple element arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  harmonic evaluates the arrangement based on the applicable accounting guidance for non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for as software  and include all non software deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  harmonic accounts for the delivered elements using the residual method 
in arrangements where vsoe of fair value is not available for all undelivered elements  we defer the recognition of all revenue until all elements  except post contract support  have been delivered 
when post contract support is the only undelivered element for such contracts  revenue is then recognized using the residual method 
fair value of software related elements is based on separate sales to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
we also enter into solution sales for the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of products to the specifications of harmonic s customers  including equipment acquired from third parties to be integrated with harmonic s products 
these arrangements typically include the configuration of system interfaces between harmonic product and customer third party equipment  and optimization of the overall solution to operate with the unique features of the customer s design and to meet customer specific performance requirements 
revenue on these arrangements is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on accounting for performance of construction production contracts 
we measure performance under the percentage of completion method using the efforts expended method based on current 
table of contents estimates of labor hours to complete the project 
management believes that  for each such project  labor hours expended in proportion to total estimated hours at completion represents the most reliable and meaningful measure for determining a project s progress toward completion 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred costs of sales 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor hours to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position or cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
revenue from hardware and software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
first year maintenance typically is included in the original arrangement and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
services revenue is recognized on performance of the services and costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
fair value of services such as consulting and training is based upon stand alone sales of these services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
because of the concentrated nature of our customer base  different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract or customer could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the cost of excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on future demand forecasts and historical consumption 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management is of critical importance in order to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
impairment of goodwill or long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and of long lived assets  such as intangibles  whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on the basis of market capitalization adjusted for a control premium and  if necessary  discounted cash flows on the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
for example  changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles  goodwill or long lived assets 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill impairment test in there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
at december   our carrying values for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities harmonic applies applicable accounting guidance which requires that a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities  including an exit or disposal activity  be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred 
harmonic s restructuring activities have primarily been related to excess facilities 
harmonic determines the excess facilities accrual based on expected cash payments  under the applicable facility lease  reduced by any estimated sublease rental income for such facility 
in the event that harmonic is unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  it will need to revise its estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
at december   our accrual for excess facilities totaled million 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in connection with a pending litigation matter  the company recorded a million liability in the fourth quarter of based on management s determination of the company s probable and estimable exposure in the matter 
based on an agreement entered into on january  to settle its then outstanding patent infringement litigation  harmonic believed that a probable and estimable liability had been incurred  and  accordingly  recorded a provision for million in its statement of operations for the year ended december  in other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies for those matters have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results or cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
during the year ended december   a full release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  based on our judgment that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions will be recovered from future taxable income  resulted in a benefit from income taxes of million recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and a million reduction in goodwill 
we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities on a periodic basis 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we apply the provisions of the applicable accounting guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
we have been notified by the internal revenue service that our and us corporate income tax returns have been selected for audit  which is expected to commence in the second quarter of if upon the conclusion of these audits  the ultimate determination of taxes owed in the us is for an 
table of contents amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded in the applicable period  our overall tax expense  effective tax rate and cash flows could be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
any changes in estimate  or settlement of any particular position  could have a material impact on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation harmonic measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and awards related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
stock based compensation expense recognized under applicable accounting guidance on share based payments for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
applicable accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company s determination of fair value of stock options on the date of grant  using an option pricing model  is affected by the company s stock price as well as the assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit grant is based on the underlying value of the company s common stock on the date of grant

additionally  a portion of the increased international net revenue toward the end of can be attributed to the production and playout omneon business  given that a substantial majority of production and playout revenues were international 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future  and expect that  with the completion of the acquisitions of omneon and scopus  our international net revenue may increase 
net revenue in the us decreased in  compared to  primarily due to weaker demand for our products from our domestic satellite and cable operators for vod and hdtv deployments

the higher compensation expense was primarily related to increased headcount  principally due to the additional personnel that we hired as a result of the acquisition of scopus in march  which increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation 
the increased information technology expense was primarily due to the implementation and maintenance of enterprise software systems in the sales and marketing areas 
the increased stock based compensation expense was also primarily due to the acquisition of scopus

table of contents year ended december  in thousands  except percentages provision for benefit from income taxes as a of net revenue increase decrease percent change for the year ended december   our effective tax rate on our pre tax income was  compared to an effective tax rate on our pre tax loss of for the increase is primarily due to the impact of foreign losses for which benefit is not taken and non deductible merger costs 
the difference between the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended december  and the federal statutory rate of is primarily attributable to charges taken due to unbenefitted foreign losses of certain foreign entities  offset by a tax benefit related to an intercompany sale of acquired intangibles  non deductible stock based compensation expense  non deductible merger costs  accrued interest for certain unrecognized tax benefits  and the recording of a valuation allowance against a portion of our california tax credits 
further  new california tax legislation  enacted in february  provides for the election of a single sales apportionment formula beginning in the company anticipates it will elect the single sales apportionment method 
the use of this apportionment method reduces the amount of expected future california taxable income  which required the company to record a valuation allowance against a portion of its california tax credits

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as of december  cash provided by operations was million in  resulting from a net loss of million  adjusted for million in non cash charges  and million for use of cash associated with the net change in assets and liabilities 
the non cash charges included deferred income taxes  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation  depreciation  accretion of investments and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
the net change in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses  as well as decreases in accounts payable and accrued excess facilities cost  which was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue  income taxes payable and accrued and other liabilities 
the increase in accrued and other liabilities was mostly attributable to higher incentive compensation accruals in  as compared to  as a result of the increase in revenue in we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  shipment linearity  accounts receivable collections performance  inventory and supply chain management  tax benefits from stock based compensation  and the timing and 
table of contents amount of compensation and other payments 
we usually pay our annual incentive compensation to employees in the first quarter 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  resulting from the purchase of omneon in september for million and capital expenditures of million  primarily related to leasehold improvements to our new corporate headquarters  partially offset by proceeds from the net sale and maturity of investments of million 
harmonic currently expects capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million during net cash provided by financing activities of million in  primarily due to million in proceeds relating to lessor financing of building improvements for our new corporate headquarters and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in the event we need or desire to access funds from the other short term investments that we hold  it is possible that we may not be able to do so due to adverse market conditions 
our inability to sell all or some of our short term investments at par or our cost  or rating downgrades of issuers of these securities  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  we believe that our existing liquidity sources will satisfy our presently contemplated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if our expectations are incorrect  we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operations  to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
in addition  we actively review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including the global economic slowdown  market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in financial markets and the cable and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

table of contents harmonic indemnifies its officers and the members of its board of directors pursuant to its bylaws and contractual indemnity agreements 
harmonic also indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property matters and other vendors  such as building contractors  pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but  in some instances  includes indemnification for defense costs  damages and other expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as income taxes payable  long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries  and changes in the value of financial instruments held by harmonic 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries  each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
in addition  harmonic has various international branch offices that provide sales support and systems integration services 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of net revenue in both and periodically  harmonic enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to foreign accounts receivable and reduce the effects of fluctuating exchange rates on expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
harmonic does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract to sell euros totaling million and a forward exchange contract to sell japanese yen totaling million 
these forward exchange contracts matured in the first quarter of while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate and credit risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   gross unrealized gains were nominal 
if the credit market deteriorates  we may incur realized losses  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  declining interest rates would negatively impact investment income 
based on our estimates  a basis point  or  change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investments by approximately million as of december
