business overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   both appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
ceva is the world s leading licensor of dsp cores and platform solutions 
our technologies are widely licensed and power some of the world s leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer oem companies 
in  our licensees shipped million ceva powered chipsets targeted for a wide range of diverse end markets  an increase of over shipments of million chipsets 
in  the linley group reported ceva s share of the licensable dsp market at 
given the technological complexity of dsp based applications  there are increased requirements to supplement the dsp core ip and associated dsp software with highly integrated  application specific chips for high volume markets  such as the cellular and data related products and mobile and home multimedia markets 
as a result  we believe there is an industry shift from developing dsp technologies in house to licensing them from third party ip providers  like us  due to the design cycle time constantly shortening and the cost of ownership and maintenance of such architectures 
during the past five years  our business has shown profitability growth and market share expansion as a result of the widespread deployment of our dsp cores with all major handset oems lg electronics  motorola  nokia  samsung  zte  sony ericsson and many others  including a major us based smartphone manufacturer 
this positive trend is evident from our royalty revenues which increased by in from based on internal data and strategy analytics worldwide shipment data  ceva s worldwide market share of cellular baseband chips that incorporate our technologies reached approximately of the worldwide shipment volume based on third quarter worldwide shipments 
this places ceva as the world s dsp architecture deployed in cellular baseband processors  surpassing mediatek  qualcomm and texas instruments 
revenues derived from the handsets market accounted for approximately of both our total annual royalty revenues and total annual revenues for we believe the full scale migration to our dsp cores and technologies in the handsets market has not been fully realized and continues to progress 
also  we are optimistic about adoption of our technologies for new categories of products  collectively referred to as mobile broadband or machine to machine products  and which include g g products  data cards  tablets  netebooks  ereaders  smart meters and more 
the announcements by texas instruments and freescale of their intent to exit the baseband market  after historically having been large players in this market  as well as the emergence of merchant chips from companies such as intel  broadcom and spreadtrum  is a strong positive driver for our future market share expansion 
we believe both the handsets and mobile broadband markets continue to present significant growth opportunities for ceva 
according to commentary from ericsson s management  as of june  there were more than five billion cellular subscriptions worldwide  which is of the entire global population 
strategy analytics forecasts that worldwide cellular baseband shipments will grow by in to reach billion units 
we believe that the majority of the growth coming from feature phones demands in developing countries and the broader adoption of advanced smartphones in mature markets 
we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth in the ultra low cost ulc phone  smartphone and mobile broadband markets as key chip suppliers serving these markets use our technologies broadly 
abi research forecasts that shipments of cellular based devices will nearly double in from  reaching billion units 
the source of this substantial growth is primarily due to new categories of devices that utilize cellular connectivity 
more commonly referred to as mobile broadband connectivity  these devices comprise of various consumer and machine to machine equipments  including embedded g g modems  ereaders  notebooks  tablets  data cards and smart metering equipment 
every cellular connected device requires a dsp based modem for connectivity and many of the leading suppliers of these modems use our dsp technologies 
beyond products enabled by our technologies in handsets and mobile broadband markets  in  there was strong traction in design starts of next generation g lte products utilizing our advanced dsp cores 
fourth generation wireless products require much greater performance and flexibility than g products 
our ceva xc and ceva x dsp cores are currently being designed into g chipsets 
in addition  we recently expanded our ceva xc product line  introducing ceva xc  the second implementation based on the ceva xc architecture  targeting g wireless infrastructure applications  including femto cells  pico cells  micro cells and macro cells 
at the end of  we had customers who licensed our advanced dsps for g applications  this trend underscores our belief that this new product line is well positioned to expand our licensee base in both existing wireless handsets and new wireless infrastructure markets 

table of contents notwithstanding the various growth opportunities we have outlined above  our business operates in a highly competitive environment 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
some of our competitors have reduced their licensing and royalty fees to attract customers and expand their market share 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our existing products  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices which may result in lower profits 
in addition  our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also the successful introduction of new products  which requires the dedication of resources into research and development which in turn may increase our operating expenses 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase during in comparison to  mainly due to increased investments in research and development  including the addition of new engineers  higher salaries and related expenses  lower government grants and to some extent currency exchange expenses as the us dollar is currently devalued against the new israeli shekel nis  the euro and the british pound  which are the primary currencies for our employee salary expenses 
in addition to monitoring and controlling our operating expenses  we must maintain our current level of gross margin in order to offset any future declines in shipment quantities of products based on our technologies or any future declines in any per unit royalty rates 
furthermore  since our products are incorporated into end products of our oem customers  our business is very dependent on our oem customers ability to achieve market acceptance of their end products in the handsets and consumer electronic markets  which are similarly very competitive 
the ever changing nature of the market also affects our continued business growth potential 
for example  the success of our video and audio products are highly dependent on the market adoption of new services and products  such as smartphones  tablets connected devices in the form of dtv  set top boxes and hd video and audio within products such as blu ray dvds  digital tvs  set top boxes 
in addition  our business is affected by market conditions in emerging markets  such as china  india and africa  where the penetration of handsets  especially ultra low cost phones  could generate future growth potential for our business 
the maintenance of our competitive position and our future growth also are dependent on our ability to adapt to ever changing technologies  short product life cycles  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and the trend towards cellular connectivity  and voice  audio and video convergence in the markets that we operate 
moreover  due to the uncertainty about the sustainability of the market recovery  it is extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
therefore  current economic conditions  and specifically the volatility in the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries  could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
as a result  our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  impairment of goodwill  equity based compensation  and accounting for marketable securities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 

table of contents revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions 
management s judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
we generate our revenues from licensing intellectual property  which in certain circumstances is modified to customer specific requirements  royalty income and other revenues  which include revenues from support  training and sale of development systems 
we license our ip to semiconductor companies throughout the world 
these semiconductor companies then manufacture  market and sell custom designed chipsets to oems of a variety of consumer electronics products 
we also license our technology directly to oems  which are considered end users 
we account for our ip license revenues and related services in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and no further obligation exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
a license may be perpetual or time limited in its application 
revenue earned on licensing arrangements involving multiple elements should be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
however  with respect to certain transactions  for multiple element transactions  revenue can be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and vsoe does not exist for one of the delivered elements 
the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the substantive renewal rate as stated in the agreement 
however  we do not believe we have sufficient vsoe of fair value to make such allocations in certain cases in which we undertake services for our customers 
accordingly  in multiple elements agreements which include ip licensing and related services  and the related services are not essential to the functionality of the ip license  the entire arrangement fee is recognized as the services are performed 
extended payment terms in a licensing arrangement may indicate that the license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer unless collection is not considered probable  then revenue is recognized as payments are collected from the customer  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our management characterizes all arrangements that become due after months as extended payments and revenue is recognized as each payment becomes due  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from license fees that involve significant customization of our ip to customer specific specifications are recognized in accordance with the principles set out in fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts recognition  using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method  in accordance with the input method 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total project fees including the license fee and the customization hours charged under the agreement and the percentage of completion achieved 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date on the project compared to the total estimated project requirements  which correspond to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined  in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
as of december   no such losses were identified 
estimated gross profit or loss from long term contracts may change due to changes in estimates resulting from differences between actual performance and original forecasts 
such changes in estimated gross profit are recorded in results of operations when they are reasonably determinable by us  on a cumulative catch up basis 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations  and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
royalties from licensing the right to use our ip are recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
we determine such sales by receiving confirmation of sales subject to royalties from licensees 
non refundable payments on account of future royalties prepaid royalties are recognized upon payment becoming due  provided no future obligation exists 
prepaid royalties are recognized under the licensing revenue line 

table of contents in addition to license fees  contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide support and training  which consists of an identified customer contact and telephone or e mail support 
fees for post contract support  which takes place after delivery to the customer  are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year 
after the mandatory period  the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis 
we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee 
revenue from training is recognized as the training is performed 
revenue from the sale of development systems is recognized when title to the product passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we usually do not provide rights of return 
when rights of return are included in the license agreements  revenue is deferred until rights of return expire 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a detailed review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different from our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary  resulting in additional charges to our statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to  and  as of december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc no 
income taxes fasb asc no 

this statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed 
we provide a valuation allowance  as necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to our estimated realizable value 
accounting for deferred taxes under fasb asc no 
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance is required  we primarily consider such factors as our operating history and any expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
our management currently believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax relating to the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
if we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings during the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determines that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  we will reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
we implements a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb asc no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we do not have a provision for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of our management  will not be distributed to ceva  inc  the us parent company  and will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions involving complex issues  and we have provisions for tax liabilities on investment activities as appropriate 
goodwill we apply fasb asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests under certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
we conduct our annual test of impairment for goodwill on october st of each year 

table of contents in addition  we test to see if impairment exists periodically whenever events or circumstances occur subsequent to our annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
important indicators which we consider in determining whether an impairment is triggered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is performed on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we market our products and services in one segment and allocate goodwill to one reporting unit 
therefore  impairment is tested at the enterprise level using our market capitalization as fair value 
accordingly  in conducting the first step of the impairment test  we compare the carrying value of our assets and liabilities  including goodwill  to our market capitalization 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and we then complete the second step to measure the impairment loss 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  the second step to measure the impairment loss is not required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit among the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized  intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we estimate the future cash flows to determine the fair value of these assets and liabilities 
these cash flows are then discounted at rates reflecting the respective specific industry s cost of capital 
if  upon review  the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount equal to that excess 
should our market capitalization decline  in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or related assumptions change in subsequent periods or actual cash flows are below our estimates  an impairment loss not previously recorded may be required for these assets 
on october   we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test 
because our market capitalization exceeded the carrying value  including goodwill  on the evaluation date  goodwill was not considered impaired 
accounting for equity based compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with fasb asc no 
 stock compensation which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all equity based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors 
we estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods on our consolidated income statement 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of our awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures 
since january   we have used the monte carlo simulation model for options granted 
determining the fair value of equity based awards on the grant date requires the exercise of judgment  including the amount of equity based awards that are expected to be forfeited  which takes into account the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity based compensation expense are reasonable  actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
fasb asc no 
requires the cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the equity based compensation costs recognized for those equity based awards to be classified as financing cash flows 
accounting for marketable securities marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and securities and government and agency securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 investment debt and equity securities  we classify marketable securities as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are stated at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have classified all marketable securities as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because we may sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives 

table of contents we periodically assess whether our investments with unrealized losses are other than temporarily impaired otti 
otti charges exist when we have the intent to sell the security  we will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery  or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that is  a credit loss exists 
otti is determined based on the specific identification method and is reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
we did not recognize otti on our marketable securities in recently issued accounting standards in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events asu no 

the amendment removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
the amendment is effective upon issuance and as such we adopted asu no 
during the first quarter of we have evaluated subsequent events after december  through the date and time the consolidated financial statements were issued 
there were no subsequent events that required disclosure or adjustment to the financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value  as well as disclosures about significant transfers  beginning in the first quarter of additionally  these amended standards require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  beginning in the first quarter of the adoption did not have impact on the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices  consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management s best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
in october  the fasb also issued a new accounting standard  asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements 
specifically  tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above 
both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of this guidance is not expected to have impact on the financial statements

table of contents discussion and analysis below we provide information on the significant line items in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the past three fiscal years  including the percentage changes year on year  as well as an analysis of the principal drivers of change in these line items from year to year 
revenues total revenues total revenues in millions change year on year the increase in total revenues from to principally reflected a combination of significantly higher royalty revenues and slightly higher other revenues  offset by slightly lower licensing revenues 
the decrease in total revenues from to principally reflected a combination of lower licensing and other revenues  offset by higher royalty revenues 
we generate royalty revenue from our customers based on two models royalties paid by our customers during the period in which they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technologies  which we refer to as per unit royalties  and royalties which are paid in a lump sum and in advance to cover a pre defined fixed number of future unit shipments  which we refer to as prepaid royalties 
in either case  these royalties are non refundable payments and are recognized when payment becomes due  provided no future obligation exists 
prepaid royalties are recognized under our licensing revenue line and accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
only royalty revenue from customers who are paying as they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technologies is recognized in our royalty revenue line 
these per unit royalties are invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
in  three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  compared to two customers that accounted for and of our total revenues in and one customer that accounted for of our total revenues in because of the nature of our license agreements and the associated large initial payments due  the identity of major customers generally varies from period to period  and we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one specific customer or any specific small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in this trend is also explained in part due to consolidation in the semiconductor space 
the following table sets forth the products and services that represented or more of our total revenues in each of the periods set forth below year ended december  ceva x family ceva teaklite family ceva teak family we expect these products will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues for the remaining amount consists of other families of products and services that each represented less than of our total revenues 
revenues from baseband chips for handsets that incorporate our technologies accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for  and  respectively

generally  the average royalty per unit from baseband chips incorporating our technologies is lower than the average royalty per unit from other consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenues for included million of catch up royalties on past shipments from two existing customers in the consumer space 
royalty revenues for included million of royalties resulting from catch up royalties on past shipments from another existing customer 
excluding the catch up royalties  the increase in royalty revenues from to is due to i significantly higher shipments of g and g feature phones  ii worldwide market expansion for handsets  and iii our market share gains within our customer base 
excluding the catch up royalties  the increase in royalty revenues from to reflected our market share expansion in the handsets market  as well as new shipments of a portable multimedia device 
the increase was offset by a overall lower shipments of products by our customers in the consumer electronics market due to the global economic downturn  b a decrease in the average royalty rate per unit due to larger volume shipments  which gradually reduced the per unit royalty rate  and c an increase in the volume of feature phone handsets shipped that incorporated our technologies which bears a lower royalty rate 
the five largest customers paying per unit royalty accounted for of our total royalty revenues in  compared to and in and  respectively 
our per unit and prepaid royalty customers reported sales of million chipsets incorporating our technologies in  compared to million in and million in the increase in units shipped in compared to primarily results from the strong momentum in the shipments of cellular processors enabled by our dsps that are now widely deployed across all market segments 
the increase in units shipped in compared to reflected increased unit shipments of handsets both in the low end phone and smartphone segments  offset by decreased shipments of consumer electronic products as a result of the worldwide economic downturns

we have significant operations in israel and the republic of ireland and a substantial portion of our taxable income is generated there 
currently  our israeli and irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
one of our irish operating subsidiaries qualified for a tax rate on its trade until december  starting in january   a tax rate of will apply 
another irish subsidiary qualified for an exemption from income taxes as its sole revenue source is license fees from qualifying patents within the meaning of section of the irish taxes consolidation act this exemption expired on november  and a tax rate now applies 
our israeli operating subsidiary s production facilities have been granted approved enterprise status under israeli law in connection with six separate investment plans 
accordingly  income from an approved enterprise is tax exempt for a period of two or four years and is subject to a reduced corporate tax rate of to based on percentage of foreign ownership for an additional period of six or eight years 
the tax benefit under the first  second  third and fourth plans have expired and are subject to corporate tax of in and in however  the israeli operating subsidiary received in an approval for the erosion of tax basis in respect to its second  third and fourth plans  and as a result no taxable income was attributed to the second and third plans  and a reduced taxable income was attributed to the fourth plan 

table of contents on april   an amendment to the israeli investment law came into effect the amendment and significantly changed the provisions of the investment law 
the amendment included revisions to the criteria for investments qualified to receive tax benefits as an approved enterprise 
the amendment applies to new investment programs and investment programs commencing after  and does not apply to investment programs approved prior to december   and therefore benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted before the amendment came into effect will remain subject to the provisions of the investment law as they were on the date of such approval 
our israeli subsidiary s seventh plan commenced in and eighth plan commenced in are subject to the provisions of the amendment 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with the requirements of the amendment 
however  if we fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to corporate tax in israel at the regular statutory rate of for and in we could also be required to refund tax benefits  with interest and adjustments for inflation based on the israeli consumer price index 
on december   a new economic policy law for was approved  which included an amendment to the investment law the new amendment 
the new amendment allows companies to continue compliance with the investment law prior to enactment of the new amendment until the end of the benefits period for the applicable investment plans in lieu of compliance with the new amendment 
we do not intend to implement the new amendment in the foreseeable future  and intend to continue to comply with the investment law before the enactment of the new amendment 
certain expenditures pursuant to israeli law are permitted to be recognized as a tax deduction over a three year period which has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term bank deposits  million in marketable securities  and million in long term bank deposits  totaling million  compared to million at december  during  we invested million of cash in bank deposits and available for sale marketable securities with maturities up to months

realized gains and losses on sales of investments  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
we periodically assess whether our investments with unrealized losses are other than temporarily impaired otti 
otti charges exist when we have the intent to sell the security  we will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery  or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that is  a credit loss exists 
otti is determined based on the specific identification method and is reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
we did not recognize any otti charges on marketable securities in  and bank deposits are classified as short term bank deposits and long term bank deposits 
short term bank deposits are non tradable deposits with maturities of more than three months but less than one year  whereas long term bank deposits are non tradable deposits with maturities of more than one year

cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments 
our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses 
our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our accounts receivable and interest earned from our cash  deposits and marketable securities 
the timing of receipts of accounts receivable from customers is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts

in  we classified million of excess tax benefit from equity based compensation as financing cash flows 
we believe that our current cash on hand  short term deposits and marketable securities  along with cash from operations  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses

table of contents contractual obligations the table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations leasehold properties operating lease obligations other purchase obligations severance pay total operating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in ireland  israel and the united states 
other operating lease obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools 
purchase obligations consist of capital and operating purchase order commitments 
other than set forth in the table above  we have no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
severance pay relates to accrued severance obligations to our israeli employees as required under israeli labor laws 
these obligations are payable only upon termination  retirement or death of the respective employee 
of this amount  only  is unfunded 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  the majority of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  the nis and the british pound 
increases in volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the us dollar versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when remeasured into us dollars 
we review our monthly expected non us dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations 
this has resulted in a foreign exchange loss of  and million for  and  respectively 
the foreign exchange losses arose principally on the euro and the nis assets and liabilities as a result of the currency fluctuations of the euro and the nis against the dollar 
as a result of currency fluctuations and the remeasurement of non us dollar denominated expenditures to us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and quarterly basis 
to protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flow resulting from salaries paid in currencies other than the us dollar during the year  we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program starting in the second quarter of we hedge portions of the anticipated payroll for our non us employees denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar for a period of one to twelve months with forward and option contracts 
during  and  we recorded accumulated other comprehensive gain of  accumulated other comprehensive loss of  and accumulated other comprehensive gain of  respectively  from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  with respect to anticipated payroll expenses for our non us employees 
as of december   the amount of other comprehensive gain from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  was  which will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during the following months 
we recognized a net gain of million for  a net loss of million for and a net gain of million for  related to forward and options contracts 
we note that hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate and currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis 
the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in high grade certificates of deposits with major us  european and israeli banks 
generally  cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits may be redeemed and therefore minimal credit risk exists with respect to them 
nonetheless  deposits with these banks exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions  to the extent such deposits are even insured in such foreign jurisdictions 
while we monitor on a systematic basis the cash and cash equivalent balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit our funds fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss of principal or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected if the financial institutions that we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail 

table of contents we hold an investment portfolio consisting principally of corporate bonds and securities 
we intend  and have the ability  to hold such investments until recovery of temporary declines in market value or maturity  accordingly  as of december   we believe the losses associated with our investments are temporary and no impairment loss was recognized in however  we can provide no assurance that we will recover present declines in the market value of our investments 
interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities  net  were million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities  net  in both as compared to and as compared to reflected a combination of lower interest rates and higher amortization of premiums of marketable  offset by higher combined cash and marketable securities balances held 
we are exposed primarily to fluctuations in the level of us and emu european monetary union interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates rise  fixed interest investments may be adversely impacted  whereas a decline in interest rates may decrease the anticipated interest income for variable rate investments 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we currently do not have any derivative instruments but may put them in place in the future 
fluctuations in interest rates within our investment portfolio have not had  and we do not currently anticipate such fluctuations will have  a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis
