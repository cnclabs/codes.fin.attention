significant business developments 
net sales grew in  totaling million  compared to million in our extremity product line contributed significantly to our performance in  achieving a growth rate 
additionally  our knee and hip product lines both grew by 
our us extremity business experienced year over year growth from to totaling  primarily due to the continued success of our inbone total ankle system  increased sales of our ortholoc polyaxial trauma plating system  launched in late  and increased sales of our valor ankle fusion nail system  which had a full commercial launch in june of our international sales increased by during as compared to this increase was driven by continued growth in our asian markets and the substantial majority of our european markets  as well as our increased presence in australia  partially offset by lower sales to our stocking distributor in turkey 
additionally  our sales included a million favorable currency impact as compared to our net income increased to million in  from million in the substantial majority of this increase is driven by changes in certain expenses that are not part of our on going operations  including the million provision for potential losses associated with a trade receivable recorded in and the million write off of cumulative translation adjustment cta balances for certain subsidiaries that were substantially liquidated in  as well as lower levels of restructuring expenses 
additionally  during our net income increased due to profits associated with higher levels of sales  as well as lower levels of amortization expense 
in january  we announced the extension of our supply agreement with lifecell corporation  a business unit of kinetic concepts  inc kci for the supply of graftjacket regenerative tissue matrix through december for orthopaedic markets 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with kci to license our graftjacket brand to kci for exclusive use in wound markets 
consideration to be paid by kci consists primarily of million payable over the next twelve months  as well as payments based on future sales of licensed products 
the license agreement is expected to have a negative impact on our global sales growth rate of approximately to in and our us biologics sales growth rate of to 
however  we do not expect it to have an impact on our earnings results 
in february  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement 
at the same time  we announced that we had commenced a tender offer for any and all of our outstanding convertible senior notes due notes 
we expect to fund the purchase of notes tendered in the tender offer and pay the related fees and expenses from borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement and our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
until the expiration of the tender offer  we are unable to estimate the amount we will draw on the credit agreement  nor the amount of the notes that will remain outstanding upon completion of the tender offer 
in the event that all of the notes are validly tendered in the tender offer and not validly withdrawn  we expect to draw approximately million on the credit agreement to fund the purchase of the notes 

table of contents opportunities and challenges 
our results of operations can be substantially affected not only by global economic conditions  but also by local operating and economic conditions  which can vary substantially by market 
unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may result in actions that adversely affect our margins  constrain our operating flexibility  or result in charges which are unusual or non recurring 
the current state of the global economy has negatively impacted industry growth rates in both us and international markets  and we are unable to predict when these markets will return to historical rates of growth 
in our us markets  we expect that an expansion of our sales force and product offerings will favorably impact our extremities and biologics businesses in however  we continue to expect that our us hip and knee business will continue to be unfavorably impacted by the economic downturn 
significant industry factors 
our industry is affected by numerous competitive  regulatory  and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the united states food and drug administration fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and has recently experienced increased pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joint devices 
in december  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj through the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao requesting documents for the period january through the present related to any consulting and professional service agreements with orthopaedic surgeons in connection with hip or knee joint replacement procedures or products 
this subpoena was served shortly after several of our knee and hip competitors agreed to resolutions with the doj after being subjects of investigations involving the same subject matter 
on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  wright medical technology  inc wmt entered into a month deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the usao and a civil settlement agreement csa with the united states 
under the dpa  the usao agrees not to prosecute wmt in connection with the matter if wmt satisfies its obligations during the month term of the dpa 
pursuant to the csa  wmt settled civil and administrative claims relating to the matter for a payment of million without any admission by wmt 
in conjunction with the csa  wmt also entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health and human services 
pursuant to the dpa  an independent monitor will review and evaluate wmt s compliance with its obligations under the dpa 
together  these agreements resolve the investigation commenced by the usao in december the usao specifically acknowledges in the dpa that it does not allege that wmt s conduct adversely affected patient health or patient care 
the dpa and cia impose certain obligations on wmt to maintain compliance with us healthcare regulatory laws 
our failure to do so could expose us to significant liability including  but not limited to  extension of the term of the dpa by up to six months  exclusion from federal healthcare program participation  including medicaid and medicare  civil and criminal fines or penalties  and additional litigation cost and expense 
in march  comprehensive health care reform legislation in the form of the patient protection and affordable health care act and the health care and education reconciliation act was enacted 
among other initiatives  these bills impose a excise tax on us sales of medical devices after december  
table of contents a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in risk factors 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended december  change hip products knee products extremity products biologics products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart net sales 
our us net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in  of total net sales in and a increase in over our international net sales totaled million in  an increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  due to the favorable performance of the japanese yen and the canadian dollar against the us dollar  which was partially offset by the unfavorable performance of the euro against the us dollar 
the favorable currency impact  the growth of our sales in australia  and an increase in international sales due to continued growth in our asian markets  were partially offset by a reduction in sales to our stocking distributor in turkey 
our net sales growth in was led by our extremities product line  which increased over  while our knee and hip businesses increased and  respectively  and our biologic business was relatively flat 
our hip product net sales totaled million in  representing a increase over this increase was driven by increased international sales of our profemur hip system  primarily within japan and europe  as well as a million favorable currency impact compared to in  us hip sales declined compared to  due to declines in both unit sales and pricing 
net sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of over in the us  knee sales increased over due to increased unit sales  which were partially offset by declines in pricing 
internationally  knee sales increased in over our extremity product net sales increased to million in  representing growth of over this increase was primarily driven by our us extremity business  which increased  primarily resulting from the continued success of our inbone total ankle system  increased sales of our ortholoc polyaxial trauma plating system  launched in late  and increased sales of our valor ankle fusion nail system  which had a limited launch in and a full commercial launch in june of international extremity sales growth of was primarily driven by our australian subsidiary 
net sales of our biologic products totaled million in  which was relatively flat as compared to our us biologics sales were flat compared to  as increased sales of our pro stim osteoinductive bone graft substitute  which had a limited launch in late and a full commercial launch in 
table of contents october  were offset by continued declines of our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes and our allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes 
our international net sales of biologics grew over prior year  due to increased sales by our australian subsidiary  which were offset by decreased sales to our stocking distributor in turkey 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in both and unfavorable geographic mix shifts  as our more profitable us sales decreased as a percentage of total sales  along with unfavorable pricing in our us hip and knee business were offset by lower levels of excess and obsolete inventory provisions and favorable manufacturing variances 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses  levels of production volume and currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled and in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense for included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales and million of costs associated with our us government inquiries and our dpa of net sales 
during  selling  general and administrative expense included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales  million of costs  primarily legal fees  associated with us government inquiries of net sales  and a million provision for potential losses associated with a trade receivable of net sales 
the remaining expenses declined by points as a percentage of net sales primarily as a result of leveraging of expenses in europe  which were partially offset by investments in our foot and ankle sales force and higher levels of cash incentive compensation 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales and requires us to expand our infrastructure 
further  in the near term  we anticipate that these expenses may increase as a percentage of net sales as we make strategic investments to grow our business  as we incur expenses associated with our compliance with the dpa  and as our spending related to the global compliance requirements of our industry increases 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
our research and development expense included non cash  stock based compensation expense of million of net sales in  compared to million of net sales in the remaining expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of net sales as spending grew at the same rates as sales 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will remain relatively flat as a percentage of net sales  but will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives and clinical studies to support regulatory approvals and provide expanded proof of the efficacy of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
charges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  as compared to million in the decrease is due to a significant portion of our intangible assets that became fully amortized at the end of based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in interest expense income  net 
interest expense income  net  consists of interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  primarily from our million of convertible senior notes due issued in november this was partially offset by interest income of  and million during and  respectively  generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the decline in interest income is due to the overall decline in interest rates on our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities during 
table of contents the amounts of interest income we realize in and beyond are subject to variability  dependent upon both the rate of invested returns we realize and the amount of excess cash balances on hand 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net  totaled  of expense during compared to million of expense during during  we recognized million of expense related to the write off of the cta balances for certain subsidiaries that have been substantially liquidated 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for and was and respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance in both years  higher levels of non deductible expenses in  primarily due to a portion of the civil settlement payment that is considered not deductible  and the greater impact of certain deductions on our lower income in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  amount of sales amount of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income interest expense income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income

our us net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in each year and a increase over our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  principally resulting from the performance of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar 
the unfavorable currency impact  declines in france  and a reduction in sales to our stocking distributor in turkey were offset by an increase in international sales due to continued growth in our asian markets  primarily within our hip product lines  as well as certain of our european markets 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in our extremity  hip and knee product lines while we experienced declines in our biologics product line 
for  we experienced growth of  and  in our extremity  hip  and knee product lines  respectively  while our biologics  product line declined 
during  our extremity sales growth was attributable primarily to the continued success of our charlotte foot and ankle system and our darco plating systems  as well as sales related to our inbone and rayhack products  which were acquired in april and september  respectively 
the increase in our hip product sales was driven by increased sales of our profemur hip system  and our dynasty acetabular cup system  which was launched during the second quarter sales of our knee products increased in compared to the prior year as a result of growth in our advance knee systems  which was partially offset by declines across our other  more mature knee product 
table of contents offerings 
the decline in our biologics business in was primarily attributable to lower levels of sales of our allomatrix product line  which was partially offset by increased sales of our pro dense injectable regenerative graft and our graftjacket tissue repair products 
cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in this increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of excess and obsolete inventory provisions  increased raw material and other manufacturing costs  and unfavorable currency exchange rates 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses decreased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in from operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges 
the decrease in operating expenses was attributed primarily to decreased restructuring expenses  as well as lower levels of expenses due to cost saving initiatives primarily in our european subsidiaries  lower levels of cash incentive compensation and the charge for in process research and development  all of which were partially offset by costs associated with increased expenses associated with global compliance efforts 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense income  net  consisted of interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  primarily from our million of convertible senior notes due issued in november  our capital lease agreements  and  in  certain of our factoring agreements 
this was partially offset by interest income of million and million during and  respectively  generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the decline in interest income is due to the overall decline in interest rates on our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities during other expense income  net 
other expense income  net  totaled million of expense during compared to million of income during during  we recognized million of expense related to the write off of the cta balances for certain subsidiaries that had been substantially liquidated 
during  we recognized  of deferred gain associated with the disposition of our adcon gel assets 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
in  we reduced our valuation allowance as a result of a change in estimate regarding the jurisdiction where certain deductions would be recognized for tax purposes  which decreased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
our effective tax rate includes a tax provision of million to adjust our valuation allowance  primarily to record a valuation allowance against all of our remaining deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in france  which increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our reconstructive products are used in elective procedures  which generally decline during the summer months  typically resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos and the american college of foot and ankle surgeons acfas 
the aaos meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this three day event  we display our most recent and innovative products for these surgeons 
the acfas meeting  similar to aaos  is another three day event to display our latest innovations in the foot and ankle market 

table of contents restructuring toulon  france in  we announced our plans to close our facilities in toulon  france 
this announcement came after a thorough evaluation in which we determined that we had excess manufacturing capacity and redundant distribution and administrative resources that would be best eliminated through the closure of this facility 
the majority of our restructuring activities were complete by the end of  with production now conducted solely in our existing manufacturing facility in arlington  tennessee and the distribution activities being carried out from our european headquarters in amsterdam  the netherlands 
we estimated that total pre tax restructuring charges would be approximately million to million 
we have recognized million through december   and have completed our restructuring activities in toulon  france 
we began realizing the benefits from this restructuring within selling  general and administrative expenses in while we began realizing the benefits from this restructuring within cost of sales in  unfavorable currency exchange rates and increased raw material and other manufacturing costs have offset some of those benefits

operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled and million in and  respectively  as compared to cash used by operating activities of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in our provision for deferred taxes  which was mostly offset by changes in working capital  primarily due to the decrease in our inventory balance in in compared to  the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in working capital  as inventory balances decreased significantly due to a focus on inventory management during  and accounts receivable decreased as the result of diligent collection efforts  which were partially

the decrease in compared to is attributable to lower levels of expenditures related to the expansion of our arlington  tennessee facilities  as well as lower levels of investments in surgical instrumentation related to acquired and new products 
our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted principally of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures in of approximately million for routine capital expenditures 
financing activities 
during  cash used in financing activities totaled  compared to cash provided by financing activities in of  this decrease is primarily the result of the payment of financing charges associated with the renewal of our revolving credit facility in june in early  we terminated certain accounts receivable factoring agreements

the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements  which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their 
table of contents respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments under non cancelable contracts with consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
contingent consideration of up to  may be paid related to the acquisition of certain assets associated with the ez concept surgical device corporation ez frame 
the potential additional cash payments are based on the future financial performance of the acquired assets 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our us sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales 
a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to royalties earned based on product sales 
additionally  as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on us and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 
certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds totaling million 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balances totaling million and available borrowings under the new credit agreement will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  meet our contractual cash obligations in  and purchase any of our convertible senior notes tendered in the tender offer 
critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of 
table of contents existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and surgery centers and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of employee and independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals and surgery centers when they take title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately  and  of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience credit losses on our accounts receivable and accordingly  we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  we have experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international stocking distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continued collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically appropriate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately not collected 
while we believe that our 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly  which would necessitate additional allowances in future periods 
our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  at december  and  respectively  which includes a million provision recorded in and a million provision recorded in for potential losses related to the trade receivable balances of certain of our non us stocking distributors 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out fifo basis or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc section  property  plant and equipment fasb asc 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation and amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  if we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on the asset s fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional 
table of contents information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities  and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss can be developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance balances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carryforward of certain tax basis net operating losses and general business tax credits 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january   which requires the tax effects of an income tax position to be recognized only if they are more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  income taxes 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions  and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we calculate the grant date fair value of non vested shares as the closing sales price on the trading day immediately prior to the grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of these stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 

table of contents we estimate the expected life of options evaluating the historical activity as required by fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  such stock based compensation expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
a change in assumptions may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our stock based compensation disclosures 
acquisition method accounting 
prior to january   we accounted for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows associated with the asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with standard valuation methods 
the estimates of future cash flows include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for acquired businesses 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  business combinations fasb asc 
under this standard  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value 
legal fees and other transaction related costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
fasb asc also requires  among other things  acquirers to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition 
restructuring charges 
we evaluate impairment issues for long lived assets under the provisions of fasb asc we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc section  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time termination benefit arrangements and other costs associated with exit activities are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc section  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we estimated the expense for our restructuring initiatives by accumulating detailed estimates of costs  including the estimated costs of employee severance and related termination benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases and any other qualifying exit costs 
such costs represented management s best estimates  which were evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment was required 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the interest rates associated with our invested cash balances 
on december   we have invested short term cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
based on this level of investment  a decrease of in interest rates would have a negative annual impact of  to our interest income 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure 
for sales not denominated in us dollars  an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and our competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries  which are denominated in the euro  from japan  which are denominated in the japanese yen  from the united kingdom  which are denominated in the british pound  and from canada  which are denominated in the canadian dollar 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  the yen  the british pound  and the canadian dollar 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the yen  the us dollar and the british pound  and the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
