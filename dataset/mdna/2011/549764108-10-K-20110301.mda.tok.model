item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general lufkin industries is a global supplier of oil field and power transmission products 
through its oil field segment  the company manufactures and services artificial lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for industrial applications 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s strategy is to differentiate its products through additional value added capabilities 
examples of these capabilities are high quality engineering  customized designs  rapid manufacturing response to demand through plant capacity  inventory and vertical integration  superior quality and customer service  and an international network of service locations 
in addition  the company s strategy is to maintain a low debt to equity ratio in order to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities and pay dividends even during unfavorable business cycles 
in support of its strategy  the company has made capital investments in the oil field segment to increase manufacturing capacity and capabilities in its two main manufacturing facilities in lufkin  texas and argentina 
these investments have reduced production lead times  improved quality and reduced manufacturing costs 
investments also continue to be made to expand the company s presence in automation products and international service 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased international lift systems ils  which manufactures and services gas lift  plunger lift and completion equipment for the oil and gas industry and in november acquired the assets of petro hydraulic lift systems  which manufactured hydraulic pumping units 
in july  the company announced its intention to construct a new multi purpose manufacturing an d aftermarket facility in ploiesti romania to support market expansion efforts in the eastern hemisphere 
this facility will manufacture products for both the oil field and power transmission segments  with an initial focus on oil field products 
this facility  which is being built on an acre site  will have an estimated aggregate gross cost of million 
when completed in  the facility will initially employ just over employees 
the government of romania  through the ministry of public finance  has agreed to provide the company with economic development incentives and financial assistance of million euros towards the construction costs  which accounts for approximately of the total cost of the plant 
the company continues to look for investment opportunities to reduce manufacturing costs  expand geographically and add product offerings in the artificial lift space 
on november  the company completed the acquisition of the significant operating assets of petr o hydraulic lift systems  llc phl and certain related companies  based in south louisiana 
phl  specializes in the design  manufacture and leasing of hydraulic rod pumping units for oil and gas wells 
in the power transmission segment  the company continues to expand its gear repair network by opening and expanding facilities in various locations in the united states and canada 
the company has made targeted capital investments in the united states and france to expand capacity  develop new product lines and reduce manufacturing lead times  in addition to certain capital investments targeting cost reductions 
on july   the company purchased rotating machinery technology  inc rmt  which specializes in the analysis  design and manufacture of precision  custom engineered tilting pad bearings and related components for high speed turbo equipment operating in critical duty applications 
rmt also services  repairs and upgrades turbo expander process units for air and gas separation  both on site with its skilled field service team and at its repair facility in wellsville  new york 
the company intends to focus future capital investments for oil field and power transmission on international geographic expansion of manufacturing and service centers 
trends outlook oil field demand for the company s artificial lift equipment is primarily dependent on the level of new onshore oil wells  workover drilling activity  the depth and fluid conditions of such drilling activity and general field maintenance budgets 
drilling activity is driven by the available cash flow of the company s customers as well as their long term perceptions of the level and stability of the price of oil 
increasing energy prices since increased the demand for pumping units and related service and products as a result of higher drilling activity  activation of idle wells and the upgrading of existing wells 
in the fourth quarter of  energy prices dramatically declined due to reductions in global demand 
planned new drilling and workover activity also reduced significantly as capital and operating budgets were reduced 
these negative trends continue d into the first quarter of  and worsened during the second quarter of  as e p companies deferred or cancelled drilling programs and reduced field spending in response to lower energy prices 
this trend was more pronounced in north america than in international markets 
lower selling prices combined with the negative impact of low capacity utilization in manufacturing facilities caused gross margins to decline in in the second half of  oil prices increased back to levels and drilling activity  especially for oil  increased 
during  demand from north america increased steadily as the oil directed rig count level surpassed levels 
north america demand for artificial lift equipment has not increased as quickly as the oil directed rig count due to fewer well completions per rig drilling due to the increased use of multi stage horizontal frac technology  delays in completions due to unavailability of frac crews and improvements in drilling technology that extends the length of time wells remain free flowing 
also  while order levels have continued to increase during  the ability to raise prices remains a challenge 
most raw material prices have remained stable during  but certain raw material associated with cast iron have recently increased 
the company expects demand to continue to increase over levels as these market issues are resolved and equipment sales st art to catch up to the prior oil directed rig count increases 
while the oil market is cyclical  the company continues to believe that there are long term positive growth trends for artificial lift equipment  and as existing fields mature  the market will require an increased use of artificial lift  especially in the south american  european  russian and middle eastern markets 
for this reason  the company announced its intentions to construct a new multi purpose manufacturing and aftermarket facility in romania to support these markets 
the new facility will be operational in and will cost approximately million net after romanian government economic incentives 
additionally  the acquisitions of ils and phl were consistent with the company s long term growth strategy of integrating strategic assets to leverage the company s position of industry leadership  providing an entry for lufkin into the offshore mark et for artificial lift wells  including deepwater plays  and expanded reach into the artificial lift market 
power transmission power transmission services many diverse markets  with high speed gearing for markets such as petrochemicals  refineries  offshore production and transmission of oil and slow speed gearing for the gas  rubber  sugar  paper  steel  plastics  mining  cement and marine propulsion markets  each of which has its own unique set of drivers 
generally  if global industrial capacity utilizations are not high  spending on new equipment lags 
also impacting demand are government regulations involving safety and environmental issues that can require capital spending 
recent market demand increases have come from energy related markets such as refining  petrochemical  drilling  coal  marine and power generation in response to higher global energy prices 
during the latter part of  energy prices decreased significantly  global growth slowed and large project financing became difficult to secure 
new order booking declined in the first half of  which negatively impacted sales starting in late while sales remained at these lower levels throughout the first half of  new order and quotation activity  especially from the energy markets  increased during over levels seen in the pace of bookings in is expected to remain at this higher level  which should translate in to overall higher sales in compared to discontinued operations during the second quarter of  the trailer segment was classified as a discontinued operation 
in january  the company announced the decision to suspend its participation in the commercial trailer markets and to develop a plan to run out existing inventories  fulfill contractual obligations and close all trailer facilities 
during the second quarter of  this plan was completed  with the majority of the remaining inventory and manufacturing equipment sold and all facilities closed 
other during  and  the company booked pre tax contingent liability provisions of million  million and million  respectively  for its ongoing class action lawsuit

liquidity and capital resources the company has historically relied on cash flows from operations and third party borrowings to finance its operations  including acquisitions  dividend payments and stock repurchases 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and its available borrowing capacity under its credit agreements will be sufficient to fund its operations  including planned capital expenditures  dividend payments and stock repurchases  through december   and the foreseeable future 
the company s cash balance totaled million at december   compared to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities totaled million and net cash used in financing activities amounted to million 
significant components of cash provided by operating activities included net earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash expenses  of million  partially offset by an increase in working capital of million 
this working capital increase was primarily due to an increase in trade receivables and inventory balances of million and million  respectively  due to increased sales volumes during  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities included net capital expenditures totaling million and the ils  rmt  and phl acquisitions totaling million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for new facilities to support geographical and product line expansions in the oil field and power transmission segments 
capital expenditures for are projected to increase over spending levels  primarily for the new romanian manufacturing facility  other new manufacturing and service facilities to support geographical and product line expansions and equipment replacement for efficiency improvements in the oil field and power transmission segments and will be funded by operating cash flows 
significant components of net cash used by financing activities included dividend payments of million  or  per share and debt repayments of million 
proceeds from stock option exercises of million partially offset financing cash outflows 
the company has a three year credit facility with a domestic bank the bank facility consisting of an unsecured revolving line of credit that provides up to million of aggregate borrowing 
this bank facility expires on december  borrowings under the bank facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the greater of i the prime rate  ii the base cd rate plus an applicable margin or iii the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin or the london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin  depending on certain ratios as defined in the bank facility 
as of december   no debt was outstanding under the bank facility and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the terms of the bank facility 
deducting outstanding letters of credit of million  million of borrowing capacity was available at december the following table summarizes the company s expected cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments as of december  information on recurring purchases of materials for use in manufacturing and service operations has not been included 
these amounts are not long term in nature less than six months and are generally consistent from year to year 
in thousands of dollars payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures total since the company has no significant tax loss carryforwards  the company expects to make quarterly estimated tax payments in based on taxable income levels 
also  the company has various qualified retirement plans for which the company has committed a certain level of benefit 
the company expects to make contributions to its pension plans of million and to its post retirement health and life plans of approximately million in contribution levels to these plans after will depend on participation in the plans  possible plan changes  discount rates and actual rates of return on plan assets 
as discussed in note business segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements  set forth in part ii  item of this form k  the consolidated balance sheet at december  includes approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  lufkin cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which changes the accounting for certain revenue arrangements 
the new requirements change the allocation methods used in determining how to account for multiple payment streams and will result in the ability to separately account for more deliverables  and potentially less revenue deferrals 
additionally  asu requires enhanced disclosures in financial statements 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  on a prospective basis  with early application permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact asu will have on our financial statements 
management believes the impact of other recently issued guidance  which is not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments an d estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in some cases  a customer is not able to take delivery of a completed product and requests that the company store the product for a defined period of time 
the company will process a bill and hold invoice and recognize revenue at the time of the storage request if all of the following criteria are met l the customer has accepted title and risk of loss  l the customer has provided a written purchase order for the product  l the customer  not the company  requested the product to be stored and to be invoiced under a bill and hold arrangement 
the customer must also provide the business purpose for the storage request  l the customer must provide a storage period and future shipping date  l the company must not have retained any future performance obligations on the product  l the company must segregate the stored product and not make it available to use on other orders  and l the product must be completed and ready for shipment 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
generally  annual increases in the inflation rate or the first in  first out fifo value of inventory cause the value of the lifo reserve to increase 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  such as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company s fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows  which requires management to make judgments about future operating results  working capital requirements and capital spending levels 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in a determin ation that goodwill is impaired and a corresponding impairment charge 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
the company is required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax laws  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires the company to make many assumptions and judgments regarding merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not the company is required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that it is more likely than not some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility may not occur  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers defined benefit plans and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
assuming all other variables held constant  differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following estimated imp act on results pension other thousands of dollars benefits benefits discount rate effect of change on net periodic benefit cost income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
while the company s accounts receivable are concentrated with customers in the energy industry the company performs credit evaluations on current and potential customers and adjusts credit limits as appropriate 
in certain circumstances the company will obtain collateral to mitigate higher credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
due to the lack of current debt  the company does not have any significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  if the company drew on its line of credit under its bank facility  the company would have exposure since the interest rate is variable 
in addition  the company primarily invoices and purchases in the same currency as the functional currency of its operations  which minimizes exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
the company uses large amounts of steel  iron and electricity in the manufacture of its products 
the prices of these raw materials have a significant impact on the cost of producing products 
steel and electricity prices have increased significantly in the last five years  caused primarily by higher energy prices and increased global demand 
since the company does not enter into long term contracts with most of its suppliers  the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of cast iron and steel 
raw material prices may increase significantly in the future 
certain items such as steel round  bearings and aluminum have continued to experience price increases  price volatility and longer lead times 
if the company is unable to pass future raw material price increases on to its customers  margins  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company is exposed to currency fluctuations with intercompany debt denominated in us dollars owed by its french and canadian subsidiaries 
as of december   this inter company debt was comprised of a million receivable and a million payable from france and canada  respectively 
as of december   if the us dollar strengthened by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of expense and if the us dollar weakened by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of income 
also  certain assets and liabilities  primarily employee and tax related in argentina  denominated in the local currency of foreign operations whose functional currency is the us dollar are exposed to fluctuations in currency rates 
as of december   if the us dollar strengthened or weakened by over th ese currencies  the net income and expense impact would be negligible
