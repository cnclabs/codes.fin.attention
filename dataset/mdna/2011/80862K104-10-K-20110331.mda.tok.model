overview sciclone pharmaceuticals nasdaq scln is a revenue generating  china centric  specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial international business and a product portfolio of novel therapies for cancer and infectious diseases 
we are focused on continuing international sales growth  while containing clinical development and other costs 
our international business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the people s republic of china china where we believe we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through our many years of experience marketing zadaxin 
we believe these strengths position us to benefit from expanding pharmaceutical markets in china and elsewhere 
we believe china will rank second among global pharmaceutical markets by  with projected annual growth rates of more than annually over the next several years 
we seek to grow our sales in the region while we leverage our strong balance sheet for mergers and acquisitions m a  in licensing and product acquisitions 
zadaxin  our brand of thymalfasin or thymosin alpha  has regulatory approval in over countries for the treatment of hbv  as a vaccine adjuvant  for the treatment of hcv  and certain cancers 
all of our revenues are derived from sales of zadaxin  substantially most of which is sold to china 
to continue to grow zadaxin sales to china  our sales force of over people is focused on increasing sales to the country s largest hospitals class with over beds as well as smaller hospitals class 
these hospitals serve tier and tier cities which are the largest  and generally have the most affluent populations 
in china  they are mainly located in the eastern portion of the nation 
as our approval in china is an imported drug license  all sales are made to licensed importers 
most of our sales are made to two such importers and in recent months  sinopharm group co 
limited acquired a majority interest in these two large importers 
to date  we have been able to maintain our gross margin in part due to relatively stable or even decreasing costs of sales  and in part due to maintaining a relatively stable sales price 
we anticipate that gross margins will remain in the historical range  however prices in china are subject to regulation  and are currently under review by regulatory authorities  and if a substantial reduction in the sale price to hospitals occurred  our gross margins would be substantially reduced 
we believe our current cash and investment position and the gross profit from our product sales provide the financial resources to execute on our strategy for continued growth in our international business and for development of our pipeline of late stage product candidates 
we continue to look for m a or in licensing opportunities of late stage or approved branded  well differentiated products that are approved or have a clear regulatory pathway 
to date  we have in licensed two products that are part of this international commercial growth strategy  dc bead and ondansetron rapidfilm 
we are working towards regulatory approval in china for these in licensed candidates 
dc bead  an in licensed product for which we have commercialization rights in china  is a novel treatment for advanced liver cancer and is currently approved in approximately countries worldwide  including countries in the european union eu and the us we commenced a small local registration trial in which has completed enrollment of approximately advanced liver cancer patients at several liver cancer treatment centers 
the primary objective is safety and the secondary objective is efficacy  as measured by tumor response 
we believe we may receive regulatory approval for dc bead in late 
table of contents our second in licensed product as part of this international commercial growth strategy is ondansetron rapidfilm 
this product is an oral thin film formulation of ondansetron  a serotonin ht receptor antagonist commonly used to treat and prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy  radiotherapy and surgery 
in march  we announced that approval was granted for ondansetron rapidfilm tm under the eu decentralized procedure in major eu countries 
we have commercialization rights for this product in china including hong kong and macau  and vietnam  and we are working towards filing a clinical trial application in as part of the product registration process which will begin the regulatory approval process in china 
outside of china  sciclone s clinical development strategy is focused on driving cost efficient phase and development of promising compounds while seeking development partners for more costly phase trials 
we are currently developing scv  a small molecule synthetic peptide with immunomodulating properties  in a phase b clinical trial for the prevention of oral mucositis om 
om is a common  painful  debilitating complication of cancer treatment  and we estimate that medical costs for the treatment of oral mucositis were approximately billion in the us and billion worldwide in approximately  patients per year in the us suffer from om during cancer therapy 
in may  we announced top line results from our phase a proof of concept clinical trial of scv to modify the course of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy regimens 
based on the findings from the phase a study and discussions with the us food and drug administration  we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the company s phase b clinical trial of scv for the prevention of om in january of the b study is examining three doses of scv  including two higher doses than those used in the company s recent phase a study  to assess the drug s impact on modifying the course of om in patients with head and neck cancer 
in addition  the trial is further evaluating scv s safety and tolerability in this patient population  as well as the role played by specific genetic profiles on patient response to the treatment 
the multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study is designed to enroll approximately patients who are receiving standard chemoradiation therapy for treatment of cancers of the head and neck 
patients are being randomly assigned to one of the trial s four treatment arms scv at doses of mg kg  mg kg or mg kg  or placebo 
the study s primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in proportion of patients with clinically assessed ulcerative om who grade at the time that they have received a cumulative radiation dose of gy 
the study s secondary endpoints include  incidence and duration of ulcerative and severe who grade om  analgesic use and pain assessments  quality of life measurements  gastrostomy tube placement and use  breaks in radiation or chemotherapy treatment  and unscheduled office or hospital visits 
the united states securities and exchange commission sec and the united states department of justice doj are each conducting formal investigations of us regarding a range of matters including the possibility of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
in response to these matters  our board of directors has appointed a special committee of independent directors to oversee the company s response to the government inquiries 
based on an initial review  the special committee has decided to undertake an independent investigation as to matters reflected in and arising from the sec and doj investigations including  but not limited to  certain sales and marketing matters in china  in order to evaluate whether any violation of the fcpa or other laws occurred 
the special committee has not concluded its investigation or reached any conclusions  to date  nor has the special committee or management made a final determination regarding whether any violation of the fcpa or any other law or regulation has occurred 
however  we anticipate that the special committee will finalize its findings in the near future  which may include findings regarding potential fcpa issues and recommendations regarding additional remediation measures and possible suggestions regarding personnel issues 
in the course of its review  the special committee has instructed management to i evaluate and to expand the company s training of employees regarding understanding and compliance with laws including the fcpa and other anti bribery laws and regulations  ii evaluate our existing compliance and anti bribery guidelines and to prepare a new  more detailed  guideline for implementation after review by our board and or committees of the board  and iii implement a pre approval policy for certain expenses including payments for  or reimbursement of  third party gifts  travel expenses  honoraria and sponsorships of certain third party events 

table of contents we have consistently maintained a policy that our employees comply with all applicable laws 
however  in the course of evaluating our existing training  policies and internal controls over financial reporting and expense approval and expense reimbursement practices  and of the matters brought to the attention of management by the special committee  we determined that our guidelines  employee training and expense approval practices and our internal controls with respect to certain matters  including the payment for  or reimbursement of  third party gifts  travel expenses  honoraria and sponsorship of certain third party events required improvements in order to provide reasonable assurance that our policy on compliance with applicable laws was effective 
in addition  management determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  relating to our implementation of our policy on compliance with laws 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated or commenced various remediation efforts to provide reasonable assurance of our implementation of our policy on compliance with laws  including the fcpa and other anti bribery laws 
see management s annual report on  and changes in  internal control over financial reporting for further information regarding this material weakness and our remediation efforts 
since our special committee has not reached any conclusions and has not reported its findings to the board  none of the disclosures in this form k are intended to  or do  represent the special committee s finding or conclusions 
we anticipate that the special committee will conclude its investigation soon 
we anticipate that the special committee may make more specific or different findings in addition to the disclosures herein 
we also anticipate that the special committee may recommend additional remediation measures to those we have already taken or commenced 
following our announcement of the sec and doj investigations  various shareholder litigations were filed and further litigation may be filed 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters  but we have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses in the course of the investigations  and in connection with current or future litigation 
if it is determined that sales or marketing activities have occurred that violate  or may have violated  the fcpa or other laws  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  we could incur additional expenses related to fines  or to remediative measures including changes in our compliance programs  internal controls or disclosure controls 
we believe our cash and investments as of december  and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report quarterly losses in the future 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of delivery 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part  except for sales to a new market where acceptance requirements have to be met 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them 
importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
we estimate expected returns primarily on historical patterns 
historically  we have had no product returns of damaged  defective or expired product 
as such  no amount was accrued for product returns as of december  and in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where collectability is uncertain and revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
cash equivalents and investments we record investments at fair value  as determined by available information on the consolidated balance sheet date 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value of financial instruments we record our financial assets including cash equivalents and accrued liabilities at cost  which approximates fair value due to their short term nature 
investments in marketable securities are recorded at their estimated fair value 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the three levels of input are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
where quoted prices are available in an active market  we determine fair value based upon quoted market prices  and classify these values in level of the valuation hierarchy 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based upon observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
when quoted prices and observable inputs are unavailable  fair values are based on internally developed cash flow models and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
the internally developed cash flow models primarily use  as inputs  estimates for interest rates and discount rates including yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors  amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the assets 
these inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing 
table of contents the assets including assumptions about risk developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of the assets being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments  when appropriate 
we record our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of various factors 
when estimating the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider historical payment patterns of our customers  the circumstances of each individual customer and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment  the age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality of our customers  and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay 
at december   no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis and include amounts related to materials  labor and overhead 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
if obsolete items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory  we will record a write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized 
accrued expenses we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional services 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on estimates of work performed or the level of patient enrollment and activities according to the protocols and agreements 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under certain contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses to the actual services received and efforts expended 
we monitor planned protocols  work performed  patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible and adjust estimates accordingly 
we record as liabilities estimated amounts for litigation  claims or other legal actions that are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations  regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain 
we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes 
as events occur  we will assess the potential liability related to any pending litigation  claims or other legal actions and adjust our estimates accordingly 
such adjustments could materially impact our financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably as the awards vest over the requisite service period  which is generally one or four years  or over the period of time we estimate that it is probable that the performance goal of a performance based option will be achieved 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
certain target stock price based options were valued using the monte carlo simulation options pricing model and recognized to expense over the service periods for each of the vesting portions of these awards which were six or eight years 
the option pricing models require the use of certain subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and the expected term of the award 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
expected term is derived from historical data on employee exercises and terminations  or the contractual life of the award for target stock price based options 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  valuation assumptions used to value stock based compensation of awards granted in future periods may change 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
furthermore  we have been notified by the internal revenue service that our us federal tax return has been selected for examination  but the examination process has not yet commenced 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
results of operations product sales and gross margin the following tables summarize the year over year changes in our product sales in thousands  in our cost of product sales in thousands and our product gross margin years ended december  change change product sales cost of product sales product gross margin product sales were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
product sales to china are denominated in us dollars and accounted for 
table of contents approximately million  million and million  or  and of sales  respectively  for the years ended december    and our revenue growth was attributable to a higher volume of zadaxin sales due to further market penetration in china and modest price increases from the to periods 
all product sales in each period were derived from sales of zadaxin 
for the year ended december   we believe there was also increased demand for zadaxin as a result of the hn flu virus 
in  shanghai lingyun pharmaceutical company ltd 
and guangdong south pharmaceutical foreign trade company ltd 
accounted for and of our sales  respectively 
in  shanghai lingyun pharmaceutical company ltd 
and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively 
in  shanghai lingyun pharmaceutical company ltd 
and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in those periods 
in recent months  sinopharm group co 
limited acquired a majority interest in two of our large importers  shanghai lingyun pharmaceutical company ltd 
and guangdong south pharmaceutical foreign trade company ltd 
we do not believe these acquisitions will impact our sales 
our experience with our largest importers has been good and we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our product to them 
we expect our unit sales for the year ending december  will increase  compared to sales for the year ended december   related to further market penetration in china  however there are discussions that government reimbursement levels in china for listed drugs could be reviewed in and that zadaxin s list price could be included in such a review 
gross margin was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for the year ended december   compared to the years ended december  and  was attributable to higher sales of zadaxin resulting in volume discounts and lower per vial production costs  and was also attributable to lower royalty expense in the and periods 
we also recorded a charge of  associated with our finished goods inventory related to vials made obsolete due to labeling requirements arising from our renewed import license in no significant charges were recorded by us associated with our product inventory during the years ended december  or we expect cost of product sales and gross margins to fluctuate from period to period depending upon the level of sales and price of zadaxin  the absorption of product related fixed costs  currency exchange fluctuations  any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory and the timing of other inventory period costs 
research and development r d the following tables summarize the year over year changes in our r d expenses in thousands years ended december  change change research and development research and development r d expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  in r d expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily related to the timing of clinical trial related expenses  including the completion of enrollment of patients in our phase a clinical trial of scv for the delay to onset of severe oral mucositis in the first quarter of and the discontinuation of the rp clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer last year 
these decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to our scv phase b clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv and oral mucositis om in the period 
the decrease of million  or  in r d expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily related to lower expenses in the year ended december  for our rp clinical trial which was discontinued  offset partially by increased expense related to our 
table of contents scv phase clinical trials for the treatment of om and hcv 
further  we made a million milestone payment upon first patient dosing in the rp phase clinical trial that occurred during the year ended december   and there was no corresponding payment in these decreases were partially offset by a million license fee payment related to our licensing agreement with apr applied pharma research sa apr that occurred during the year ended december  the major components of r d expenses include salaries and other personnel related expenses  including associated stock based compensation  facility related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  license related fees  services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers  and the sharing of certain costs for the development of zadaxin by our partner  sigma tau 
the initiation  continuation  and completion of our current clinical development programs has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
actual costs incurred in future periods will vary depending in particular upon timeline and design of further clinical trials and final decisions regarding the timing and expense sharing arrangements for these trials  though we expect our research and development expenses to increase for the year ending december   compared to those incurred for the year ended december   primarily related to our scv phase b trial in oral mucositis for which we began enrolling patients in january we are evaluating opportunities to acquire or in license the marketing rights to proprietary products primarily in china  which may result in increased research and development expenses due to license fee payments or other expenses related to in licensing and development of new products in the future

the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in conference and seminar expenses  an increase in compensation and benefits expense as a result of increased bonus and sales incentives and an increase in the number of sales personnel  and an increase in rent and business tax expense  all related to our expanding sales efforts 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  to be higher than those incurred for the year ended december  due to increased sales efforts  primarily in china

in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under which we may offer and sell up to million of our securities  assuming we continue to meet the sec s eligibility requirements for primary offerings on form s we believe that our existing cash and investments and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
we have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to our registration statement 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies  product candidates or marketing territories 
additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or  on favorable terms 
we intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations  in licensing or acquiring new products  particularly in china  and funding our clinical trials 
the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which could hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings  if any  will be sufficient to conduct and complete further clinical trials or to acquire or in license additional products 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the status of the pending regulatory investigations and pending litigations  the level and price of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and various alternatives for financing 
we have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction 
related party transactions we have licensed to our largest shareholder  sigma tau finanziaria spa sigma tau  exclusive zadaxin thymalfasin or thymosin alpha development and marketing rights that cover all countries in the european union as defined on january   in addition to iceland  norway and switzerland 
our collaboration with sigma tau is governed by an agreement entered into in with a term expiring in march unless renewed  as well as by amendments to the agreement regarding particular development efforts 
in addition  the agreement governed our joint collaboration on the development of thymalfasin in certain indications  and for the sharing of intellectual property in the respective territories 
the agreement also provides that if sigma tau sells zadaxin in the licensed territory  it will purchase the product from us at a specified price  subject to certain adjustments 
we do not currently anticipate that sigma tau will sell any zadaxin other than nominal amounts in italy 
there are no on going development or reimbursement obligations under the agreement  and there are no milestones or similar terms currently in effect 
however  we continue to cooperate with sigma tau on exploring the development of thymalfasin in other indications  including as a vaccine adjuvant and in aspergillosis

 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asu requires new disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level fair value measurements 
the asu also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding inputs and valuation techniques  as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities for which separate fair value measurements should be disclosed 
we adopted asu at the beginning of fiscal the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in money market funds  term deposits  us treasury  or government agency notes 
all of our investments mature within one year from date of purchase except for our italian state bonds which mature in our investment securities may be subject to interest rate risk and could decrease in value if market interest rates rise 
to minimize this risk  we primarily hold securities that are short term in duration and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact to the total value of our investment portfolio at december  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
most of our sales have been in us dollars 
our purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in us dollars and euros and costs of our sales and marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
in addition  we have certain cash balances  other assets and liabilities denominated in euros and renminbi 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations  and we do not hedge against the risk associated with such fluctuations 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could result in material exchange losses and could unpredictably  materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
such losses have not been significant to date
