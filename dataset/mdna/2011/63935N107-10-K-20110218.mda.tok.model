new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all segments 
our future performance will continue to depend upon the ability of our consultants to win new engagements as well as our ability to retain such consultants 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  an on site presence affords our consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings  the vast majority of our health care practice utilizes fixed billing arrangements 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenue from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
these revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 

table of contents our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of signing and retention incentive payments  stock compensation and benefits

industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries including the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the legal  construction  energy  financial services and healthcare industries 
general development of business since our inception  we have grown through the recruitment of new employees combined with acquisition investments of selective firms that are complementary to our businesses 
during  we added dispute and investigative resources with the acquisition of daylight forensic advisory llc and expanded our healthcare consulting capabilities with the acquisition of ethospartners healthcare management group  inc also during  we added significant senior talent that resulted from focused hiring initiatives in key practice areas 
in recent years  we acquired chicago partners  llc which formed the basis of our economic consulting segment and also acquired several businesses to expand our international presence in canada and the united kingdom 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions for further discussion of acquisitions made during the past three years 
financial information about business segments our business is organized in four reporting segments dispute and investigative services  business consulting services  international consulting  and economic consulting 
the economic consulting segment was added in in connection with our acquisition of chicago partners see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions 
these reporting segments are generally defined by the nature of their services and geography and may be the aggregation of multiple operating segments as indicated in the description below 
during the first quarter of  certain organizational changes were made which  along with other factors  resulted in the identification of two additional operating segments within the business consulting services segment and the repositioning of certain service offerings between the segments 
prior year comparative segment data has been restated to be consistent with the current presentation 
our business is managed and resources are allocated on the basis of the six operating segments 
the dispute and investigative services reporting segment provides a wide range of services to clients facing the challenges of disputes  litigation  forensic investigation  discovery and regulatory compliance 
the clients of this segment are principally law firms  corporate general counsel and corporate boards 
the business consulting services reporting segment provides strategic  operational  financial  regulatory and technical management consulting services to clients  principally c suite and corporate management  governmental entities and law firms 
beginning as of the first quarter of  the reporting segment has been 
table of contents comprised of three operating segments  energy  healthcare and other business consulting 
the energy and healthcare business units are defined as operating segments due to their size  importance and organizational reporting relationships 
the energy and healthcare operating segments provide services to clients in those respective markets 
other business consulting operating segment provides operations advisory  valuation and restructuring services to clients in the financial services and other markets 
the international consulting reporting segment provides a mix of dispute and business consulting services to clients predominately outside north america 
the clients are principally c suite and corporate management  governmental entities and law firms 
the economic consulting reporting segment provides economic and financial analyses of complex legal and business issues principally for law firms  corporations and governmental agencies 
expertise includes areas such as antitrust  corporate finance and governance  bankruptcy  intellectual property  investment banking  labor market discrimination and compensation  corporate valuation and securities litigation 
the segment revenues before reimbursements  segment total revenues and segment operating profit together with a reconciliation to income before income tax expense for the last three years are included in note segment information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain unallocated expense amounts related to specific reporting segments have been excluded from the segment operating profit to be consistent with the information used by management to evaluate segment performance 
segment operating profit represents total revenue less cost of services excluding long term compensation expense related to consulting personnel 
the information presented does not necessarily reflect the results of segment operations that would have occurred had the segments been stand alone businesses 
the relative percentages of revenues attributable to each segment were as follows for the year ended december  dispute and investigative services business consulting services international consulting economic consulting the relative percentages of segment operating profit attributable to each segment were as follows for the year ended december  dispute and investigative services business consulting services international consulting economic consulting segment operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues before reimbursements was as follows for the year ended december  dispute and investigative services business consulting services international consulting economic consulting total segment operating profit 
table of contents total assets by segment were as follows in thousands december  dispute and investigative services business consulting services international consulting economic consulting unallocated assets total assets unallocated assets primarily consist of cash  prepaid and other assets  deferred income tax assets and property and equipment 
human capital resources as of december   we had  employees  which represented  full time equivalent fte employees  which are total employees adjusted for part time status 
these fte employees were comprised of  consultants  project employees and non billable employees 
our revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced professionals at all levels 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts to recruit professionals with significant subject matter expertise and or consulting experience 
consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
we try to retain our consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  attractive benefits and rewarding careers 
we regularly evaluate consultant resource levels and utilization against future demand expectations and historical trends 
we may reduce resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands 
independent contractors supplement our consultants on certain engagements 
we find that hiring independent contractors on a per engagement basis from time to time allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  we have acquired and seek to acquire select consulting businesses to add highly skilled professionals  to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our general policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation including salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  other cash and equity incentives  and benefits to ensure that it is competitive within the industry  is consistent with our performance  and provides us with the ability to achieve target profitability levels 
our bill rates or fees to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience  and levels of the consulting staff 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates according to then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including 
table of contents general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
however  we believe that our independence  experience  reputation  industry focus  and broad range of professional services enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
concentration of revenues revenues earned from our top clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues earned from our top clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the years ended december   and the mix of our largest clients may change from year to year 
some of our top clients  such as certain law firms  are representatives of other organizations and those clients may change from year to year 
non us operations we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  hong kong  and dubai 
in addition  we have clients based in the united states that have international operations 
the united kingdom accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no country  other than the united states and the united kingdom  accounted for more than of our total revenues in any of the three years ended december   and our non us subsidiaries  in the aggregate  represented approximately  or million  of our total revenues in compared to  or million  in and  or million  in available information we maintain a corporate website at www

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
these factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve 
clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable 
this may reduce demand for our services  depress pricing for our services or render certain services obsolete  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in global economic conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the 
table of contents amount of business that we are able to obtain 
although we have implemented ongoing cost management measures  if we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
additionally  significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us 
these events could also adversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and therefore adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from such clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us 
we cannot be assured that we will have access to sufficient sources of capital to meet our working capital needs  to consummate future acquisitions or to repay amounts owed under our long term credit arrangements 
we maintain a million unsecured credit agreement  consisting of a million unsecured term loan facility and a million revolving line of credit  to assist in funding our short term working capital and long term cash requirements 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
our current credit facility may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business  particularly if a decline in our financial performance occurs 
if we are unable to otherwise increase our operating cash flows  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or obtain debt financing to consummate future acquisitions or to otherwise meet our working capital needs 
furthermore  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  our financial position and operating cash flows would be adversely impacted 
lastly  certain financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility could be adversely impacted by the depressed economy and therefore unable to meet their commitments under our credit facility  which in turn would reduce the amounts available to us under that facility 
our credit agreement expires in may  however  we are currently considering entering into a new credit agreement during based on current market conditions  we expect that borrowing under any new credit facility would reflect a higher cost of borrowing than our current borrowings 
additionally  our borrowings under our current credit facility tend to be higher during the first half of the year to fund our annual bonus payments and general working capital requirements  and as a result  our consolidated leverage ratio is expected to increase from december  levels 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate the term of our current credit agreement when it comes due or enter into a new credit agreement 
furthermore  the factors described above or other factors could increase our borrowing costs and impact the availability of capital to us in future periods 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
our credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor financial performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
while we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement  this could result in our having to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders to avoid the termination of their commitments and or the acceleration of the maturity of outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
the cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant  and further  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver  all amounts outstanding under our credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
our business could be impacted by competition and regulatory and legislative changes 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are global in scope 
table of contents and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
some may have lower overhead and other costs and can compete through lower cost service offerings 
there is also a risk that downward pressure on pricing may impact our profitability 
many of our clients operate in highly regulated industries such as healthcare  energy  financial services and insurance 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could impact the market for our service offerings  including potentially rendering certain of our service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
these changes could either increase or decrease our competitive position 
our business has low barriers to entry making it easy for professionals to start their own business or work independently 
in addition  it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers 
if we cannot compete effectively  or if the costs of competing  including the cost of retaining and hiring professionals  become too expensive our revenue growth and profitability could be negatively impacted 
our inability to hire and retain an appropriate level of skilled professionals could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet client needs and the success of our business 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense 
our inability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants  senior practitioners and executives  or the loss of a significant number of our employees  could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet client needs and to successfully run our business 
in particular  we rely heavily on a group of senior executives and senior practitioners and retaining their services is important to our future success 
if any of these individuals leave and we cannot quickly find suitable candidates to replace them  it could adversely impact our ability to manage our business 
further  limitations on available equity and any significant volatility or sustained decline in our stock price could impair our ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate professionals 
compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge  and our failure to realize the expected financial returns from our recruiting investments could negatively impact our results of operations  including our revenues  growth and profitability 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
our revenues  and in turn our profitability  is largely based on the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours our professionals work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  our revenues  project profit margins and profitability may suffer 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate staffing without significant underutilized personnel  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources  our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our growth strategies  and the economic  political and regulatory environment as noted above 
additionally  the profitability of our fixed fee engagements with clients may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 

table of contents our client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated without penalty 
these engagements are also frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
as a result  our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we might not meet our current or future commitments if we do not continually secure new engagements 
many of our client engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
some of our work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  healthcare reform  the credit crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes and earthquakes 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and make corresponding adjustments to our professional staffing levels  which in turn could impact our results of operations 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we carry professional liability insurance  but our insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher risk engagements and higher risk clients  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver project management services for large construction projects  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of financings 

table of contents we increasingly encounter professional conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including a conflict of interest  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations  as well as our ability to retain these consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability which may adversely impact our financial results 
our international operations create special risks 
we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  hong kong and dubai and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial  business and legal risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization  higher staffing costs  and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  burdensome regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  managing the risks associated with engagements performed by employees and independent contractors with foreign officials and governmental agencies  including the risks arising from the foreign corrupt practices act  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  including in high risk geographies  successful entry and execution in new markets  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses 
if we are not able to successfully mitigate the special risks associated with our new international markets  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various united states and foreign governmental entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to  the following governmental entities reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to governmental contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a governmental client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
governmental contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our governmental 
table of contents contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular governmental agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we have invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which we may fail to recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have developed specialized systems and processes that provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of our service offerings rely on technology or intellectual capital that is subject to rapid change 
our intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
our information technology systems will require improvements as our business grows 
the increased scale and complexity of our businesses may require additional information technology systems that we may not be able to implement in a cost effective and timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on our management team  management processes and information technology systems 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair our financial results  competitive position and ability to retain our professionals 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on our business and our results of operations 
nevertheless  even with adequate controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions 
the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
acquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have developed our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to goodwill and intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  retention of personnel  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
additionally  certain senior practitioners  as sellers of the acquired businesses  are bound by non competition covenants that expire after a specific amount of time from the date of acquisition 
when the covenants expire  our ability to retain these senior practitioners could significantly impact the acquired businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and retain personnel could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve expected results  which would in turn  adversely affect our financial performance  including possible impairment of the acquired assets 
additionally  the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets  and an impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have historically acquired a significant number of companies  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to perform an impairment test on our goodwill and long lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  attrition of key personnel  a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses  and other factors 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
if the fair market value of one of our businesses or other long term assets is less than the carrying amount of the related assets  we could be required to record an impairment charge in the future 
the valuation of the businesses requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our businesses  including such factors as market performance  changes in our client base and projected growth rates 
because these factors are ever changing  due to market and general business conditions  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  our goodwill and long lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 
at december   we had goodwill of million and net intangible assets of million 
the amount of any future impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
see note goodwill and intangible assets to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  business acquisitions  real estate and other commercial transactions 
there can be no assurances that any lawsuits or claims will be immaterial in the future

we believe we will be able to adjust our property holdings as needed but we may incur office consolidation expenses associated with reductions in our office space

overview we are an independent specialty consulting firm that combines deep industry knowledge with technical expertise to enable companies to create and protect value in the face of complex and critical business risks and opportunities 
professional services include dispute  investigative  economic  operational  risk management and financial and regulatory advisory solutions 
we provide our services to governmental agencies  legal counsel and large companies facing the challenges of uncertainty  risk  distress and significant change 
we focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change and on the issues driving these transformations 
our revenues  margins and profits have been and may continue to be impacted by a significant decline in the united states and other world economies 
examples of other impacting events that may affect us both favorably and unfavorably are natural disasters  legislative and regulatory changes  capital market disruptions  reductions in discretionary consulting spending  crises in the energy  healthcare  financial services  insurance and other industries  and significant client specific events 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenue from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
such revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of recoverable signing and retention incentive payments  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other administrative costs include marketing  technology  finance  bad debt and human capital management 
human capital resources our human capital resources include consulting professionals and non billable personnel 
as a result of both recruiting activities and business acquisitions  we have a diverse pool of consultants and administrative support staff with various skills and experience 
the average number of fte consultants is adjusted for part time status and takes into consideration hiring and attrition which occurred during the reporting period 
in addition to our consultants and non billable personnel  we hire project employees on a short term basis or seasonal basis 
we believe the practice of hiring these employees provides greater flexibility in adjusting consulting and non billable personnel levels in response to changes in demand for our professional services 
the short term or seasonal hires supplement services on certain engagements or provide additional administrative support to our consultants 

table of contents in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects

our net income increased in compared to beginning in mid and concluding in  we worked through a strategic process that resulted in the focusing of our business on four key areas disputes  energy  healthcare and economics 
in  these areas accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
as part of this realignment  certain other practices were wound down or redeployed 
table of contents and some substantial voluntary attrition followed the realignment 
weaker results in our dispute and investigative services segment primarily related to construction disputes and our international consulting segment also contributed to the decreased revenues 
these declines were partially offset by positive revenue contributions from two acquisitions as well as significant recruiting of senior level consultants 
in total  approximately million was invested in growth through acquisitions or the recruitment of senior talent 
strong markets coupled with these investments led to our energy  healthcare and economics businesses all achieving revenue growth in compared to overall  these impacts resulted in revenues that were down slightly  with revenues before reimbursements down in compared to cost of services increased modestly in from due to the costs associated with the above mentioned growth initiatives offset by the cost impacts from the wind downs and departures mentioned above as well as lower severance expense 
other operating costs benefit in were down about million from as an intangible assets impairment charge in was lower than real estate related charges in general and administrative expense declined million in compared to mainly due to lower bad debt expense 
additionally  depreciation  amortization and interest expense during were lower than as a result  net income improved in to million from while earnings per diluted share totaled in compared to in revenues before reimbursements 
our revenues before reimbursements decreased compared to average full time equivalent consultants for decreased due to higher attrition rates  the repositioning of several service lines in and certain late and early departures 
the decrease was partially offset by improvements in our average bill rate and the impact of our recent acquisitions 
the overall consultant utilization rate was and for and  respectively 
average bill rate increased for compared to  mainly as a result of a higher mix of more senior consultant utilization and overall efforts to increase rates in on a pro forma basis including the impact of our recent acquisitions in both periods  our revenues before reimbursements for would have decreased approximately from cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses were relatively consistent during and cost of services in were impacted by lower compensation expense  mainly due to wage savings from redeployment of certain service areas and cost savings initiatives which included staffing reductions and managing salary adjustments mainly in response to lower demand 
severance costs relating to cost of services during and were million and million  respectively 
these savings were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense during  as a result of improved operating performance in certain markets  higher practice development costs and the cost impact of recent acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for compared to the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of reduced bad debt expense 
average full time equivalent employees during and were and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were approximately and of revenues before reimbursements during and  respectively 
bad debt expense decreased by million in compared to and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursement to in compared to in generally  the reduction in bad debt expense reflected more timely collections from clients during and the negative impact of the financial crisis on our receivables in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on historical experience and management judgment and may change based on market conditions or specific client circumstances 
other operating costs benefit office consolidation 
during  we re occupied one floor of office space at one of our new york locations in connection with expanded business subsequent to our second quarter acquisition of daylight 
as a result  we reversed million of the accrual for future rent obligation and recorded a benefit to other operating costs 
in addition  we recorded additional costs of 
table of contents million to increase our reserves for future rent obligations for one of our abandoned chicago office spaces as a result of continued weak sublease market conditions 
during  we recorded million for office closure related costs 
the costs consisted of adjustments to office closure obligations and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements in offices to be abandoned  due to costs associated with the relocation of our new york office and a reduction in space of our los angeles office 
the office closure related costs were also negatively impacted by the adjustments to estimated future sublease income due to the poor commercial property sublease market in the united states 
our liability for abandoned real estate includes future rent obligations  net of contracted sublease and assumed sublease income 
as of december   our liability for abandoned real estate recorded as other operating costs benefit was million 
in addition  we have a liability for abandoned real estate of million which was recorded in connection with prior period acquisitions 
in determining our liabilities for office consolidation costs at december   we estimated future sublease proceeds based on market conditions of million on one property for which we do not have a contracted subtenant for the entire remaining lease obligation 
we continue to monitor our estimates for office closure obligations and related expected sublease income 
additionally  we continue to consider all options with respect to the abandoned offices  including settlements with the property owners and the timing of termination clauses under the lease 
such estimates are subject to market conditions and have been adjusted and may be adjusted in future periods as necessary 
of the million liability recorded at december   we expect to pay million in cash relating to these obligations during the next twelve months 
the office closure obligations have been discounted to net present value and are not allocated to our business segments 
other operating costs benefit intangible assets impairment 
during the three months ended december   we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of million related to customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
certain markets within the international consulting segment have experienced weaker revenues before reimbursements throughout the public services market was negatively impacted by significant reductions to public spending as a result of a change in government in the united kingdom 
in response to these reductions  we continued to implement cost reduction plans throughout the fourth quarter of as the severity and speed of the spending cuts was greater than our initial expectations 
in addition  our financial services market experienced aggressive recruiting of our consultants from larger competitors  particularly impacting fourth quarter results  as the financial services consulting markets recovered from recent disruptions in the united kingdom 
as a result of the events above and in connection with our annual planning process  we lowered the expected future growth rates and profit margins for these market segments 
these events and the resulting lower cash flows from these markets required us to review the recoverability of the related intangible assets 
during our review of intangible asset values  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets relating to the public services and financial service areas were not recoverable 
since the impairment was a non cash charge  it did not have an impact on our liquidity or financial covenants 
amortization expense 
the decrease in amortization expense of for compared to was primarily due to the lapse of amortization for certain intangible assets as such assets useful lives came to term 
the decrease was partially offset by increased amortization relating to recent acquisitions 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense for of million compared to related primarily to the expiration of an unfavorable interest rate swap in june and lower average borrowing balances under our credit agreement and our term loan 
in january  using our excess cash  we made an unscheduled repayment on our term loan of million 
our average borrowing rate under our credit agreement including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  see note comprehensive income to the notes to our consolidated financial statements was and for and  respectively 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the rate decreased in mainly due to the deemed liquidation of certain foreign entities  as allowed under an election made for us tax purposes  which resulted in the intercompany debt obligations 
table of contents held by these foreign entities to be considered uncollectible 
the election was made in connection with certain operating changes in these entities and resulted in a non recurring deduction  for us tax purposes  of million 
the non recurring tax benefit associated with this event was million during the foreign entities that made the election will be treated  for us tax purposes only  as single member limited liability companies and their resulting net income or loss will be reported on the consolidated us income tax return 
the overall lower effective tax rate during was partially offset by a lower deferred tax benefit on the international consulting segment intangible assets impairment as a result of the lower tax rate in the united kingdom 
we generated a taxable loss in the united kingdom during and had net deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against the united kingdom deferred tax assets  because we believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets are recoverable from future results of operations 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our financial results and effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate is attributable to the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions  including state and foreign jurisdictions  which have different income tax rates 
results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  earnings summary 
net income for decreased compared to our revenues and net income were lower in compared to due to the impact of unprecedented economic conditions on discretionary consulting spend by our clients as well as significant disruption in the law firm channel which led to delays  postponements and slower consultant spending in our dispute and investigative services segment 
overall utilization was lower in when compared to and the average bill rate declined in compared to average full time equivalent consultants totaled  for  which was down by approximately from as we adjusted our staffing to better align with market demand 
in  both cost of services before reimbursable expenses and general and administrative expenses were significantly lower than the corresponding expense amounts in  reflecting the impact of numerous cost reduction initiatives implemented throughout net income was also negatively impacted by higher severance costs of million in compared to million in and office consolidation expense of million and million in and  respectively 
revenues before reimbursements 
our revenues before reimbursements decreased compared to there was lower demand for our services due to a weaker economy and reduced spending on discretionary consulting services which resulted in lower billable hours and reduced consultant headcount 
all industry sectors decreased over the prior year primarily due to the poor economic conditions except for the economics and energy markets 
our revenue reflected a full year of results from our economics business which we acquired in may and the energy markets reflected solid demand for our clean energy consulting services 
our overall consultant utilization rate was for compared to for  reflecting the impact of lower demand 
in addition  the stronger us dollar negatively impacted the revenues from our uk and canadian operations by million 
assuming our acquisitions during operated at historic run rates  those acquisitions would have partially offset the year over year decrease in revenues before reimbursements by approximately 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses decreased during compared to the decrease was a result of our cost saving initiatives which included staffing reductions  managing salary adjustments and reducing discretionary costs primarily in response to lower demand 
the staffing reductions reduced consultant compensation expense in compared to  mainly due to wage savings and lower incentive compensation expense as a result of lower operating performance and profits 
this decrease was partially offset by expense amortization relating to long term incentive and retention agreements entered into during the second and third quarters of  our acquisition of chicago partners in may  and significantly higher severance charges incurred during as we aligned our resources to the decreased demand 
average full time equivalent headcount decreased

bad debt expense decreased during by million compared to and represented approximately of revenues before reimbursements in both years  reflecting a higher allowance as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements compared to prior years  due to the recent economic crisis and due to the aging of our accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on historical experience and management judgment and may change based on market conditions or specific client circumstances 
other operating costs office consolidation 
during and we recorded million and million  respectively  of office closure related costs which consisted of adjustments to office closure obligations  the write down of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements in offices to be abandoned in future periods 
during  we began a program to eliminate duplicate facilities and to consolidate and close certain offices 
during  office closure related costs increased compared to primarily due to costs associated with the relocation of our new york office and a reduction in space of our los angeles office 
the office closure related costs were also negatively impacted by the adjustments to estimated future sublease income due to the poor commercial property sublease market in the united states 
we continue to monitor our estimates for office closure obligations and related expected sublease income 
such estimates are subject to market conditions and may be adjusted in the future periods as necessary 
the office closure obligations have been discounted to net present value 
in the next twelve months we expect our cash expenditures to be million relating to these obligations 
in determining our reserves for office consolidation expenses at december   we estimated future sublease proceeds based on market conditions of million on three properties for which we do not have a contracted subtenant 
amortization expense 
the decrease in amortization expense of million for compared to was primarily due to the lapse of amortization for certain intangible assets as such assets useful lives came to term

severe reduction in public spending contributed to the overall weakness in this segment

operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of business days in a quarter  
table of contents employee hiring and utilization rates 
the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter due to various factors  including the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  attaining certain contractual objectives  the size and scope of assignments  and general economic conditions 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of client assignments  or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
operating results are also impacted by other operating costs 
in addition  interest expense and interest income fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of balance changes in cash and debt 
liquidity and capital resources our cash equivalents are primarily limited to money market accounts or a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
our net debt level total debt less cash on hand at december  increased approximately million from december  due to investments in acquisitions and senior talent recruiting 
acquisition investments totaled million of investing cash flow for  while senior talent related recruiting investments included in operating cash flows were approximately million during in january  we used million in excess cash to prepay a portion of our term loan borrowings 
these higher investments were partially offset by approximately million in lower capital expenditures 
during  leasehold improvement spending decreased while software and hardware related costs increased mainly due to the implementation of phase one of our erp system 
we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance  net of reserves and deferred revenue credits  at the end of the quarter  by daily net revenues 
daily net revenues are calculated by taking quarterly net revenues divided by days  approximately equal to the number of days in a quarter 
calculated as such  dso was days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  the increase in dso was generally attributable to slower client payments associated with specific client situations 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for  compared to million and million provided by operating activities for and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to resulted from several factors including increased investment in signing incentives for hires and greater investment in working capital associated with our increased fourth quarter revenue  partially offset by increased net income 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from lower net income partially offset by a decrease in investments in working capital 
the decreased investment in working capital year over year was primarily related to incentive loans issued during the second and third quarters of see discussion of unsecured forgivable loans in note supplemental consolidated balance sheet information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in the use of cash in compared to resulted primarily from our acquisitions of daylight and ethospartners offset by lower capital spending on property and equipment expenditures 
capital spending was higher in mainly due to leasehold improvements at a new office located in new york city and software license agreements 
during  we paid million for the cash portion of the purchase price for chicago partners payable at closing 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
during  we used million of excess cash to prepay loan borrowings which was offset by borrowings under our revolving 
table of contents credit facility to fund our acquisitions 
our financing activities included million of payments of notes relating to prior years acquisitions 
debt  commitments and capital as of december   we maintained an unsecured credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility which  subject to certain bank approvals  includes an option to increase to million and a million unsecured term loan facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are payable in may our credit agreement provides for borrowings in multiple currencies including us dollars  canadian dollars  uk pound sterling and euro 
as of december   we had aggregate borrowings of million  compared to million as of december  based on our financial covenant restrictions under our credit facility as of december   a maximum of approximately million would be available in additional borrowings under our credit facility 
in january  we used a portion of our cash to prepay million of our term loan facility under our credit facility which reduced future required quarterly payments on a pro rata basis 
at our option  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of total funded debt to adjusted ebitda and whether the loan is made under the term loan facility or revolving credit facility 
as of december   the applicable margins on libor loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
as of december   the applicable margins for base rate loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and zero  respectively 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary between to depending upon our performance and financial condition 
our average borrowing rate under our credit agreement including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  see note comprehensive income to the notes to our consolidated financial statements was and for and  respectively 
our credit agreement also includes certain financial covenants  including covenants that require that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of adjusted ebitda and rental expense to the sum of cash interest expense and rental expense of not less than at december   under the definitions in the credit agreement  our consolidated leverage ratio was and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was in addition to the financial covenants  our credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and is subject to customary exceptions 
these covenants limit our ability to incur liens or other encumbrances or make investments  incur indebtedness  enter into mergers  consolidations and asset sales  pay dividends or other distributions  change the nature of our business and engage in transactions with affiliates 
on december   we amended our credit agreement to correct a technical issue relating to the level of foreign investments we are permitted to make under the restrictive covenants set forth in the agreement 
the amendment corrected the initial investment schedule and increased the threshold of permitted investments in foreign borrowers from million to million 
we paid a de minimus fee to each of the lenders who consented to the amendment 
we were in compliance with the terms of our credit agreement as of december  and  however there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance in the future 
as of december   we had total commitments of million 
as of december   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table shows the components of 
table of contents significant commitments as of december  and the scheduled years of payments due by period shown in thousands contractual obligations total to to thereafter deferred purchase price obligations employment agreements revolving credit facility term loan lease commitments during  we began a program to eliminate duplicate facilities  consolidate and close certain offices 
of the million lease commitments as of december   million of the lease commitments related to offices we have abandoned or reduced excess space within  which have been subleased or are available for sublease 
as of december   we had contractual subleases of million  which is not reflected in the commitment table above 
such sublease income would offset the cash outlays 
additionally  we intend to secure subtenants for the properties available for sublease to offset the rent payments and will seek to exercise termination clauses  if any  to shorten the term of the lease commitments 
such sublease income  if any  would offset the cash outlays 
the lease commitments for these offices extend through we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide adequate cash to fund anticipated short term and long term cash needs from normal operations  however  we are evaluating extending our current credit agreement or entering into a new credit agreement as noted below 
in the event we make significant cash expenditures in the future for major acquisitions or other activities  we might need additional debt or equity financing  as appropriate 
additionally  our credit agreement is with a syndicate of several banks 
these banks could be negatively impacted by the recent disruptions in the financial markets 
our credit agreement expires in may  however  we are currently considering entering into a new credit agreement during based on current market conditions  we expect that borrowing under any new credit facility would reflect a higher cost of borrowing than our current borrowings 
additionally  our borrowings under our current credit facility tend to be higher during the first half of each year to fund our annual bonus payments and general working capital requirements  and as a result  our consolidated leverage ratio is expected to increase from december  levels 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate the term of our current credit agreement when it comes due or enter into a new credit agreement 
furthermore  the factors described above or other factors could increase our borrowing costs and impact the availability of capital to us in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues as the related professional services are provided 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether 
table of contents one or more units of accounting are present 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services 
the recording of these fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenue from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
such revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
any taxes assessed on revenues relating to services provided to our clients are recorded on a net basis 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
notes receivable and prepaid signing and retention bonuses we grant and pay sign on and retention bonuses to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 
generally  we require grantees to sign incentive recovery agreements  which obligate the grantees to fulfill a service term  typically between two to five years 
if such service term is not fulfilled  the monetary equivalent of the uncompleted service term is required to be paid back to us 
we record paid sign on and retention bonuses to prepaid expenses and other assets and the bonuses are amortized as compensation expense over the service period as defined by the incentive recovery agreements 
certain sign on and retention bonus of relatively low amounts are expensed to compensation expense when paid 
we also issue notes receivable in the form of unsecured forgivable loans to recruit and retain highly skilled professionals 
the principal amount and accrued interest is expected to be forgiven by us over the term of the loans  typically between three to five years  so long as the professionals continue employment and comply with certain contractual requirements 
the expense associated with the forgiveness of the principal amount of the loans and accrued interest is recorded as compensation expense over the service period  which is consistent with the term of the loans 
the accrued interest is calculated based on the loan s effective interest rate and is recorded as interest income 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  employee training methodology and materials  backlog revenue and trade names 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption  ranging up to nine years 
our long term assets are subject to changes in events or circumstances that could impact their carrying value 
we do not amortize goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during our second quarter 
we also review goodwill and long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset 
we consider elements and other factors including  but not limited to  changes in the business climate in which we operate  attrition of key personnel  unanticipated competition  our market capitalization in excess of our book value  our recent operating performance  and our financial projections 
our impairment testing and reviews may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  market valuation of comparable companies  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
a decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units or other long term assets could result in impairment charges 

table of contents we review our intangible asset values on a periodic basis 
during  we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of million related to customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
certain markets within the international consulting segment have experienced weaker revenues before reimbursements throughout the public services market was negatively impacted by significant reductions in public spending as a result of a change in government in the united kingdom 
in response to these reductions  we continued to implement cost reduction plans throughout the fourth quarter of as the severity and speed of the spending cuts was greater than our initial expectations 
in addition  our financial services market experienced aggressive recruiting of our consultants from larger competitors  particularly impacting fourth quarter results  as the financial services consulting markets recovered from recent disruptions in the united kingdom 
as a result of the events above and in connection with our annual planning process  we lowered the expected future growth rates and profit margins for these market segments 
these events and the resulting lower cash flows from these markets required us to review the recoverability of the related intangible assets 
during our review of intangible asset values  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets relating to the public services and financial service areas were not recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test is performed using a two step  fair value based test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one 
the impairment test is considered for each reporting unit as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets which are the same as our operating segments 
as of december   we have six operating segments which are also considered to be our reporting units as defined by the accounting standard for goodwill  as follows healthcare  energy and other business consulting  which comprise our business consulting services reporting segment  dispute and investigative services  international consulting  and economic consulting 
during the first step  we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using estimated future cash flows and terminal values 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
the achievement of such internal projections and operating plans will be impacted by the overall economic environment  among other factors 
the estimated fair value of our six reporting units is subject to  among other things  changes in our estimated business future growth rate  profit margin  long term outlook  market valuations of comparable companies  the ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments  competitive environment and weighted average cost of capital 
during the first quarter of  certain organizational changes were made which  along with other factors  resulted in an increase in the number of our operating segments from four to six and the repositioning of certain service offerings between the segments 
in connection with these changes during the first quarter of  we completed an interim impairment test of our goodwill balances 
at that time  we completed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed 
our annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the second quarter of and was completed based on our six reporting units 
at that time  we completed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed 
during the fourth quarter of  our average stock price traded near or below our book value for a prolonged period of time 
additionally  we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of million  relating to certain customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
as a result of these factors  we completed an interim impairment test of our goodwill balances as of november  at that time  we completed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed 

table of contents as of our november  analysis  the excess of estimated fair value over net asset carrying value of our reporting units was lower than our previous goodwill analyses and approximated for healthcare and energy  for dispute and investigative services  international consulting and economic consulting  and for other business consulting services 
in determining estimated fair value of our reporting units  we generally used internal projections completed during our annual planning process 
the key assumptions reflected profit margin improvement that was generally consistent with our longer term historical performance  revenue growth rates that were higher than our peer group in the near term  discount rates that were determined based on comparables for our peer group and cost of capital that was based on company averages 
in general  growth rates used in our november  analysis were lower than our prior goodwill analysis except for the international consulting and economic consulting reporting units  which have had recent strategic senior practitioner additions  and the profit margin expectations used in our november  analysis for all reporting units were lower than those used in our prior goodwill analysis  particularly in the international consulting reporting unit 
our fair value estimates were made as of the date of our analysis and are subject to change 
as the excess of estimated fair value over the net asset carrying value of our reporting units decreases  there is increased risk that the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be required  and that goodwill impairment could result 
all of our reporting units experienced a decrease in the estimated fair value over net asset carrying value with the dispute and investigative services  international consulting and economic consulting segments having the smallest excess at approximately 
our international consulting fair value may be more sensitive to volatility in the future due to its smaller size  assumed higher growth rates  involvement in emerging markets and exposure to multiple markets outside the united states 
the higher growth rates are based on our ability to leverage current and future investments and other factors which may be beyond our control 
additionally  certain markets within the reporting unit have been adversely impacted by recent government spending reductions in the united kingdom and aggressive recruiting of our consultants  resulting in poor operating performance and the impairment of certain intangible assets as described above 
the economic consulting reporting unit is substantially comprised of recent acquisitions and its estimated fair value depends on various factors including the success of those acquisitions and the ability to leverage our recent investments 
the economic consulting reporting unit fair value also assumes higher growth rates and is subject to volatility due to its smaller size 
the dispute and investigative services reporting unit is our largest and its fair value will depend on its ability to achieve successful profitable growth 
as we review our portfolio of services in the future  we may exit certain markets or reposition certain service offerings within our business 
consistent with past evaluations  further evaluations may result in our redefining our operating segments and may impact a significant portion of one or more of our reporting units 
as noted above  if such actions occur  they may be considered triggering events that would result in our performing an interim impairment test of our goodwill and an impairment test of our intangible assets 
we use various methods to determine fair value  including market  income and cost approaches 
with these approaches  we adopt certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
inputs to the valuation can be readily observable  market corroborated  or unobservable 
we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value measurements used for our goodwill impairment testing use significant unobservable inputs which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in measuring fair value including risk considerations 
the fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium  among other things 
share based payments we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  such as our stock option and restricted stock plans  in the financial statements based on their fair value 
management judgment is required in order to i estimate the fair value of certain share based payments  ii determine expected 
table of contents attribution period and iii assess expected future forfeitures 
we treat our employee stock purchase plan as compensatory and record the purchase discount from market price of stock purchases by employees as share based compensation expense 
income taxes we account for deferred income taxes utilizing an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
when appropriate  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our effective tax rate 
we generated a taxable loss in the united kingdom during and have net deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against the united kingdom deferred tax assets  because we believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets are recoverable from future results of operations 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our financial results and effective tax rate 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
measurement of tax positions requires management judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
other operating costs benefit office consolidation we recorded expense and related liabilities associated with office closings and excess space reductions related to a plan to reduce office space as other operating costs 
the expense consisted of rent obligations for the offices  net of expected sublease income  and the write down and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements reflecting the changes in the estimated useful lives of our abandoned offices 
the expected sublease income is subject to market conditions and has been adjusted and may be adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the office closure obligations have been discounted to net present value 
the determination of the expense and related liabilities requires management judgment and could impact our future financial results

the elimination of these requirements to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting will put more focus on a vendor s assessment of whether delivered items in multiple element arrangements have standalone value 
the update is effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   however  earlier adoption is permitted

in april  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasized that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of the multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination arising from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated

the guidance also sets forth the disclosures required to be made in the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the

the foreign currency risk is associated with our operations in foreign countries 
as of december   borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to the fluctuations in libor 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor 
in december  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements of equal amounts with four different banks for an aggregate notional value of million 
these agreements effectively fixed million of our libor base rate indebtedness at an average rate of beginning july  through may  in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements of equal amounts with two different banks for an aggregate notional value of million 
these agreements effectively fixed million of our libor base rate indebtedness at an average rate of beginning july  through may  on june   our million notional amount interest rate swap matured 
as of december   our interest rate swaps effectively fixed our libor base rate on million of our debt 
based on borrowings under the credit agreement at december  and after giving effect to the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  our interest rate exposure is limited to million of debt  and each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a million change in annual interest expense 
at december   our investments were primarily limited to a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we operate in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the uk pound sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively 
at december   we had net assets denominated in the non functional currency of approximately million 
as a result  a ten percent change in the value of the local currency would result in a million currency gain or loss in our results of operations
