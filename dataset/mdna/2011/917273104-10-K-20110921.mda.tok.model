item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under risk factors in item a 
all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix develops  manufactures  and markets non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph  a disease that affects more than million men worldwide 
we market our control units under the coolwave and targis names and our procedure kits  that consist of a disposable treatment catheter  rectal thermal unit rtu balloon and coolant bag  under the ctc advance  targis  and prostaprobe names 
all systems utilize the company s cooled thermotherapy ctt technology  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph by the thermal ablation of hyperplasic prostatic tissue 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without general anesthesia or intravenous sedation and can be performed in a urologist s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe that cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph with results clinically superior to medication and without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the continued adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy will be keys to maintaining such reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive cooled thermotherapy treatment in the united states are eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will be covered by either private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
we will continue to invest in research and development and clinical trials to improve our products and our therapy 
these investments are intended to broaden our product offering and expand the clinical evidence supporting our proprietary cooled thermotherapy treatment for bph 
we continue to highlight our five year durability data and the ability of urologists using our system to customize the treatment for patients 
we have incurred net losses of million in fiscal year  and million and million in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in addition  we have accumulated aggregate net losses since the inception of business through june  of million 
subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we entered into a license agreement with medtronic and paid medtronic  of the  initial license fee on september  as a result of our history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  the licensing fee and integration expenses related to the prostiva product  and the uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain additional capital  our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary as a result of this uncertainty 
as stated in our press release of september  announcing the prostiva rf therapy system license  we expect revenues in fiscal year from the combined ctt and prostiva product lines to be in the range of to million 
our actual revenue results could differ materially from our expectation as a result of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in item a risks factors of this form k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy control units with customers free of charge under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use  and also provide access to cooled thermotherapy treatments via our urologix mobile service 
we retain title to the control units placed with our customers for evaluation and longer term use 
these programs  as well as our urologix mobile service  are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue for the free use of our cooled thermotherapy control units are bundled with the sale of single use treatment catheters and are considered a single unit of accounting 
revenue from the bundled sales is recognized when the single use treatment catheters are shipped to our customers 
revenue from our mobile service is recognized upon treatment of the patient 
revenue for extended warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and specific customer based circumstances 
should actual sales returns differ from our estimates  revisions to the sales return reserve would be required 
sales and use taxes are reported on a net basis  excluding them from revenue 
inventories we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if estimated fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
in fiscal year  we did not generate positive cash flows from operations 
if our long term future plans do not yield positive cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  we would anticipate possible future impairments of those assets 
considerable management judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows and other factors affecting the valuation of long lived assets  including the operating and macroeconomic factors that may affect them 
we use historical financial information  internal plans and projections and industry information in making such estimates 

table of contents income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
we have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination 
we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
at june   we carried a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation the company uses the fair value recognition provisions of the revised authoritative guidance for equity based compensation and applies the modified prospective method in determining stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period which corresponds to the vesting period 
options and restricted stock awards typically vest percent after the first year of service with the remaining vesting th each month thereafter 
generally  options granted to non employee directors are immediately exercisable at the date of grant while restricted stock awards generally vest after one year 
options are priced based on the closing price of a share of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model  we use historical data to estimate expected volatility and the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the range of these assumptions and the range of option pricing and number of options granted at the different grant dates will impact our calculation of the fair value of the awards and will therefore impact the amount of expense reflected in our statement of operations for any given period 
fair value for restricted stock is based on the market price on the day of grant 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in sales from fiscal year is primarily due to decreased orders in all sales channels direct  mobile and third party mobile 
during fiscal year  revenue from catheter sales to direct accounts constituted percent of sales compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while catheter sales to third party mobiles constituted percent of revenue in the current fiscal year compared to percent in fiscal year revenue derived from the urologix mobile service constituted percent of total sales in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the remaining three percent of our sales in fiscal year were from sales of our control units  warranty service contracts  and non kit items 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy control units and single use treatment catheters  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our urologix mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased to million  or percent  from million in fiscal year this decrease in cost of goods sold is attributed to the percent decrease in sales year over year  partially offset by higher manufacturing expense per unit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the four percentage point decrease in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is a result of higher manufacturing expense per unit due to lower production volume of our treatment catheters  which provided a smaller base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 

table of contents selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is the result of a  decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to the  decrease in commission expense resulting from the lower sales volume 
in addition  general and administrative expenses decreased by  due to a  decrease in bonus expense and a  decrease in legal and audit expenses 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  increased to million for fiscal year  an increase of percent from million in fiscal year the increase in research and development is due to a  increase in wages as a result of an increase in headcount  as well as an  increase in product testing and project materials as we continue to invest in research and development activities 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in the bonus accrual 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets remained consistent at  in fiscal years and this amortization expense relates to the amortization of our remaining customer base intangible asset over its remaining useful life of years 
net interest income interest income remained relatively consistent between fiscal years and at approximately  provision for income taxes we recorded  of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to an  income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  the  of income tax for the fiscal year ended june  was the result of recording  of state income tax expense partially offset by a small federal benefit of  the  income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  was the result of recording an income tax benefit of  related to a net operating loss carry back claim to recapture alternative minimum tax paid during fiscal years and and  related to research and development credits 
this income tax benefit was partially offset by the recording of  of state income tax expense 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased percent to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in sales from fiscal year was primarily due to increased orders for procedure kits as well as an increase in the number of cooled thermotherapy mobile treatments performed 
during fiscal year  revenue from catheter sales to direct accounts constituted percent of sales compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while catheter sales to third party mobiles constituted percent of revenue in the current fiscal year compared to percent in fiscal year revenue derived from the urologix mobile service constituted percent of total sales in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the remaining two percent of our sales in fiscal year were from sales of our warranty service contracts  non kit items and other miscellaneous items 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy control units and single use treatment catheters  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our urologix mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year increased to million or percent from million in fiscal year this increase in cost of goods sold was attributed to the percent increase in sales year over year 
this overall increase was offset by a lower manufacturing expense per unit 

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the six percentage point increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was a result of lower manufacturing expense per unit due to higher production volume of our treatment catheters  which provided a larger base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  the delivery cost per treatment for our mobile service decreased by from the prior year 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was largely the result of a reversal of  for a sales tax accrual in the first quarter of fiscal year and a net increase of  for commissions and bonuses achieved during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in freight and shipping costs  a decrease in audit and professional fees of  and a decrease in our stock based compensation expense of  due to the lower grant date fair value of options in recent periods 
in addition  as part of the company s expense reduction efforts  meeting expense decreased by  and recruiting  insurance and travel expense decreased by  research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million for fiscal year  a decline of percent from million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development was due to a  decrease in consulting and legal fees  a  decrease in payroll expenses due to employee turnover and a  decrease in expenses associated with clinical studies  offset by a  increase in temporary labor and outside services 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets remained consistent at  in fiscal years and this amortization expense relates to the amortization of our remaining customer base intangible asset over its remaining useful life of years 
net interest income due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in fiscal year  net interest income was less than  and is  therefore  not included on the face of the income statement compared to  in fiscal year provision for income taxes we recorded  of income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june  the  of income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  was the result of recording an income tax benefit of  related to a net operating loss carry back claim to recapture alternative minimum tax paid during fiscal years and and  related to research and development credits 
this income tax benefit was partially offset by the recording of  of state income tax expense 
the  of income tax expense for fiscal year june  was the result of the recording of  of state income tax expense partially offset by  of an income tax benefit related to research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our net operating loss of million in fiscal year 
table of contents subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we entered into a license agreement with medtronic and paid medtronic  of the  initial license fee on september  primarily due to this licensing payment  acquisition and integration related expenses  the net loss incurred in the current business and one time annual operating expenses such as insurance premiums  as of september  our cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately million 
the significant decrease in our cash balance in the first quarter of fiscal year is not expected to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as the cash outflows in the first quarter related to the annual payments and the licensing fee will not occur again in fiscal year in addition  as part of the licensing agreement  payments for prostiva products and royalties are deferred into the next fiscal year while collections of prostiva revenue commence immediately 
as a result of our history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  the licensing fee and integration expenses related to the prostiva product  and the uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain additional capital  our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to sustain our day to day operations for the next months and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving our liquidity 
while our primary goal is to generate capital through cash flow from operations  we are also pursuing financing alternatives 
we intend to seek additional financing by incurring indebtedness or from an offering of our equity securities or both 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing 
if the company does obtain such financing  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be obtained in an amount that is sufficient for our needs  in a timely manner  or on terms and conditions acceptable to us or our shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital in an amount sufficient for our needs and in a timely manner  we may be required to further reduce our expenses and curtail our capital expenditures  sell our assets  or suspend or discontinue our operations 
the fiscal year financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year  we used million of cash from operating activities compared to million in fiscal year primarily as a result of the increase in our net operating loss 
the net loss included non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization expense and  of stock based compensation expense 
changes in asset and liability balances generated  of operating cash flow for the year as a result of a decrease in inventory levels of  as a result of reduced production  an increase in accounts payable balance of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses of  partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and deferred income of  largely as a result of a decrease in accrued compensation 
cash used for investing activities we used  for investing activities primarily to purchase leasehold improvements related to a tenant improvement allowance as a result of signing a building lease extension 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year  we generated  from financing activities as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual commitments we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use of our cooled thermotherapy control units in addition to purchase options  as well as grow our mobile service which provides urologists and patients with efficient access to our cooled thermotherapy control units on a pre scheduled basis 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately  of control units used in evaluation or longer term use programs and units used in our company owned mobile service 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance these programs 

table of contents future contractual commitments that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands fiscal years building and equipment leases off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting standards information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in note to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash equivalent instruments 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair value of these instruments  as our investments are variable rate investments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and was not materially different from the quarter end carrying value 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents instruments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
