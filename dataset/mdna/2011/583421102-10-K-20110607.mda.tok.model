effective december   we completed the sale of our consumer business  including our cayman island subsidiary  measurement limited ml  to fervent group limited fgl 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the periods ended march   and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
executive summary our vision is to be the supplier of choice to oems and select end users for all their physical sensing needs 
to that end  meas continues to expand our market position as a leading global sensor supplier 
our sales growth exceeds overall market increases  as supported by our six year compounded annual growth rate cagr in excess of 
the company s strong recovery after the recession reflects the positive returns from our significant investments in research and development for new programs and the  invested in our acquisitions since june  expanding our product offering and geographic reach 
the company remains focused on creating long term shareholder value through continued development of innovative technologies and strengthening our market position by expanding customer relationships 
to accomplish this goal  we continue to take measures we believe will result in higher sales performance in excess of the overall market and generation of positive earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
a core tenant of our long term strategy to increase profitability is to grow the size and scale of the company in order to improve our leverage of sg a expenses 
accordingly  our goal is to target a ebitda margin ebitda as a percent of net sales 
we have implemented aggressive actions that position the company for future growth in sales and profitability  all of which we ultimately expect to translate to enhanced shareholder value 
we currently have one of the strongest product development pipelines in the history of the company  which we expect to lay the foundation for future sales growth 
research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations for new sales and to improve profitability 
our broad range of products and geographic diversity provide the company with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology  products  manufacturing base and our financial performance 
the following charts provide an overall indicative range of the diversity of our sales by region and by market for fiscal 
pgjpg 
general oem represents a broad range of end use markets and includes such markets as general industrial  home appliance and other consumer markets  as described in the earlier section titled products  markets and applications 
on september   the company completed its first acquisition in months with the purchase of pressure systems  inc psi 
acquisitions remain a key component of the company s growth strategy  though there is no specific timetable for any acquisitions 
trends there are a number of trends that we expect to have material effects on the company s future operating results  including improving global economic conditions with the resulting impact on our sales  profitability  and capital spending  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  shifts in our overall effective tax rate  changes in our debt levels and applicable interest rates  and prices of raw materials and other costs  such as labor 
additionally  sales and results of operations could be impacted by additional acquisitions 
overall  the company expects moderate double digit sales growth during as compared to we believe the majority of the improvement in our sales is due to improved overall demand  as well as increased market penetration 
a significant portion of our sales are driven by overall economic activity and not necessarily conditions in one particular industry  reflecting our high degree of geographic  industry and product diversity 
in future periods  we expect the sensor market will continue to perform well relative to the overall economy as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets in the us  europe and asia 
sensor content continues to increase at a faster rate than overall product unit growth  as oems add intelligence in products across most market verticals to promote improved energy efficiency and cleaner technologies  to meet regulatory compliance requirements and to improve user safety and convenience 
as detailed in the following graph  the company continues to post consecutive quarters with higher net sales and higher adjusted ebitda on a trailing quarter to quarter comparison 
sales bottomed out due to the global recession during our fourth quarter of fiscal economic conditions continue to be challenging and there is uncertainty as to the strength of the economic recovery with  among other factors  varying rates of economic recovery  the euro zone debt crisis  high unemployment  weaknesses in the housing market  and the impact of the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures provide important supplemental information 
the company considers adjusted ebitda an important financial measure because it provides a financial measure of the quality of the company s earnings from a cash flow perspective prior to taking into account the effects of changes in working capital and purchases of property and equipment and debt service 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is used by management in addition to and in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with gaap 
additionally  we believe quarterly adjusted ebitda provides the current run rate for trending purposes rather than a trailing twelve month historical amount 
the following table details quarterly net sales and also provides a non gaap reconciliation of quarterly adjusted ebitda to the applicable gaap financial measures 
quarter ended net sales as adjusted quarterly adjusted ebitda as adjusted quarterly adjusted ebitda margin income loss from continuing operations interest foreign currency exchange loss gain depreciation and amortization income taxes as adjusted share based compensation other adjusted ebitda income from continuing operations before interest  foreign currency exchange loss gain  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  share based compensation and other 
other represents legal fees incurred related to certain international traffic in arms regulations matters 
adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda divided by net sales 
as adjusted reflects the deconsolidation of n t in accordance with retrospective adoption in fiscal of new accounting principles for consolildation 
the primary factors that impact our costs of revenue include production and sales volumes  product sales mix  foreign currency exchange rates  especially with the chinese rmb  changes in the price of raw materials and the impact of various cost control measures 
we expect our gross margins during fiscal to range from approximately to  primarily reflecting stability in our product sales mix and overall volume of business  as well as assuming no significant appreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
gross margins for certain quarters could be outside this expected range based upon a range of possible factors 
gross margins have trended down over the past several years  largely due to unfavorable product sales mix both in terms of organic growth and acquired sales and the impact of the increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
however  our gross margins increased in fiscal as compared to the prior year mainly because of the increase in overall volume of business after the recession 
as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business ie  economies of scale in that certain costs are fixed and certain production costs are capitalized in inventory based on normal production volumes 
since our overall level of business increased in fiscal  our gross margins and overall level of profits increased accordingly 
we expect continued pressures on our gross margins given our expectation that costs  including raw material and labor costs  will increase 
during  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar 
there are indications this trend may continue in the near term 
we estimate in for every increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar  our gross margins decline by approximately total selling  general and administrative expense total sg a as a percentage of net sales was lower in fiscal as compared to the prior year  mainly reflecting our ability to successfully leverage our sg a expense by growing sales at a higher rate than sg a expenses 
as a percent of sales  total sg a for was  as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
we are expecting in a decrease in our sg a as a percentage of net sales mainly due to higher sales  which is expected to be partially offset by continued investment in r d for new programs and higher non cash equity based compensation 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs increased over the past two years mainly due to the acquisitions of psi in and atexis and fgp in the acquisitions 
amortization is disproportionately loaded more in the initial years of the acquisition  and therefore amortization expense is higher in the quarters immediately following a transaction  and declines in later years based on how various intangible assets are valued and amortized 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal  assuming no new acquisitions 
in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar relative to the rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures related to balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
foreign currency exchange fx losses or gains due to the revaluation of local subsidiary balance sheet accounts with realized and unrealized fx transactions increased sharply in recent years  because of  among other factors  volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  our swiss company  which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss francs 
these fx transaction gains and losses are reflected in our foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables and payables in foreign currencies 
we recorded net fx losses of in  net fx gains of in and net fx losses of in the company s operations outside of the us and the volume of business denominated in other currencies have expanded over the years from acquisitions 
we expect to see continued fx losses or gains associated with volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses and may continue to use foreign currency contracts to hedge these fx exposures 
the company does not hedge all of its fx exposures  but has accepted some exposure to exchange rate movements 
the company does not apply hedge accounting when derivative financial instruments are used to manage these fx exposures 
since the company does not apply hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of those derivative financial instruments are reported in earnings in the fx gains or losses caption 
we expect the value of the us dollar will continue to fluctuate relative to the rmb  euro  swiss franc and japanese yen 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amounts of sales  profits  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate as a result of the allocation of earnings among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and their varying tax rates 
this is particularly challenging due to the different timing and rates of economic recovery as economies around the world try to recover from the recession 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to range from approximately to approximately  an increase as compared to the prior year  excluding discrete items 
the increase in the estimated overall effective tax rate mainly reflects the shift of taxable earnings to tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
additionally  last year s effective tax rate was impacted by a number of discrete items 
the overall estimated effective tax rate is based on expectations and other estimates and involves complex domestic and foreign tax issues  which the company monitors closely  but are subject to change 
in fiscal  the company s subsidiary in china  meas china  received approval from the chinese authorities for high new technology enterprise hnte status 
hnte status decreased the tax rate for meas china from to through december  to qualify for this reduced rate the company must continue to meet various criteria in regard to its operations related to sales  research and development activity  and intellectual property rights 
if the company does not continue to receive hnte status  the company s income tax rate in china would increase to 
on february   the company s board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing the buy back of up to  of meas common stock 
as of march   the company completed the approved repurchase amount 
as permitted by amendment dated may  under our senior credit agreement  the company is limited to a cumulative amount of  for payments related to stock buy backs  of which payments totaling  have been made to date 
the company expects to continue investing in various capital projects in fiscal  and capital spending in is expected to approximate  this level of capital spending is higher than in fiscal  reflecting improved economic conditions and investments in new programs to generate new sales 
changes in our business acquisitions and divestures on september   the company completed its first acquisition in months with the purchase of psi  a sensor company based in hampton  virginia 
psi is a global leader in pressure sensing instrumentation for the aerospace industry and for water monitoring within operational and resource management applications 
the water monitoring industry is large and a significant growth opportunity for the company 
additionally  the company expects to achieve cost synergies with the psi business combination mainly through the consolidation of operations due to the close proximity of the acquisition to the company s existing hampton facility 
the company made two acquisitions during fiscal atexis expanded our temperature sensors and probes utilizing ntc  platinum pt and thermo couples technologies and increased our temperature manufacturing base through wholly owned subsidiaries in france and china 
fgp was a competitor of custom force  pressure and vibration sensors for aerospace and test and measurement markets 
effective december   we completed the sale of the consumer segment to fervent group limited fgl  including its cayman island subsidiary  ml cayman 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited rdl  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  and consolidated balance sheets as of march  and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in june  the fasb issued new accounting principles for variable interest entities vies which  among other things  established a qualitative approach for the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it has both the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of the vie or the right to receive the benefits of the vie 
these principles improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies and address constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions  including those in which the accounting and disclosures an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity  as well as address significant diversity in practice in the approaches and methodology used to calculate a vie s variability 
these new accounting principles related to vies were effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application was prohibited 
the company adopted the new accounting standard for vies effective april  with the deconsolidation of n t 
there was no impact on net assets or net income with the deconsolidation of n t  but prior year financial statements have been adjusted to conform with current year presentation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued new accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
these new standards establish the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements  including multiple revenue generating activities  and provide amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
these new accounting standards requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   which is the company s fiscal year 
early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available 
the company is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements  but the impact is not expected to be material on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of sensors and sensor based systems 
in order for revenue and related cost of sales from product sales to be recognized there must persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s standard terms are fob shipping point  but a small portion of our customers have fob destination terms 
based on the above criteria  revenue is recognized depending on the specific terms of the arrangement either at the point of shipment for those sales under fob shipping point terms or when it is received by the customer for sales under fob destination terms 
for those transactions that are shipped at or near the end of the reporting period for which the sales terms are fob destination  the company confirms receipt of the shipment  and if delivery has not occurred  then the revenue is not recognized 
product sales are recorded net of trade discounts at the point of sale including volume and early payment incentives because these allowances reflect a reduction in the price for the products  sales returns  value added tax and similar taxes 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales 
sales to customers generally include a right of return 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
sales returns have not historically been significant to our revenues and have been within the estimates made by management 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
many of our products are designed and engineered to meet customer specifications  and customer arrangements do not involve post installation or post sale testing and acceptance 
there is no significant variation in sales terms geographically  or among product lines and industries 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost under the first in  first out method 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
generally  products that have existed in inventory for months with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may be necessary for additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
cash flows from the purchase and sale of inventory are included in cash flows from operating activities 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the implied fair value approach or a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed and goodwill is not impaired 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting unit was determined using the implied fair value approach for fiscal years ended march  and  and for the year ended march   the fair value of the company s reporting unit was determined using the discounted cash flow method 
the implied fair value approach consists of comparing the company s market capitalization to the company s book value  and if the market capitalization exceeds book value  there is no impairment of goodwill 
based on our analyses and the applicable guidelines  there was no impairment of the company s goodwill at march    and acquisitions acquisitions are recorded as of the purchase date  and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates using various valuation approaches  including the relief from royalty method  cost approach and income approach  depending on the circumstances 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes in stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with standards for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using projected undiscounted cash flow at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
there were no indicators of potential impairment in as of march   there were no overall indicators of impairment  however  the company performed an impairment analysis for two european sites resulting in no impairment 
foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operating companies is the applicable local currency 
in consolidation  the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in foreign currency exchange in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
however  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany notes of a long term investment nature which management does not intend to repay in the foreseeable future are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
consideration of current and expected future taxable income of the company indicated that an overall valuation allowance is not needed 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
the company prepares various transfer pricing studies and other such procedures to assist in determining and supporting transfer pricing 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to re determine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
share based payment the company has five active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
since the company is currently in a net operating loss carry forward position  the company applies the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits are considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
the current year stock compensation deduction is used to offset taxable income before the nol carry forwards because all current year deductions take priority over nol carry forwards 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march analysis of consolidated statement of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated statement of operations in comparing fiscal to fiscal for further details regarding certain trends and expectations  please refer to the executive summary and trend sections earlier in item  management discussion and analysis of our form k

organic sales  defined as net sales excluding sales attributed to the psi acquisition of  increased  or 
sales increases were in all sensor product lines  with the largest increases in temperature  pressure and force 
the overall increase in sales is due to the improvement in overall global economic conditions  as well as new sales from broader product adoptions and new programs 
partially offsetting the increase in sales was a translation decrease in sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the average us dollar euro exchange rate had not changed during the twelve months ended march  as compared to the twelve months ended march   the company s net sales would have been higher by approximately  since a portion of the company s sales are denominated in euros and translated into us dollars  there can be a translation decrease or a translation increase in the company s net sales depending on changes in exchange rates 
the us dollar appreciated relative to the euro in comparing average exchange rates for the twelve months ended march  to the twelve months ended march  for example   is translated to  based on the twelve month average exchange rate ended march   but the same  is translated to  using twelve month average exchange rate ending march  the global recession in had been one of the worst recessions in decades  and the overall impact of the recession was evident during most of fiscal gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to approximately from approximately 
the increase in margin is mainly due to higher volumes of production and sales and the resulting improvement in leverage and overhead absorption 
as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to overall volume of business in that certain costs are fixed  and when volumes increase  our margins are higher 
additionally  margins were favorably impacted by improved product sales mix 
however  partially offsetting the increase in gross margins was the appreciation of the rmb  and the increase in china wages 
during fiscal  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar as compared to the corresponding period last year 
this translates to a decrease in profits of approximately based on an estimate decrease in our operating income of approximately for every appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar 
on a continuing basis  our gross margin may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability and cost of raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors 
selling  general and administrative overall  total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  or to  organic sg a costs  defined as total sg a excluding sg a costs associated with the psi acquisition of  increased  or

the decrease in total sg a as a percent of net sales is due to improved leverage with costs increasing at a lower rate than net sales 
non cash equity based compensation non cash equity based compensation increased or to  the increase in non cash equity based compensation  which is expected to continue next year  is mainly due to a higher grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model which is based on a number of variables  including share price  expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rate 
the higher fair value mainly reflects the increase in the company s share price 
total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs increased to  as compared to  last year 
the increase in amortization expense is mainly because of the psi acquisition  as well as the write off of in deferred financing costs associated with the previous credit facility  which was fully paid on june  amortization expense is generally higher during the first year after an acquisition because  among other things  the order back log is fully amortized during the initial year

foreign currency exchange gains and losses foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates with  among other things  the revaluation of balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies other than the business functional currency 
for example  our irish subsidiary  which uses the euro as its functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies  including the us dollar 
as the euro appreciates against the us dollar  the cash balances held in other denominations are devalued when stated in terms of euro  resulting in a foreign currency exchange loss 
the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange from a gain last year to a loss this year is mainly due to the revaluation of the us dollar denominated net asset position of the company s european and asian operations 
the company continues to be impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  including the impact of the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to the euro and swiss franc  as well as the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar

the company s effective tax rate for differs from the united states federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states 
no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities 
based on these reviews  the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
income tax expense increased  to  from last year 
the fluctuation is primarily due to the generation of higher profits before taxes during the current period and the generation of losses before taxes in certain tax jurisdictions during the corresponding period last year  as well as the impact of certain discrete tax adjustments 
the overall effective tax rate income tax expense divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately  as compared to less than last year 
there were a number of non cash discrete tax adjustments in resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately the discrete tax adjustments include the following the company recorded a reduction in income tax expense of approximately  with respect to the release of a valuation allowance on german deferred tax assets

diluted shares outstanding the average number of diluted shares outstanding increased  to  from  this increase primarily reflects the additional shares issued from the exercise stock option and the impact that the higher price of the company s stock has in calculating diluted shares outstanding  partially offset by the shares repurchased by the company 
the calculation of fully diluted shares outstanding under the treasury stock method includes the net of new shares potentially issued by unexercised in the money options and assumes the proceeds that the company would receive from the in the money option exercises would be used to repurchase common shares in the market

the global recession in was one of the worst recessions in decades 
the overall impact of the recession was not evident in the first half of fiscal  but became more apparent in the third quarter of fiscal decreases in fiscal sales were in all sectors  driven largely by sharp reductions in sales to passenger and non passenger vehicle customers in us  europe and asia 
sales bottomed out in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and began to stabilize during the first quarter of fiscal on a trailing quarter to quarter basis  sales increased each quarter during fiscal  but overall  quarterly organic sales have not yet reached pre recession levels

market indicators remained mixed  which lead us to believe global demand would not quickly recover  and it is not yet clear whether the recovery is sustainable 
gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to approximately from 
the decrease in margin was mainly due to lower organic sales and production volumes and the resulting decrease in leverage and overhead absorption  partially offset by certain cost control measures

since our overall level of organic business declined relative to the prior year  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
the decrease in production volumes not only reflects the decrease due to the alignment of production levels to match lower sales volumes  but also the consumption of inventory built up as part of the china facility move

additionally  organic sg a declined because of the decrease in organic sales  since a portion of our total sg a costs are variable and fluctuate with sales 
non cash equity based compensation non cash equity based compensation increased to  from  the increase in non cash equity based compensation was mainly due to the higher quantity of options granted and higher valuation of non cash equity based compensation

interest expense  net interest expense increased to  from  the increase in interest expense is primarily because prior year interest expense was lower since the company capitalized interest costs incurred on a portion of its debt during the construction of the china facility  and no such amounts were capitalized during the current year 
also contributing to the increase in interest expense was the increase in average interest rates 
average interest rates increased to about from the prior year 
average total outstanding debt was  restated in  as compared to an average amount outstanding of  in foreign currency exchange gain the increase in foreign currency exchange gain mainly reflects the increase in the gain associated with the changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  and the decrease in foreign currency exchange losses associated with the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
over the past few years  the company has had foreign currency exchange losses due to the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  but during  the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar remained relatively stable as compared to  and as such  there was a significant decrease in the related foreign currency exchange loss 
the higher foreign currency exchange gain was the result of the depreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the euro during the first part of fiscal the company continued to be impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  including the impact of the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to the rmb  euro and swiss franc

accordingly  our prices generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low

in connection with these acquisitions and divestitures  the company often provides representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters  commercial disputes  environmental matters or tax matters 
the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations  warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s second restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made  or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director  officer or employee of the company  or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director  officer or employee of any other entity  subject to limited exceptions 
the company s amended and restated by laws provide for similar indemnification rights 
in addition  the company intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with the company which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which the company will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding 
while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability  a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total other long term obligations on the company s balance sheet under gaap primarily consist of obligations under warranty polices  foreign currency contracts and tax liabilities 
the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management s estimate over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based on historical experience 
the above contractual obligation table excludes certain contractual obligations  such as earn outs related to acquisitions or possible severance payments to certain executives  since these contractual commitments are not accrued as liabilities at march  or otherwise indeterminable 
these contractual obligations are accrued as liabilities when the respective contingencies are determinable or achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity and credit risk  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company attempts to address its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities 
in addition  the company s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
interest rate risk under our term and revolving credit facilities  we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility loan accrue at a rate based on either a libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under the revolver credit facility at march   an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by interest on the principal amounts of our borrowings under our term loans accrue at fixed rates 
if interest rates decline  the company would not be able to benefit from the lower rates on our long term debt 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
commodity risk the company uses a wide range of commodities in our products  including steel  non ferrous metals and petroleum based products  as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our sensor products 
changes in the pricing of commodities directly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we attempt to pass increases in commodity costs to our customers  and we do not currently hedge such commodity price exposures 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments 
the company places cash and temporary investments with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations  it does periodically monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
in addition  concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company s customers 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and the company does not obtain collateral  insurance or other security 
notwithstanding these efforts  the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the company s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries  as well as from transactions in currencies other than the business functional currency 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a appreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at march  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates from transactions in currencies other than the business functional currency is reflected in foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
the company s primary transactional foreign currency exposures relate to the us dollar relative to the euro and rmb 
a appreciation of the euro and rmb relative to the us dollar for the company s net foreign currency exposures in those currencies at march   would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately and  respectively 
although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes  it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a large portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are priced in us dollars  and most of our costs and expenses are priced in us dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese rmb  euros and swiss francs 
sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the us dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
refer to item  business  foreign operations for details concerning annual net sales invoiced from our facilities within the us and outside of the us and as a percentage of total net sales for the last three years  as well as net assets and the related functional currencies 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar 
the rmb did not appreciate during fiscal  but appreciated by during the chinese government no longer pegs the rmb to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the rmb trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
the company has more expenses in rmb than sales ie  short rmb position  and as such  when the us dollar weakens relative to the rmb  our operating profits decrease 
based on our net exposure of rmb to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative operating income impact of approximately for every appreciation in rmb against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  forward purchase contracts  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the us dollar 
the company s french  irish and germany subsidiaries have more sales in euros than expenses in euros and the company s swiss subsidiary has more expenses in swiss francs than sales in swiss francs 
as such  if the us dollar weakens relative to the euro and swiss franc  our operating profits increase in france  ireland and germany but decline in switzerland 
based on the net exposures of euros and swiss francs to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive operating income impact of approximately and a negative income impact of approximately for every appreciation in the euro and swiss franc  respectively  relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
the company has entered into a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in china in an attempt to hedge the company s exposure to the rmb 
the rmb us dollar currency contracts have gross notional amounts totaling  with exercise dates through march at an average exchange rate of rmb to us dollar conversion rate 
with these rmb us dollar contracts  for every depreciation of the rmb or a appreciation of the rmb  the company would be exposed to an additional fx gains and losses  respectively  of approximately since these derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in their fair value are recorded in the results of operations  not in other comprehensive income 
to manage our exposure to potential foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase additional foreign currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices
