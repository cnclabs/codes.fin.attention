item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview on december   we completed a business combination with transave  inc  a privately held  nj based pharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated  innovative inhaled pharmaceuticals for the site specific treatment of serious lung infections 
under the terms of the merger agreement  insmed paid off all of transave million debt  and issued approximately million shares of insmed common stock  and approximately million shares of insmed series b conditional convertible preferred stock and cash consideration of  in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of transave 
of the million shares of series b conditional convertible preferred stock  million shares were retained by us as security for any indemnification payments required pursuant to the merger agreement 
on march  at a special meeting of our shareholders  all of our shares of series b conditional convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of our common stock  on a one for one basis 
also at this meeting  our shareholders approved a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock  which became effective at pm est on march  after giving effect to the merger and following conversion of the preferred stock into common stock  former transave stockholders have approximately a equity interest in the combined company  and insmed incorporated shareholders have a interest on a fully diluted  as exercised  basis 
the shares retained by us pursuant to the merger agreement approximately million shares of common stock after giving effect to the conversion of the series b conditional preferred stock and the one for reverse stock split of our common stock will be delivered on june   subject to reduction for any indemnification payments being made under the merger agreement 
we are a pharmaceutical company and following the december  merger  have expertise in proprietary  advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery 
our proprietary liposomal technology is designed specifically for delivery of pharmaceuticals to the lung and provides for potential improvements to the conventional inhalation methods of delivering drug to the pulmonary system 
these potential advantages include improvements in efficacy  safety and patient convenience 
our primary focus is orphan markets with high unmet medical needs which present a significant opportunity  as their challenge and complexity best fit our knowledge  know how and expertise 
the company s strategy is to utilize our patented advanced liposomal technology to develop safe and effective medicines that improve upon standards of care for those orphan respiratory diseases in which patient needs are currently unmet 
our initial primary target indications are pseudomonas lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients and non tuberculous mycobacteria lung infections 
research and development activities since we began operations in late  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of a number of product candidates 
until the sale of our fob platform on march   our research and development efforts were principally focused on pursuing a dual path strategy involving entry into the fob arena and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
our focus is now principally on our proprietary  advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery 
our initial priority is to conduct phase studies with patient accrual beginning in the second half of for arikace in treating cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections and patients with ntm lung infections all of our research and development expenditures  whether conducted by our own staff or by external scientists on our behalf and at our expense  are recorded as expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to develop and manufacture products and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
historically all of our research and development expenditures related to our proprietary protein platform were interrelated as they are all associated with drugs that modulate igf activity in the human body 
a significant finding in any one drug for a particular indication may provide benefits to our efforts across all of these products 
all of these products also share a substantial amount of our common fixed costs such as salaries  facility costs  utilities and maintenance 
given the small portion of research and development expenses that are historically related to products other than iplex we have determined that very limited benefits would be obtained from implementing cost tracking systems that would be necessary to allow for cost information on a product by product basis 
prospectively all of our currently planned r d activities are expected to be incurred in the development of arikace 
at present we expect research of arikace in the cf and ntm indications to represent our main research and development effort for our clinical trials with our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
for example  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may also be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates and particularly those that are in the preclinical or early clinical trial stage must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
some of these product candidates may never reach the clinical trial stage of research and development 
as preclinical studies and clinical trials progress  we may determine that collaborative relationships will be necessary to help us further develop or to commercialize our product candidates  but such relationships may be difficult or impossible to arrange 
our projects or intended projects may also be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and may require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding the period in which material net cash inflows from any of these projects is expected to become available 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal on march   at a special meeting  our shareholders approved a one for reverse stock split of our common stock  which became effective at pm est on march  this reverse stock split is reflected in the shares outstanding and earnings per share calculations throughout this k 
for the year ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction was primarily due to a year over year decrease of million in cost recovery from insmed iplex eap in europe  a million reduction in grant revenue related to the receipt of a million grant from the muscular dystrophy association and million in reduced royalties 
the causes of the fourth quarter revenue variance were also responsible for the full year differences in revenue between and net loss for the months ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net income of million  or per share  for the corresponding months of this million variance was due to the million after tax gain on the sale of the company fob assets to merck in  combined with a million decrease in total revenues 
these were partially offset by a million reduction in total expenses  a million increase in investment returns and a million decrease in interest expense 
the million decrease in total expenses was due to a million reduction in r d expenses  which was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the million reduction in r d expenses was due primarily to a decrease in manufacturing expenses following the sale of insmed fob assets in march  and was partially offset by the arikace related r d expenses incurred in december the million increase in sg a expenses was due largely to the increased finance  legal and consulting fees related to the strategic review and the business combination with transave on december  the improved return on investments reflected the increased cash position and higher yield rates  while the lower interest expense was due to the elimination of the debt discount amortization 
as of december   insmed had total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and certificate of deposits on hand of million  consisting of million in cash and short term investments and million in a certificate of deposit  as compared to million of cash on hand as of december  the million decrease in total cash was due to the million full payment of transave debt at the time of the merger  together with the payment of approximately million in costs primarily related to the strategic review during and the business combination with transave 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the months ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared to million in the months of consistent with fourth quarter results  the decrease was primarily attributable to a year over year decrease of million in cost recovery from our iplex eap in europe 
net income for the months ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the corresponding months of this million improvement was primarily due to the million after tax gain on sale of our fob assets to merck  combined with a million decrease in total expenses  a million improvement in investment returns  a million decrease in interest expense  and a million reduction in the realized loss on investments  which were partially offset by a million reduction in net revenue 
the million decrease in total expenses was due to an million reduction in r d expenses  which was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the million reduction in r d expenses was due primarily to a decrease in manufacturing expenses following the sale of our fob assets in march the million increase in sg a expenses was due largely to a combination of the recognition of stock compensation expense for the restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested on march   and the award of bonuses  together with the increased finance  legal and consulting fees related to the ongoing strategic review 
the improved return on investments reflected the increased cash position  the lower interest expense was again due to the reduction in debt discount amortization and the million reduction in investment loss was due to the write off of the napo investment  which occurred in as of december   insmed had total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and certificate of deposits on hand totaling million  consisting of million in cash and short term investments and million in a certificate of deposit  as compared to million of cash on hand as of december  the million increase in total cash was due to the million in before tax proceeds from the sale of insmed fob assets to merck  million from the conversion of warrants and options into common stock  the release of a million previously restricted certificate of deposit  and a million increase in unrealized gains on investments  which was partially offset by million utilized to fund operations and million for the partial repayment of the company convertible notes 
liquidity and capital resources there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point where fda approval for sales is received 
in our financial management  we have generally sought to raise the funds necessary for such development primarily through the issuance of equity securities in private and public placement transactions 
however  we may pursue additional financing options  including entering into agreements with collaborative partners in order to provide milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
we have funded our operations to date through public and private placements of debt and equity securities and the proceeds from the sale of our fob platform to merck 
we will continue to incur losses to the extent we expand our research and development and do not expect material revenues for at least the next several years 
furthermore  revenues from our eap in italy associated with cost recovery will be eliminated by approximately the third quarter of  when our current iplextm inventory is depleted 
at december   our cash and investments were approximately million  and were invested in money market instruments  treasuries  municipal bonds and mutual funds 
this is a decrease of million from december   primarily as a result of debt payment and transaction expenses associated with merger with transave  inc expenditures in fiscal were principally related in support of our eap  our ongoing strategic review process and the merger 
planned expenditures in include the funding of our phase trials of arikace  other ongoing research and development activity and general and administrative support costs 
on march   we completed the sale of our fob platform for an aggregate price of million 
after fees  taxes and other costs related to the transaction  we received net after tax proceeds of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
even though we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for the upcoming year  our business strategy in the future may require us to raise additional capital either through licensing  debt or equity sales 
in the future  we may require additional funds for the continued development of our potential product candidates or to pursue the license of complementary technologies 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when we need them or on favorable terms 
if at any time we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  restrict or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
we could  but have no plans to  enter into agreement with corporate partners in order to fund operations through milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
in particular  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts as set forth below payments due by years in thousands total beyond operating lease obligations critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policies discussed below are those we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for purchased in process research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture products  patent protection costs and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales when the goods are delivered and title passes to the customer 
at the time of sale  estimates for sales deductions  including rebates to government agencies  are recorded 
these provisions are provided for in the same period the related product sales are recorded 
following our settlement agreement with tercica now ipsen and genentech now roche on march   we ceased to supply iplex to patients and discontinued sales of iplex for short stature disorders as of march  revenue from our expanded access program in italy is recognized when the drugs have been provided to program patients and collectability is assured 
royalties that were paid to tercica and genentech are netted against expanded access program revenue 
license income is recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and payments are due 
grant revenue is recognized once payment has been received 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
currently  we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this option valuation model 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair valued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities and  at december   had million invested in money market instruments  treasuries  municipal bonds  mutual funds and a certificate of deposit account 
such investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk and are not insured by the federal government 
our policy of investing in highly rated securities whose liquidities at december   are all less than two years minimizes such risks 
in addition  while a hypothetical one percent per annum decrease in market interest rates would have reduced our interest income for fiscal  it would not have resulted in a loss of the principal and the decline in interest income would have been immaterial 
our purpose in making these investments is to generate investment income 
we currently do not transact any significant portion of our business in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that we continue to transact our business using the us dollar as our functional currency  we do not believe that the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
