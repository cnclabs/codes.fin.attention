item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain forward looking statements  which generally include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to our future economic performance and our current beliefs regarding revenues we might generate and profits we might earn if we are successful in implementing our business and growth strategies 
the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and its co products  the projected growth or contraction in the ethanol and co product markets in which we operate  our strategies for expanding  maintaining or contracting our presence in these markets  our ability to successfully manage and operate third party ethanol production facilities  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our current and future competitors 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  or in the case of a document incorporated by reference  as of the date of that document 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
any of the factors described immediately above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
overview we are the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states 
since our inception in  we have conducted ethanol marketing operations through our subsidiary  kinergy marketing  llc  or kinergy  through which we market and sell ethanol produced by third parties 
in  we began constructing the first of our four then wholly owned ethanol production facilities  or pacific ethanol plants  and were continuously engaged in plant construction until the fourth facility was completed in we funded  and until recently directly operated  the pacific ethanol plants through a subsidiary holding company and four other indirect subsidiaries  or plant owners 
in late and early  we idled production at three of the pacific ethanol plants due to adverse market conditions and lack of adequate working capital 
adverse market conditions and our financial constraints continued  resulting in an inability to meet our debt service requirements  and in may  the plant owners each filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code  or bankruptcy code  in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware  or bankruptcy court 
on march   the plant owners filed a joint plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court  which was structured in cooperation with a number of the plant owners secured lenders 
on june   or the effective date  the plant owners declared effective their amended joint plan of reorganization  or the plan  and emerged from bankruptcy 
under the plan  on the effective date  all of the ownership interests in the plant owners were transferred to a newly formed holding company  new pe holdco  llc  or new pe holdco  wholly owned as of that date by some of the prepetition lenders and new lenders of the plant owners 
as a result  the pacific ethanol plants are now wholly owned by new pe holdco 
on october   we raised million through the issuance of million in principal amount of senior convertible notes  or initial convertible notes  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  or initial warrants 
see liquidity and capital resources convertible notes 
on that same date we sold our interest in front range energy  llc  or front range  for million in cash  paid off our outstanding indebtedness to lyles united  llc and lyles mechanical co  or collectively lyles  in the aggregate amount of approximately million and purchased a ownership interest  which represents the single largest interest  in new pe holdco for an aggregate purchase price of million 
on january   we issued million in principal amount of senior convertible notes  or convertible notes  in exchange for the initial convertible notes and issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  or warrants  in exchange for the initial warrants 
see liquidity and capital resources convertible notes 
we currently manage the production of ethanol at the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of an asset management agreement with the plant owners 
we also market ethanol and its co products  including wet distillers grain  or wdg  produced by the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of separate marketing agreements with the plant owners whose facilities are operational 
we also market ethanol and its co products to other third parties  and provide transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol through third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  nevada  arizona  oregon  colorado  idaho and washington 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states and extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
our customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline 
we supply ethanol to our customers either from the pacific ethanol plants located within the regions we serve  or with ethanol procured in bulk from other producers 
in some cases  we have marketing agreements with ethanol producers to market all of the output of their facilities 
additionally  we have customers who purchase our co products for animal feed and other uses 
the pacific ethanol plants produce ethanol and its co products and are comprised of the four facilities described immediately below  three of which are currently operational 
if market conditions continue to improve  we may resume operations at the madera  california facility  subject to the approval of new pe holdco 
facility name facility location estimated annual capacity gallons current operating status magic valley burley  id operating columbia boardman  or operating stockton stockton  ca operating madera madera  ca idled under the asset management agreement and marketing agreements  we manage the production and operations of the pacific ethanol plants  market their ethanol and wdg and earn fees as follows ethanol marketing fees of approximately of the net sales price  corn procurement and handling fees of approximately per ton  wdg fees of approximately the greater of of the third party purchase price or per ton  and asset management fees of  per month for each operating facility and  per month for each idled facility 
we intend to maintain our position as the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states  in part by expanding our relationships with customers and third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol and by expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and transportation fuel 
further  we may seek to provide management services for other third party ethanol production facilities in the western united states 
financial performance summary our net sales increased by  or million  to million in from million in our net income increased by million to million in from a net loss of million in factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o higher sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by to million gallons in from million gallons in this increase in sales volume is primarily due to an increase in third party gallons sold  partially offset by decreased gallons sold from our ethanol production facilities 
in  gallons associated with front range were included in third party gallons sold  whereas in  those gallons were included in gallons sold from our ethanol production facilities due to our deconsolidation of front range in  as described below 
further  in  two of the four pacific ethanol plants were operating most of the year  whereas in  only one pacific ethanol plant was operating most of the year  and o higher ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol increased to per gallon in as compared to per gallon in gross margin 
our gross margin increased to negative for from negative for the improvement in gross margin was a result of higher ethanol prices and lower depreciation expense in  which were partially offset by an increase in corn costs 
depreciation was million for as compared to million for our average price of corn increased by to per bushel in from per bushel in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  decreased by million to million in as compared to million in primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees  sg a associated with front range  payroll and benefits  and other corporate expenses  which were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense and noncash compensation expense 
impairments 
we incurred no impairment charges for as compared to million for in  we recognized million in asset impairments primarily related to the pacific ethanol plants 
of the million in asset impairments  million related to impairment of the assets of our imperial valley facility prior to their disposal 
loss on investment in front range 
we sold our interest in front range in resulting in a loss of million 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
we extinguished certain outstanding debt in in exchange for shares of our common stock 
these transactions resulted in a loss of million 
gain from write off of liabilities 
we had no gain from the write off of liabilities for as compared to a gain of million in the gain in resulted from a write off of liabilities related to our imperial valley facility 
fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants 
we issued convertible notes and warrants in for million in cash 
these instruments are recorded at fair value  resulting in a charge of million in interest expense 
our interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to restructuring and removal of the plant owners prepetition debt as well as certain other indebtedness that was extinguished during other income expense 
our other income expense increased by million to million in from other expense of million in this increase is primarily due to a gain of million associated with our purchase of a ownership interest in new pe holdco 
reorganization costs 
our reorganization costs decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is due to the wind down in of the plant owners bankruptcy proceedings that began in gain from bankruptcy exit 
on june   the plant owners exited from bankruptcy  resulting in the removal of million in net liabilities from our balance sheet 
this amount was recorded as a gain in sales and margins over the past four years  our sales mix has shifted significantly 
we have generated sales by marketing ethanol produced by third parties and have also generated sales by producing our own ethanol 
our sales were initially generated solely through our marketing operations 
upon completion of the first of the pacific ethanol plants  our sales included substantial sales generated from producing our own ethanol 
we continue to generate sales through our marketing operations and also generate sales as a producer through our ownership interest in new pe holdco 
our production facility cost structure also changed throughout the past four years as the pacific ethanol plants were built and commenced operations  then later filed for bankruptcy protection  subsequently emerged from bankruptcy  and are now minority owned indirectly by us through our ownership interest in new pe holdco 
the shift in our sales mix greatly altered our dependency on certain market conditions from that based primarily on the market price of ethanol to that based significantly on the cost of corn  the principal input commodity for our production of ethanol 
accordingly  our profitability is dependent on the market price of ethanol and the cost of corn 
average ethanol sales prices increased in as compared to the average chicago board of trade  or cbot  ethanol price increased by to in from in the increase in the prevailing market price of ethanol was primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices in average corn prices also increased in as compared to specifically  the average cbot corn price increased by in as compared to the increase in the prevailing market price of corn was the primary cause of the increase in our average corn price 
the average cbot corn price increased to for from for we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and corn 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales and purchase commitments compared to the magnitude of our existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our ex posure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting in this capacity  we receive a predetermined service fee and have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
we believe that our gross profit margins primarily depend on five key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including tax incentives  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  the market price of wdg  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at the pacific ethanol plants to our sales of ethanol produced by unrelated third parties 
we seek to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and  when resources are available  implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address these factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our limited resources to act upon the anticipated factors described above and or our inability to anticipate these factors or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate these factors or favorable movements in these factors may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations accounting for the results of new pe holdco our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the plant owners for all periods except for the three months ended september  on june   the plant owners emerged from bankruptcy  and the ownership of the plant owners was transferred to new pe holdco 
accordingly  for the three months ended september   we did not consolidate the plant owners financial results as we had no ownership interest in the plant owners during the period 
also  under the plan  we removed the plant owners assets of million and liabilities of million from our balance sheet  resulting in a net gain of million for on october   we purchased a ownership interest in new pe holdco  which gave us the single largest equity position in new pe holdco 
bas ed on our ownership interest as well as our asset management and marketing agreements with new pe holdco  we determined that  beginning on october   we were the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco  and as such  we resumed consolidating its financial results with our financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of accounting for the results of front range effective january   we adopted the new guidance to financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   consolidations  which resulted in us concluding that  under the fasb s guidance  we were no longer the primary beneficiary of front range and  effective january   we prospectively adopted the guidance resulting in a deconsolidation of the financial results of front range 
upon deconsolidation  on january   we removed assets of million and liabilities of million from our consolidated balance sheet and recorded a cumulative debit adjustment to retained earnings of million 
the periods presented in this report prior to the effective date of the deconsolidation continue to incl ude related balances associated with our prior ownership interest in front range 
effective january   we began accounting for our investment in front range under the equity method  with equity earnings recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
on october   we sold our ownership interest in front range  resulting in a loss of million on the sale for  as we reduced the carrying value of our investment in front range to its fair value equal to the million sale price 
selected financial information the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance production gallons sold in millions third party gallons sold in millions total gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced

net sales the increase in our net sales for as compared to was primarily due to the increase in third party gallons sold and an increase in our average sales price per gallon  which were partially offset by a decrease in production gallons sold 
total volume of production gallons sold decreased by  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the decrease in production gallons sold is primarily due to our deconsolidation of front range for all of and the deconsolidation of the columbia and magic valley facilities for the three months ended september  third party gallons sold increased by  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the increase in third party gallons sold is primarily due to increased sales under our third party ethanol marketing arrangements  including gallons sold for front range for all of and gallons sold for the columbia and magic valley facilities for the three months ended september  our average sales price per gallon increased to for from an average sales price per gallon of for this increase in average sales price per gallon is also consistent with the average cbot price per gallon  which increased to for from for cost of goods sold and gross loss our gross loss improved to million for from million for primarily due to higher ethanol prices and lower depreciation expense 
our gross margin decreased to negative for as compared to negative for the improvement in gross margin resulted from higher ethanol prices and lower depreciation expense in  which were partially offset by an increase in corn costs 
at the end of  we recognized asset impairment charges  reducing our asset base and therefore reducing our future depreciation expenses 
total depreciation expense decline to million for from million for in addition  in  we included the gross profit of front range in our consolidated results  however these results are not included in our results 
these factors were partially offset by higher corn costs 
corn is the single largest component of the total cost of our ethanol production 
our average price of corn increased by to per bushel in from per bushel in we are eligible to participate in the california ethanol producer incentive program through the pacific ethanol plants located in california 
for the year ended december   we recorded million as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a decreased by million to million for as compared to million for sg a also decreased as a percentage of net sales due to relatively flat net sales 
the decrease in the amount of sg a is primarily due to the following factors professional fees decreased by million due to cost saving efforts and a reduction of million in professional fees associated with fewer debt restructuring efforts  sg a associated with front range decreased by million as we no longer consolidate front range s financial results  payroll and benefits decreased by million due to a reduction in the total number of employees as we reduced the number of administrative positions in in response to reduced ethanol production and related support needs  other general corporate expenses  including rent  decreased by million due to a reduction in office space and other cost saving efforts  and sg a associated with the pacific ethanol plants decreased by million as we did not consolidate their financial results with our own for the three months ended september  these decreases were partially offset by the following factors an increase in bad debt expense of million due to a significant recovery of a trade receivable in that did not recur in  and an increase in noncash compensation expense of million in due primarily to an increase in restricted stock grants to our employees and directors 
asset impairments our asset impairments were million in in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment  we performed an impairment analysis on our long lived assets  including our ethanol production facilities and assets associated with our suspended plant construction project in the imperial valley near calipatria  california  or the imperial project 
based on our probability weighted cash flows for our long lived assets  including the then current status of the plant owners restructuring efforts as they prepared to file a plan of reorganization  we determined that these assets must be assessed for impairment 
the assessments resulted in a noncash impairment charge of million  thereby initially reducing our property and equipment by t hat amount 
also in accordance with fasb asc  we assessed for impairment our assets associated with our imperial project  which resulted in an impairment charge of million in loss on investment in front range on september   we entered into an agreement to sell our entire interest in front range for million in cash 
the carrying value of our interest in front range prior to the sale was million 
as a result  we reduced our investment in front range to fair value  resulting in charge of million 
we closed the sale of our interest in front range on october  loss on extinguishments of debt we were party to agreements designed to satisfy our then outstanding debt to lyles 
under these agreements  we issued shares to a third party which acquired outstanding debt owed to lyles in successive tranches 
during  under the terms of these agreements  we issued an aggregate of million shares of common stock  resulting in an aggregate loss of million 
gain from write off of liabilities we sold the assets associated with the imperial project in the fourth quarter of the resulting cash proceeds and the settlement of the remaining liabilities were deemed out of our control as they had been assigned to a trustee 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining liabilities  resulting in a gain of million in fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants we issued senior convertible notes and warrants in for million in cash 
the senior convertible notes and warrants are recorded at fair value 
we recorded a charge of million related to the original issuance and subsequent fair value adjustments of these instruments 
the following reconciliation summarizes the initial amounts recognized for the issuance of the senior convertible notes and warrants and subsequent amounts that are recorded in the statements of operations as fair value adjustments to senior convertible notes and warrants in thousands balance sheet statements of operations convertible notes warrants fair value gain loss issuance of million on october  write off of issuance costs adjustments to fair value for the period ending balance  december  interest expense interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to the completion of the plant owners bankruptcy proceedings  resulting in reduced debt on their balance sheet 
in addition  other indebtedness owed to lyles was extinguished during  further reducing interest expense for as compared to other income expense  net other income expense increased by million to million in from other expense of million in the increase in other income expense is primarily due to a gain of million associated with our acquisition of a ownership interest in new pe holdco  as we paid for our ownership interest at a discount to the fair value of the net assets of new pe holdco 
reorganization costs and gain from bankruptcy exit in accordance with fasb asc  reorganizations  revenues  expenses  realized gains and losses  and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring of our business must be reported separately as reorganization items in the statements of operations 
we wrote off a portion of our unamortized deferred financing fees on the debt which was considered to be unlikely to be repaid 
during  the plant owners settled a prepetition accrued liability with a vendor  resulting in a realized gain 
professional fees directly related to the reorganization include fees associated with advisors to the plant owners  unsecured creditors  secured creditors and administrative costs in complying with reporting rules under the bankr uptcy code 
the plant owners reorganization costs consisted of the following in thousands december  professional fees write off of unamortized deferred financing fees settlement of accrued liability dip financing fees trustee fees total as of the effective date  we no longer owned the plant owners 
as a result  we removed the net liabilities from our consolidated financial statements  resulting in a net gain from bankruptcy exit of million 
net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities relate to the consolidated treatment of front range in and new pe holdco for the three months ended december   both of which are variable interest entities  and represent the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of these entities 
we consolidated their entire income statements for the applicable periods 
however  because we owned less than of each entity  we reduced our net income or increased our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which represents the remaining ownership interest that we do not own 
preferred stock dividends shares of our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred stock  are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series b preferred stock 
we have accrued dividends of million and million for and  respectively  resulting in total accrued and unpaid dividends of million in respect of our series b preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily from cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our convertible notes and warrants 
as of december   we had positive working capital of million 
as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
our current available capital resources consist of cash on hand and amounts available for borrowing under kinergy s credit facility 
we expect that our future available capital resources will consist primarily of our remaining cash balances  amounts available for borrowing  if any  under kinergy s credit facility  cash generated from kinergy s ethanol marketing business  fees paid under our asset management agreement relating to our operation of the pacific ethanol plants  distributions  if any  in respect of our ownership interest in new pe holdco  and the remaining proceeds of any future debt and or equity financings 
on june   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market  or nasdaq  indicating that the bid price of our common stock for the last consecutive trading days had closed below the minimum per share required for continued listing 
we were provided an initial period of calendar days  or until december   during which to regain compliance 
we failed to regain compliance by december  but  due to our transition from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market  we were provided a final additional period of calendar days  or until june   during which to regain compliance 
we may be unable to regain compliance with the closing bid price requirement by june  a delisting of our common stock is likely to reduce the liquidity of our common stock and may inhibit or preclude our ability to raise additional financing and may also materially and adversely impact our credit terms with our vendors 
see risk factors 
we believe that current and future available capital resources  revenues generated from operations  and other existing sources of liquidity  including our credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  we are unable to service the principal and or interest payments under the convertible notes through the issuance of shares of our common stock  if our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections  if unforeseen circumstances occur  or if we require a significant amount of cash to fund future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  could restrict our growth  or hinder our ability to compete 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  variance current assets current liabilities property and equipment  net notes payable  net of current portion cash used in operating activities working capital working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital increased from a deficit of million at december  to positive working capital million at december  as a result of an increase in current assets of million and a significant decrease in current liabilities of million 
current assets increased primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories  as two additional pacific ethanol plants were operating at the end of as compared to at december   only the columbia facility was operating  whereas  at december   the columbia  magic valley and stockton facilities were operating 
current liabilities decreased significantly primarily due to a significant reduction in current indebtedness which was extinguished during in connection with the plant owners emergence from bankruptcy  which was partially offset by our issuance of new indebtedness represented by the convertible notes 
cash used in our operating activities of million resulted primarily from our net income  net of an million reduction for noncash items  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in accounts payable  which were partially offset by a reduction of million in other net assets 
cash used in our investing activities of million resulted primarily from our million net purchase of our interest in new pe holdco  a million impact from our deconsolidation of front range  a million impact from the plant owners exit from bankruptcy and million in additions to property and equipment  which were partially offset by the million sale of our interest in front range 
cash provided by our financing activities of million resulted primarily from million in proceeds from the issuance and sale of our convertible notes and warrants  million in proceeds from our other borrowings  million in proceeds from our debtor in possession financing associated with the plant owners bankruptcy  which were partially offset by million in principal payments on related party indebtedness and million in debt issuance costs 
convertible notes on october   we raised million through the issuance and sale of million in principal amount of initial notes and initial warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
on january   under the terms of exchange agreements with the holders of the initial notes and initial warrants  we issued million in principal amount of convertible notes in exchange for the initial notes and issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for the initial warrants 
the transactions contemplated by the exchange agreements were entered into to  among other things  clarify previously ambiguous language in the initial notes and initial warrants  provide us with additional time to meet our registration obligations and to add additional flexibility to our ability to incur indebtedness subordinated to the convertible notes 
the convertible notes mature on january   subject to the right of the lenders to extend the date i if an event of default under the convertible notes has occurred and is continuing or any event shall have occurred and be continuing that with the passage of time and the failure to cure would result in an event of default under the convertible notes  and ii for a period of business days after the consummation of specific types of transactions involving a change of control 
the convertible notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  which is compounded monthly 
the interest rate will increase to per annum upon the occurrence of an event of default 
the holders of the convertible notes are entitled to interest  amortization payments and other amounts 
we are required to pay a late charge of on any amount of principal or other amounts due which are not paid when due 
interest on the convertible notes is payable in arrears on specified installment dates 
if a holder elects to convert or redeem all or any portion of a convertible note prior to the maturity date  all interest that would have accrued on the amount being converted or redeemed through the maturity date will also be payable 
if we elect to redeem all or any portion of a convertible note prior to the maturity date  all interest that would have accrued through the maturity date on the amount redeemed will also be payable 
we are obligated to make amortization payments with respect to the principal amount of each convertible note on each of the following dates  collectively  the installment dates i march   ii may   and iii the first trading day of each calendar month thereafter 
the amortizing portion of the principal of each convertible note  or monthly amortization amount  will equal the fraction of each convertible note  the numerator of which is equal to the original outstanding principal amount of the convertible note and the denominator of which is equal to the number of installment dates remaining until the maturity date 
we may elect to pay the monthly amortization amount and applicable interest in cash or shares of our common stock  at our election  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
all amounts due under the convertible notes are convertible at any time  in whole or in part  at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock at a specified conversion price  or conversion price 
the convertible notes were initially convertible into shares of our common stock at the initial conversion price of per share  or fixed conversion price 
the convertible notes are now convertible into shares of our common stock at a price determined as follows if we have elected to make an amortization payment in shares of common stock and the date of conversion occurs during the calendar day period following and including the applicable installment date  or initial period  the conversion price will equal the lesser of i the fixed conversion price  and ii the average of the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for each of the five lowest trading days during the trading day period immediately prior to the initial period 
if we have elected to make an amortization payment in shares of common stock and the date of conversion occurs during the period beginning on the th calendar day after the applicable installment date and ending on the day immediately prior to the next installment date or the maturity date  the conversion price will equal the lesser of i the fixed conversion price  and ii the closing bid price of our common stock on the trading date immediately before the date of conversion 
in addition  if an event of default has occurred and is continuing  the conversion price will be equal to the lesser of i the fixed conversion price  and ii the closing bid price of our common stock on the trading date immediately before the date of conversion 
the fixed conversion price is subject to full ratchet anti dilution adjustment where if we were to issue or are deemed to have issued specified securities at a price lower than the then applicable fixed conversion price  the fixed conversion price will immediately decline to equal the price at which we issued or are deemed to have issued the securities 
in addition  if we sell or issue any securities with floating conversion prices based on the market price of our common stock  the holder of a convertible note will have the right to substitute that floating conversion price for the fixed conversion price upon conversion of all or part of the convertible note 
we have agreed to pay buy in damages of the converting holder if we fail to timely deliver common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subject ive or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at the pacific ethanol plants 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products  though ultimately titled to us  in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which  depending upon the terms of the transactions  title to the product may technically pass to us  but the risks and rewards of inventory ownership remain with third party suppliers as we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions and therefore act predominantly in an agency capacity 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer and supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the vendor s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related  unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
when we act in an agency capacity  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined agency fees and any associated freight only  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
consolidation of variable interest entities we have determined that front range met the definition of a variable interest entity through our prior ownership interest in that entity 
since our initial acquisition of our ownership interest in front range through december   we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of front range and we were therefore required to treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes rather than use equity investment accounting treatment 
as a result  we consolidated the financial results of front range  including its entire balance sheet with the balance of the noncontrolling interest displayed as a component of equity  and its income statement after intercompany eliminations with an adjustment for the noncontrolling interest as net income loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity  through december effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance 
under the new guidance  we concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of front range 
as a result  effective january   we deconsolidated the financial results of front range 
our conclusion that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of front range was based upon our determination that we did not have the power to direct most of the activities that most significantly impact front range s economic performance 
some of those activities include efficient management and operations of its ethanol production facility  procurement of feedstock  sale of co products and implementation of risk management strategies 
on october   we acquired a ownership interest in new pe holdco 
we have determined that new pe holdco is a variable interest entity 
we also determined that we are the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco and therefore we are required to consolidate the results of new pe holdco in the same manner as we previously accounted for front range  as discussed above 
these determinations will be reviewed for appropriateness at each future reporting period 
convertible notes and warrants carried at fair value we have elected the fair value alternative for our convertible notes in order to simply our accounting and reporting 
we have also recorded our warrants issued in connection with our convertible notes at fair value 
we believe the valuation of the convertible notes and warrants is a critical accounting estimate because valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value the conversion feature 
changes in such estimates  and in particular certain of the inputs to the valuation  can be volatile from period to period and may markedly impact the total mark to market on the convertible notes and warrants recorded as fair value adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants of million for the year ended december  impairment of long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets have been primarily associated with the pacific ethanol plants  reflecting the original cost of construction  adjusted for any prior impairment 
we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of each asset or asset group could be less than the net book value of the asset or asset group 
we assess long lived assets for impairment by first determining the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows each asset or asset group is expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset or asset group 
if the amount of proceeds is less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group  we then determine the fair value of the asset or asset group 
an impai rment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  and the purchasing decisions of our customers 
we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
we recognized asset impairment charges associated with the pacific ethanol plants and our imperial project in the aggregate amount of million in we did not recognize any asset impairment charges in allowance for doubtful accounts we sell ethanol primarily to gasoline refining and distribution companies and sell wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk from sales of our ethanol as of december  and  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  those ethanol customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
we recognized a recovery of bad debt expense of million and million for and  respectively 
impact of new accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb amended its guidance to asc  consolidations  surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interest entities constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensur e that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
effective january   we adopted this guidance and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of front range 
as a result  effective january   we deconsolidated the financial results of front range from our own
