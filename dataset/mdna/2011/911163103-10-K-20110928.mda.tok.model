overview we believe we are the leading national distributor based on sales of natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products in the united states and canada and that our twenty eight distribution centers  representing approximately million square feet of warehouse space  provide us with the 
table of contents largest capacity of any north american based distributor in the natural  organic and specialty products industry 
we carry more than  high quality natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products  consisting of national brands  regional brands  private label and master distribution products  in six product categories grocery and general merchandise  produce  perishables and frozen foods  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition  bulk and food service products and personal care items 
we serve more than  customer locations primarily located across the united states and canada  the majority of which can be classified into one of the following categories independently owned natural products retailers  which include buying clubs  supernatural chains  which consist solely of whole foods market  conventional supermarkets  which include mass market chains  and other which includes foodservice and international customers outside of canada 
our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions 
these operating divisions are our wholesale division  which includes our broadline natural  organic and specialty distribution business in the united states  unfi canada  which is our natural  organic and specialty distribution business in canada  albert  which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and perishable items  and select nutrition  which distributes vitamins  minerals and supplements  our retail division  consisting of eom  which operates our twelve natural products retail stores within the united states  and our manufacturing division  consisting of woodstock farms manufacturing  which specializes in the importation  roasting  packaging and distribution of nuts  dried fruit  seeds  trail mixes  granola  natural and organic snack items  and confections  and our blue marble brands product lines 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the organic and natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our high quality service and a broader product selection  including specialty products  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural and specialty products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers  and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we have been the primary distributor to whole foods market  for more than years 
effective june   we amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market to extend the term of the agreement for an additional seven years 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we will continue to serve as the primary wholesale natural grocery distributor to whole foods market in its united states regions where we were serving as the primary distributor at the time of the amendment 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the agreement from september  to september  on july   we announced that we had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which we agreed to acquire certain assets of whole foods market distribution  inc previously used in their self distribution of non perishables  and have undertaken to become the primary distributor in their rocky mountain and southwest regions 
this transaction was completed in late september in the case of the southwest region and early october in the case of the rocky mountain region 
we paid approximately million in cash consideration to acquire the purchased assets 
following the closing of this transaction  we now serve as the primary distributor to whole foods market in all of its regions in the united states 
whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended july  and july   respectively 

table of contents in june  we acquired the sdg assets of sunopta through our wholly owned subsidiary  unfi canada for cash consideration of million 
with the acquisition  we became the largest distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods  including kosher foods  in canada 
this was a strategic acquisition as unfi canada provides us with an immediate platform for growth in the canadian market 
in november  we acquired two distribution centers located in massachusetts and arkansas which provide approximately million square feet of warehouse space 
we have now integrated specialty food products and natural and organic specialty non food items into our broadline distribution centers across the country 
we believe that this acquisition accelerated our expansion into a number of high growth business segments and established immediate market share in the fast growing specialty foods market 
due to our expansion into specialty foods  we were awarded new business with a number of conventional supermarkets during fiscal and  including our recently announced relationship with safeway 
we believe that distribution of these products enhances our conventional supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross selling 
on june   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with l r pursuant to which we have agreed to sell our conventional non foods and general merchandise lines of business  including certain inventory related to this business 
this divestiture will allow us to concentrate on our core business of the distribution of natural  organic  and specialty foods and products 
to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on time deliveries  centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce the geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities to achieve increasing operating efficiencies 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities 
we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately million square feet 
our  square foot distribution center in moreno valley  california commenced operations in september and serves our customers in southern california  arizona  southern nevada  southern utah  and hawaii 
our newly leased   square foot distribution center in york  pennsylvania  commenced operations in january  and replaced our new oxford  pennsylvania facility serving customers in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  ohio  virginia  and west virginia 
in april  we successfully relocated our former dhi specialty distribution facility in east brunswick  new jersey into the york  pennsylvania distribution center  creating our first fully integrated facility offering a full assortment of natural  organic  and specialty foods 
in september  we commenced operations of a new facility in charlotte  north carolina serving albert customers in north carolina  south carolina  georgia  tennessee and virginia 
in connection with the acquisition of the sdg assets in june  we 
table of contents acquired five distribution facilities which provided nationwide presence in canada with approximately  square feet of distribution space and the ability to serve all major markets in canada 
in september  we commenced operations at a new facility in lancaster  texas  shipping to customers throughout the southwestern united states  including texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana 
finally  in october we assumed the operations at the former whole foods market distribution facility in aurora  colorado 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural  organic and specialty products to retailers  adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us at our manufacturing subsidiary  woodstock farms manufacturing  for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment  offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies are i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses 
table of contents that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for workers compensation and automobile liabilities totaled million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
based on future expected cash flows  we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are at or one level below the operating segment level 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
during the first quarter of the fiscal year  we performed a test for goodwill impairment as a result of the expected change in future cash flows for certain of our branded product lines  and determined that no impairment existed 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
approximately of our goodwill is within our wholesale reporting unit 
for the wholesale reporting unit  the fair value was more than in excess of its carrying value 
the fair value of our remaining reporting units  including blue marble brands  woodstock farms manufacturing and eom were more than in excess of their carrying values  and are not considered at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
we feel that these projected results are achievable  though these assumptions are based upon our current business model and may be negatively affected if we attempt to dispose of any of our brands  stores or facilities or substantially change how we market and sell our products 
for all of our assessments  the weighted average cost of capital used in calculating the present value of future cash flows was 
total goodwill as of july  and july  was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired 
impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
as of our most recent annual impairment test  the fair value of our indefinite lived 
table of contents intangible assets was in excess of their carrying value 
the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to our branded product lines was more than in excess of its carrying value 
the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to our wholesale distribution business was also more than in excess of its carrying value 
the projections used in the impairment assessment for the branded product line asset group assume sales growth of approximately per year  with gross margin and operating expenses which on average approximate current levels as a percentage of sales 
the projections used in the impairment assessment for intangibles within the canadian wholesale distribution business asset group assume sales growth of approximately per year  with gross margin and operating expenses which on average approximate current levels as a percentage of sales 
total indefinite lived intangible assets as of july  and july  were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our finite lived intangibles are not recoverable during total finite lived intangible assets as of july  and july  were million and million  respectively 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved

table of contents fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  or million  to a record billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to growth in our wholesale segment of million  which includes the growth resulting from our entrance into the canadian market in june and the expansion of our primary distribution agreement with whole foods market in october our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and value added services  and the breadth of our product selection 
in addition  we believe that the integration of our specialty business has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  were also favorably impacted by moderate price inflation 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in sales from unfi canada  which includes the sdg assets acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and approximately million in incremental sales to whole foods market due to the acquisition of whole foods market southwest and rocky mountain distribution business in the first quarter of fiscal and our expanded distribution agreement in october our net sales by customer type for the years ended july  and july  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by approximately million  or during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  and therefore represent a lower percentage of our total net sales compared to the prior year 
whole foods market is our only supernatural chain customer  and net sales to whole foods market for the year ended july  increased by approximately million or over the prior year and accounted for approximately and of our total net sales for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
the increase in sales to whole foods market is primarily due to the increases in same store sales  as well as the expanded primary distribution agreement noted above 
net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended july  increased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in net sales to conventional supermarkets is primarily due to several large new customers won during the year based on our consolidated market strategy of natural  organic and specialty from one supplier  as well as million of net sales to conventional supermarkets by unfi canada 
with the addition of the safeway business that we anticipate we will begin servicing in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect 
table of contents that our sales to conventional supermarkets in fiscal will be a larger percentage of our total net sales than in fiscal other net sales  which include sales to foodservice and sales from the united states to countries other than canada  increased by approximately million or during the fiscal year ended july  over the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to of total net sales for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in sales percentage to the independent channel is the result of the higher growth rate in our supernatural chain as a result of an increase in whole foods market business  and in our conventional supermarkets 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  we began to see steady improvement in our net sales and a reduction in the volatility of net sales  as compared to what we experienced throughout our fiscal year 
as we continue to aggressively pursue new customers and as economic conditions continue to stabilize  we expect net sales for fiscal to further grow over fiscal in both our organic line and our specialty line 
we believe that this projected sales growth will come from both sales to new customers and an increase in the number of products that we sell to existing customers 
we also believe that food price inflation will contribute to our projected net sales growth in fiscal we expect that most of this sales growth will occur in our lower gross margin supernatural and conventional supermarket channels 
although sales to these customers typically generate lower gross margins than sales to customers within our independent retailer channel  they also typically carry a lower average cost to serve than sales to our independent customers 
we believe that the integration of our specialty business into our national platform has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business and will continue to allow us to pursue a broader array of customers as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended july  and for the year ended july  the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the change in the mix of net sales by channel that began during the second fiscal quarter of and start up costs related to inventory issues and incremental freight and service costs incurred during the first half of fiscal in connection with the initial period of operations of our new lancaster  texas distribution facility  partially offset by higher fuel surcharge revenue during the year ended july  our gross profits are generally higher on net sales to independently owned retailers and lower on net sales in the conventional supermarket and the supernatural channels 
for the year ended july  approximately million of our total net sales growth was from increased net sales in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels  while net sales growth from the independent and other channels was approximately million 
as a result  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal were to the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels compared to approximately in fiscal this change in sales mix from to resulted in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales during fiscal we anticipate net sales growth in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels will continue to outpace growth in the independent and other channels 
we expect that our expansion with whole foods market  both as a result of organic growth and as a result of becoming their primary distributor in their rocky mountain and southwest regions  and our opportunities in the conventional supermarket channel will continue to generate lower gross profit percentages than our historical rates  particularly during the time period when we are on boarding the new business and incurring costs of hiring and training additional associates and increasing inventory levels before the new customer has reached expected purchasing levels 
we will seek to fully offset 
table of contents these reductions in gross profit percentages by reducing our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily through improved efficiencies in our supply chain and improvements to our information technology infrastructure 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended july  was primarily due to higher sales volume including sales through our unfi canada subsidiary  million of labor and other expenses associated with the september opening of our lancaster  texas facility and incremental start up inefficiencies which continued through january  million for severance payments for former executives and million in restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with our ongoing divestiture of our conventional non foods and general merchandise lines of business 
unallocated corporate expenses have increased million during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july   primarily due to the continued development of a national platform across many functional areas including warehouse management  inbound logistics and category management 
total operating expenses for fiscal include share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in fiscal share based compensation expense for the years ended july  and july  includes approximately million and million  respectively  in expense related to the vesting of performance share based awards granted to our chief executive officer related to certain financial goals for those various periods ended july  and july  see note equity plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended july   from approximately for the year ended july  the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in the supernatural and conventional supermarket channels which in general have lower operating expenses  as well as expense control programs across all of our divisions 
we were able to manage our fuel costs despite rising prices by locking in the price of a portion of our expected fuel usage  updating and revising existing routes to reduce miles traveled  reducing idle times and other similar measures 
our expansion into lancaster  texas  where our new leased facility began servicing customers in late september  has helped to further reduce our fuel costs as a percentage of net sales as we are able to reduce the number of miles traveled to serve our customers in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana who were previously primarily served from our facility in denver  colorado 
these improvements in our operating expenses were offset in part by higher health insurance costs  higher workers compensation costs and the above described higher incentive compensation costs 
we expect that we will be able to continue to reduce our operating expenses as we continue the roll out of our supply chain initiatives including a national warehouse management and procurement system which was launched in the new lancaster  texas facility and is expected to be rolled out in all of our distribution centers by the end of operating income operating income increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in total 
table of contents operating expenses during fiscal  including the million recognized for restructuring and asset impairment expenses  compared to fiscal other expense income other expense income increased million to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  interest expense for the year ended july  decreased to million from million in the year ended july  the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average debt levels during the year as we used a portion of the million in proceeds from our secondary public offering completed in october to pay down our debt balances which had increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we financed our purchase of the sdg assets from sunopta with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with the expected purchase of the sdg assets  we entered into a forward contract to swap united states dollars for canadian dollars 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a gain of million  which was recorded in other income  upon settlement of the contract 
interest income for the year ended july  increased to million from million in the year ended july   primarily as a result of higher average cash balances during the year 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended july  is primarily due to increases in effective state tax rates 
our effective income tax rate in both fiscal years was also affected by share based compensation for incentive stock options and the timing of disqualifying dispositions of certain share based compensation awards 
certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes unless a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option and within two years of original grant 
we receive a tax benefit in the period that the disqualifying disposition occurs 
our effective income tax rate will continue to be effected by the tax impact related to incentive stock options and the timing of tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions 
in fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to 
net income reflecting the factors described in more detail above  net income increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share on a lower share base  for the year ended july  fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended august  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended august  this increase was primarily due to organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale distribution division of million 
our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and value added services  and the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in sales from our acquisition of unfi canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal our improvement in net sales also reflected year over year improvement in sales of our specialty products  which had been negatively affected by the difficult economic environment present throughout our fiscal year

certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes unless a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option and within two years of original grant
