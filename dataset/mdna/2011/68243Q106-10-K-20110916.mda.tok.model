as a provider of gifts to consumers and wholesalers for resale to consumers  the company is subject to changes in consumer confidence and the economic conditions that impact our customers 
demand for the company s products is affected by the financial health of our customers  which is influenced by macro economic issues such as unemployment  fuel and energy costs  weakness in the housing market and unavailability of consumer credit 
during the recent economic downturn  the demand for our products  compared to pre recessionary levels  has been adversely affected by the reduction in consumer spending 
anticipating continued economic pressure  during fiscal  the company took a more conservative view of the economy  and focused on achieving growth and enhancing its results through areas of the business over which it had more control 
throughout the year  the company saw improving trends in terms of revenue growth  gross margin and contribution margin 
revenue returned to growth in our fiscal third quarter  and continued into our fiscal fourth quarter  resulting in annual year over year growth 
this was achieved in a challenging environment through a merchandising strategy that focused on providing our customers with truly original products  the success of which can be seen in increased average order value and improved return on investment in marketing programs 
all of the above factors resulted in improved operating results 
reflecting the continued uncertainty in the consumer economy  the company does not anticipate significant improvements in consumer demand for discretionary purchases during fiscal with this in mind  the company plans to continue its strategy of focusing on areas of its business where it believes it can exert control and thereby affect enhanced results  including leveraging the company s operating cost structure  merchandising initiatives that emphasize truly original product designs and product line extensions  marketing programs that provide improved return on investment by engaging directly with customers to deepen our relationship with them  manufacturing and sourcing enhancements that can help mitigate commodity and shipping price increases and deliver increased gross profit margins  and  continuing investments for the future  particularly in social and mobile commerce initiatives  growing the baskets 
com business and expanded franchising opportunities in its fannie may and flowers brands 
for fiscal  the company expects to build on the positive trends that it has shown during fiscal  including increases in revenue  gross margin and contribution margin in its consumer floral business as well as continued top and bottom line growth in its bloomnet and gourmet food and gift baskets categories 
as a result  the company anticipates consolidated revenue growth for the full year in the low to mid single digit range as well as year over year increases in ebitda  eps and free cash flow 
category information the following table presents the contribution of net revenues  gross profit and category contribution margin from each of the company business categories  as well as consolidated ebitda and for fiscal and  adjusted ebitda earnings before interest including write off of deferred financing costs  taxes  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible impairment and severance and other restructuring costs

prior period results  which had previously been included within the flowers consumer floral category  have been reclassified accordingly 
corporate expenses consist of the company s enterprise shared service cost centers  and include  among other items  information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  legal  executive and customer service center functions  as well as share based compensation 
in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions  other than those of the customer service center  which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage  are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific category 
performance is measured based on category contribution margin or consolidated ebitda and for fiscal and  adjusted ebitda  reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the categories 
as such  management s measure of profitability for these categories does not include the effect of corporate overhead  described above  depreciation and amortization  other income net  nor does it include one time charges 
management utilizes ebitda  and adjusted financial information  as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization 
the company also uses ebitda and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
the company s credit agreement uses ebitda and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda and adjusted financial information is also used by the company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
ebitda and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  the company working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on the company debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company performance 
due to the company s strategic decision to divest its home children s gifts segment and classify it as discontinued operations  as well as other one time charges incurred during fiscal and goodwill and intangible impairment  deferred financing cost write off  severance and other restructuring costs  litigation settlement  and termination of marketing agreements  the following non gaap reconciliation table has been included within md a

during the fiscal year ended july  revenues increased by over the prior year period  as a result of growth across all categories  including almost growth within the consumer floral category  reversing the trend after two years of revenue declines  as well as continued growth in its bloomnet wire service and gourmet food and gift baskets categories 
during the fiscal year ended june   revenues decreased compared to the prior year period  primarily as a result of weakness in the retail economy which resulted in lower wholesale order volumes from designpac gifts  which is included within the company s gourmet food gift baskets category  combined with lower demand within the flowers consumer floral business  and from weakness in wholesale product sales within the bloomnet wireservice business 
fiscal was further impacted by the termination of the company s third party marketing program during the second quarter of fiscal the company fulfilled approximately million  million and million orders through its e commerce combined online and telephonic sales channel during fiscal  and  respectively  while average order value increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this shift reflects the change in the company s marketing and merchandising strategy which focused on innovative and original products designed to wow our customers gift recipients 
in comparison  during fiscal  the company relied more heavily on promotional pricing and markdowns  and free shipping offers promoted by the flowers brand during the fiscal key floral holidays in an effort to increase demand  in response to consumers preference for lower price point products 
other revenues increased during fiscal  in comparison to the prior year period primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales growth in the bloomnet wire service business  whereas other revenues during fiscal decreased in comparison to the prior year  primarily as a result of the decline in designpac and napco s wholesale order volume 
the flowers 
com consumer floral category includes the operations of the flowers brand which derives revenue from the sale of consumer floral products through its e commerce sales channels telephonic and online sales and company owned and operated retail floral stores  as well as royalties from its franchise operations 
in addition  during may  the company acquired selected assets of fine stationery  an e commerce retailer of personalized stationery  invitations and announcements 
while included in the operating results of the consumer floral category during fiscal  the operation of this acquisition did not have a material impact on results during fiscal net revenues for the consumer floral category during the fiscal year ended july  increased by over the prior year period as a result of continued strategic focus on i upgrading merchandising programs  ii re focusing the brand s marketing message  and iii enhancing the efficiency of its advertising spending 
these efforts resulted in improvements in revenues  gross margin and contribution margin 
during fiscal  net revenues decreased by over the prior year period as a result of lower order volumes due to soft consumer demand caused by the weakened economy 
fiscal revenue was negatively impacted by a combination of the sunday day placement and severe snow storms across much of the country during the valentine s day holiday  as well as the termination of the company s third party marketing program during the second quarter of fiscal after seeing improving revenue trends leading up to the fiscal valentine s day holiday  the company made the strategic decision to increase its marketing spending and offered customers a free shipping no service charge promotion in order to spur demand and accelerate the anticipated return to revenue growth with the brand 
although these programs resulted in an increase in order count and new customer acquisition  the lift in orders was insufficient to offset the associated decline in average order and gross margin  and combined with the increase in advertising spending required to support the promotion  resulted in significantly lower category contribution margin 
these negative trends continued  at a less dramatic rate  for mother s day and through the end of fiscal the bloomnet wire service category includes revenues from membership fees as well as other product and service offerings to florists 
net revenues during the fiscal year ended july  increased by over the prior year period  primarily as a result of growing revenues associated with increased shop to shop order volume 
while this order volume positively impacts revenues  at the present time  the impact on gross margin and contribution margin is significantly less than bloomnet s normal margin 
however  bloomnet expects to continue to monetize this increased order volume through increasing membership  technology  services and product fees 
net revenues during the fiscal year ended june  decreased by over the prior year period  primarily due to lower wholesale product sales from napco  as florists scaled back purchases as a result of the weakness in the retail economy

for fiscal  the company expects to build on the positive trends that it has shown in recent quarters  including increases in revenue in its consumer floral business as well as continued top and bottom line growth in its bloomnet and gourmet food and gift baskets categories

the increased gross profit during fiscal was attributable to sales mix  whereby higher margin e commerce sales growth within the baskets and cheryl s brands and retail store revenue growth by the fannie may brand  more than offset the impact of the loss of lower margin wholesale order volume from designpac  whereas the gross profit increase during fiscal was a result of improved gross margin performance  which offset the revenue decline primarily attributable to designpac 
during the fiscal year ended july   the gross margin percentage decreased by basis points  reflecting the above mentioned change in sales mix  as well as increased fuel and commodity prices  whereas  the gross margin percentage in fiscal increased basis points due to the reduction in lower margin designpac sales volume  as well as improved gross margins resulting from manufacturing efficiencies and reduced promotional pricing across all other businesses within the category

on january   the company completed the sale of these businesses  refer to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations for a further discussion

results for discontinued operations are as follows years ended july  change june  change june  in thousands net revenues from discontinued operations gross profit from discontinued operations operating loss from discontinued operations including losses on disposal of million and million during the years ended june  and june   respectively  and impairment charges of million during the year ended june  loss from discontinued operations the home children s gifts category includes revenues from plow hearth  wind weather  hearthsong and magic cabin brands 
revenue is derived from the sale of home decor and children s gifts through its e commerce sales channels telephonic and online sales and company owned and operated retail stores under the plow hearth brand 
during the fiscal year ended june   net revenues from discontinued operations decreased by over the prior year period as a result of lower e commerce sales volume due to the sale of the business on january   and therefore fiscal results only include sales through the date of disposition 
further contributing to the revenue decline was reduced consumer spending  particularly in the home d cor product category  and a planned reduction in catalog circulation  as well as lower retail store sales due to a store closure and a decline in customer traffic 
during the fiscal year ended june   net revenues from discontinued operations decreased by over the prior year period primarily as a result of lower order volume from the e commerce sales channel  due to a combination of reduced consumer spending  particularly in the home d cor product category  and a planned reduction in catalog circulation  including the elimination of the madison place and problem solvers catalog titles in fiscal further contributing to the revenue decline were lower retail store sales  compared to the same periods of the prior year  due to a decline in customer traffic

fiscal operating income loss includes approximately million of restructuring costs associated with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
during fiscal  the home and children s gift segment experienced significant declines in revenue and operating performance when compared to prior years and their strategic outlook 
the company believes that this weak performance was attributable to reduced consumer spending due to the overall weakness in the economy  and in particular  as a result of the continued decline in demand for home d cor products 
as a result of these factors  as well as the company s plans to resize this category based on the expectation of continued weakness in the home d cor retail sector  upon completion of the company s impairment analysis  the goodwill and intangibles related to this reporting unit were deemed to be fully impaired

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by e commerce operations from the company s online and telephonic sales channels as well as other operations retail wholesale and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
shipping terms are fob shipping point 
net revenues generated by the company s bloomnet wire service operations include membership fees as well as other products and service offerings to florists 
membership fees are recognized monthly in the period earned  and products sales are recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms of fob shipping point 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company performs an annual impairment test during its fiscal fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
based on its impairment test  the company reporting units had significant safety margins  representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired business is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
stock based compensation the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock price 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and future expectations 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the black scholes model also incorporates expected forfeiture rates  based on historical behavior 
determining these assumptions are subjective and complex  and therefore  a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of the company s stock options 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
it is the company s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
to the extent that the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and investment grade corporate and us government securities  as well as from outstanding debt 
as of july   the company s outstanding debt  including current maturities  approximated million 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes  but rather to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company manages its floating rate debt using interest rate swaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
in july  the company entered into a million notional amount swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate libor for a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement 
this swap matures on july  the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest libor payments 
the effective portion of the after tax fair value gains or losses on these swaps is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
exclusive of the impact of the company s interest rate swap agreement  each basis point change in interest rates would have had a corresponding effect on our interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis
