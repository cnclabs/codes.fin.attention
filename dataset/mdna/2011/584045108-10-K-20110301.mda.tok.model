the discussion and analysis below includes certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in risk factors and elsewhere in this report that could cause our actual future growth  results of operations  performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements herein 

table of contents overview we provide technology enabled products and services which together deliver solutions designed to improve operating margin and cash flow for hospitals  health systems and other ancillary healthcare providers 
our solutions are designed to efficiently analyze detailed information across the spectrum of revenue cycle and spend management processes 
our solutions integrate with existing operations and enterprise software systems of our customers and provide financial improvement with minimal upfront costs or capital expenditures 
our operations and customers are primarily located throughout the united states and to a lesser extent  canada 
medassets delivered solid financial performance in our full year results included total consolidated net revenue of million  a increase over these results were primarily driven by an increase in revenue cycle services  solid growth in revenue cycle technology tools  continued strong demand for medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services  and growth in net administrative fees from our gpo volume 
we reported a net loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share due to a significant amount of acquisition and integration costs associated with our recent broadlane acquisition and the impairment charges recorded during the year 
our adjusted ebitda amounted to million and was up over last year 
on november   we completed the acquisition of broadlane  the largest transaction in our company s history 
we believe medassets now has a much greater breadth of capabilities to help drive down total hospital costs by offering a leading group purchasing and supply chain cost management model that leverages data  analytics  consulting and outsourcing to drive clinical and operating effectiveness 
with the addition of broadlane s supply chain capabilities  we are confident that our business model and best practice solutions will provide our customer base the direction and support to effectively optimize revenue  secure reimbursement  reduce waste  aggressively manage total costs  and increase cash flow for healthcare providers as the slow economic recovery and impact of health insurance reform continue to impact their provision of care 
management s primary metrics to measure the consolidated financial performance of the business are net revenue  non gaap gross fees  non gaap revenue share obligation  non gaap adjusted ebitda  non gaap adjusted ebitda margin and non gaap diluted cash eps 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  our primary results of operations included the following fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  change change amount amount amount amount amount amount in millions in millions gross fees revenue share obligation total net revenue operating loss income net loss income adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin cash eps these are non gaap measures 
see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the broadlane acquisition  growth in our rcm segment from our comprehensive revenue cycle services and technology solutions  and 
table of contents growth in our scm segment from our medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services and our vendor administrative fees 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above offset by the following higher acquisition related expenses in connection with i acquisition and integration costs associated with our recent broadlane acquisition  and ii certain due diligence and acquisition related costs pursuant to an unsuccessful acquisition attempt  impairment charges primarily relating to i a write off of goodwill from our decision support services operating unit  and ii a certain scm trade name and a customer base intangible asset from prior acquisitions that were deemed to be impaired as part of the product and service offering integration associated with the broadlane acquisition  increased cost of revenue attributable to i a higher percentage of net revenue being derived from service based engagements within our rcm and scm segments  and ii higher direct costs relating to certain new and existing customer arrangements whereby the related revenue associated with these arrangements is contingent upon meeting financial performance targets 
the related revenue is proportionally recorded as the performance targets are achieved 
the increase in these types of arrangements was concentrated within our scm segment  higher operating expenses related to new and existing salary related compensation expense primarily associated with our expanding services based businesses  an increase in amortization expense of acquired intangibles  and an increase in depreciation expense from additions to property and equipment including purchased software in conjunction with fixed assets acquired in the broadlane acquisition 
for the fiscal year ending december   increases in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above  as well as lower expense growth due to certain management cost control initiatives and lower cash based incentive compensation expense during the year  partially offset by increased cost of revenue from segment revenue and product mix  including a shift to more service based revenue and increased corporate operating expenses 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the acquisition of accuro  growth in our rcm segment from our reimbursement technologies  revenue cycle services and decision support software  and growth in our scm segment from our technology solutions consulting services 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated operating income of million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above partially offset by the following increases in the amortization of acquired intangibles  increased share based compensation expense from our long term performance incentive plan  increased cost of revenue attributable to a higher percentage of net revenue being derived from service based engagements within our rcm and scm segments  and 
table of contents higher operating expenses  exclusive of those mentioned above  including legal expense  new employee compensation expense and bad debt expense partially mitigated by certain cost control initiatives 
for the fiscal year ending december   increases in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above  as well as lower expense growth due to certain management cost control initiatives and lower cash based incentive compensation expense during the year 
in addition  we had a reduction in certain discretionary expenses within our operating infrastructure including advertising and marketing costs as well as a higher percentage of our product development being capitalized during the year 
these factors contributing to an increase in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin were offset primarily by increased cost of revenue from segment revenue and product mix including a shift to more service based revenue and increased corporate operating expenses 
segment structure and revenue streams we deliver our solutions through two business segments  rcm and scm 
management s primary metrics to measure segment financial performance are net revenue  non gaap gross fees and segment adjusted ebitda 
all of our revenues are from external customers and inter segment revenues have been eliminated 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements herein for discussion on segment adjusted ebitda and certain items of our segment results of operations and financial position 
revenue cycle management our rcm segment provides a comprehensive suite of products and services spanning the hospital revenue cycle workflow from patient access and financial responsibility  charge capture and integrity  pricing analysis  claims processing and denials management  payor contract management  revenue recovery and accounts receivable services 
our workflow solutions  together with our data management  compliance and audit tools  increase revenue capture and cash collections  reduce accounts receivable balances and increase regulatory compliance 
our rcm segment revenue is listed under the caption other service fees on our consolidated statements of operations and consists of the following components  which are also discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements subscription and implementation fees 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis on multi year contracts for customer access to our saas based solutions 
we may also charge our customers non refundable upfront fees for implementation of our saas based services 
these non refundable upfront fees are earned over the subscription period or estimated customer relationship period  whichever is longer 
we defer costs related to implementation services and expense these costs in proportion to the revenue earned over the subscription period or customer relationship period  as applicable 
we are currently performing a study on our customer relationship period based on historical attrition rates 
this may result in an increase to the customer relationship period from approximately five to six years 
once the study is complete  this may have an impact on the related useful life used to amortize the deferred costs relating to implementation services 
this change would cause a decrease in the related amortization expense in future periods 
in addition  we defer upfront sales commissions related to subscription and implementation fees and expense these costs ratably over the related contract term 
transaction fees 
for certain of our revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees that vary based on the volume of customer transactions or enrolled members 
licensed software fees 
we earn license  implementation  maintenance and other software related service fees for our business intelligence  decision support and other software products 
these software revenues are typically recognized ratably over the contract period as these are effectively annual licenses 
we have certain rcm contracts that are sold in multiple element arrangements and include software products 
we have considered rule of regulation s x for these types of multiple element 
table of contents arrangements that include software products and determined the amount is below the threshold that would require separate disclosure on our consolidated statement of operations 
service fees 
for certain of our rcm solutions  we earn fees based on a percentage of cash remittances collected  fixed fee and cost plus consulting arrangements 
the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
beginning  january   our decision support services dss and performance analytics business operations will become part of our scm segment 
this move will help us capitalize on the integration of our products and services  and to focus on offering data driven tools and services to help bridge our customers clinical and financial gaps so they can produce the highest quality patient outcomes at the lowest cost 
we will include dss within our scm performance analytics offerings going forward 
spend and clinical resource management on november   we completed the acquisition of broadlane  a leading provider of group purchasing  supply chain outsourcing and centralized procurement services  capital equipment lifecycle management  clinical and lean process consulting  and clinical workforce optimization solutions 
with the addition of broadlane  our scm segment provides a comprehensive suite of cost management services and supply chain analytics and data capabilities that help our customers manage many of their high and low expense categories 
our solutions lower supply and medical device costs and help to improve clinical resource utilization by managing the procurement process through our strategic sourcing of supplies and purchased services  discounted pricing through our group purchasing organization s portfolio of contracts  consulting services and business analytics and intelligence tools 
our scm segment revenue consists of the following components administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
we earn administrative fees from manufacturers  distributors and other vendors collectively referred to as vendors of products and services with whom we have contracts under which our group purchasing organization customers may purchase products and services 
administrative fees represent a percentage  which we refer to as our administrative fee ratio  typically ranging from to of the purchases made by our group purchasing organization customers through contracts with our vendors 
our group purchasing organization customers make purchases  and receive shipments  directly from the vendors 
generally on a monthly or quarterly basis  vendors provide us with a report describing the purchases made by our customers through our group purchasing organization vendor contracts  including associated administrative fees 
we recognize revenue upon the receipt of these reports from vendors 
some customer contracts require that a portion of our administrative fees be contingent upon achieving certain financial improvements  such as lower supply costs  which we refer to as performance targets 
contingent administrative fees are not recognized as revenue until we receive customer acceptance on the achievement of those contractual performance targets 
prior to receiving customer acceptance of performance targets  we record contingent administrative fees as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
often  recognition of this revenue occurs in periods subsequent to the recognition of the associated costs 
should we fail to meet a performance target  we may be contractually obligated to refund some or all of the contingent fees 
additionally  in many cases  we are contractually obligated to pay a portion of the administrative fees to our hospital and health system customers 
typically this amount  which we refer to as our revenue share obligation  is calculated as a percentage of administrative fees earned on a particular customer s purchases from our vendors 
our total net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations is shown net of the revenue share obligation 

table of contents other service fees 
the following items are included as other service fees in our consolidated statement of operations consulting fees 
we consult with our customers regarding the costs and utilization of medical devices and ppi and the efficiency and quality of their key clinical service lines 
our consulting projects are typically fixed fee projects with an average duration of six to nine months  and the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
we generate revenue from consulting contracts that also include performance targets 
the performance targets generally relate to committed financial improvement to our customers from the use and implementation of initiatives that result from our consulting services 
performance targets are measured as our strategic initiatives are identified and implemented  and the financial improvement can be quantified by the customer 
in the event the performance targets are not achieved  we are obligated to refund or reduce a portion of our fees 
subscription fees 
we also offer technology enabled services that provide spend management analytics and data services to improve operational efficiency  reduce supply costs  and increase transparency across spend management processes 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly basis for these company hosted saas based solutions 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct labor costs incurred to generate our revenue 
direct labor costs consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and other direct costs and share based compensation expenses related to personnel who provide services to implement our solutions for our customers indirect labor costs for these personnel are included in general and administrative expenses 
as the majority of our services are generated internally  our costs to provide these services are primarily labor driven 
a less significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of costs of third party products and services and customer reimbursed out of pocket costs 
cost of revenue does not include certain expenses relating to hosting our services and providing support and related data center capacity which is included in general and administrative expenses  and allocated amounts for rent  depreciation  amortization or other indirect operating costs because we do not consider the inclusion of these items in cost of revenue relevant to our business 
however  cost of revenue does include the amortization for the cost of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of the accuro acquisition and related integration  there may be some re allocation of expenses primarily between cost of revenue and general and administrative expense resulting from the implementation of our accounting expense allocation policies that could affect period over period comparability 
in addition  any changes in revenue mix between our rcm and scm segments  including changes in revenue mix towards saas based revenue and consulting services  may cause significant fluctuations in our cost of revenue and have a favorable or unfavorable impact on operating income 
product development expenses 
product development expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense of the technology professionals who develop  support and maintain our software related products and services 
product development expenses are net of capitalized software development costs for both internal and external use 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing programs including trade shows and brand messaging  personnel related expenses for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense  certain meeting costs and travel related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for administrative employees and indirect time related to operational service based employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense and travel related expenses  occupancy and other indirect costs  insurance costs  professional fees  and other general overhead expenses 

table of contents acquisition and integration related expenses 
acquisition and integration related expenses consist of i costs incurred to complete acquisitions including due diligence  consulting and other related fees  ii integration and restructuring type costs relating to our completed acquisitions  and iii acquisition related fees associated with unsuccessful acquisition attempts 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of software  including capitalized costs of software developed for internal use 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets with the exception of software  primarily resulting from acquisitions 
key considerations certain significant items or events must be considered to better understand differences in our results of operations from period to period 
we believe that the following items or events have had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods discussed below or may have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods broadlane acquisition on september   we entered into a stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with broadlane holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company broadlane llc  and broadlane intermediate holdings  inc  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of broadlane llc broadlane holdings  pursuant to which  among other things  the company would acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of broadlane holdings from broadlane llc 
the broadlane group  inc  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of broadlane holdings  delivered supply chain management  strategic sourcing of supplies and services  capital equipment lifecycle management  advanced technology and analytics  clinical and lean process consulting and clinical workforce optimization 
the broadlane acquisition was consummated on november   and  in connection therewith  the company paid to broadlane llc preliminary purchase consideration of approximately million in cash plus working capital of million for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company will make an additional payment of approximately million in cash which represents the face value at maturity  subject to certain fixed adjustments eg  payments made by the company for working capital  inclusive of cash and certain limitations  on or before january  the purchase consideration paid at closing is subject to final modified working capital adjustment as defined by the purchase agreement 
the results of operations of broadlane are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
purchase accounting in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we recorded the following adjustment  which was determined as part of purchase accounting and recorded as part of the purchase price allocation administrative fee adjustment 
upon acquiring broadlane  we recorded a net million purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequent to that date through december  under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and record any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the purchase accounting adjustment amounted to an estimated million of accounts receivable relating to these 
table of contents administrative fees and an estimated million for the related revenue share obligation 
this change only impacted our scm segment 
credit facility and notes offering we were party to a credit agreement dated october   consisting of a senior secured term loan and a revolving line of credit that was administered by bank of america 
on november   in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with barclays bank plc and jp morgan securities llc collectively  the banks and closed a private placement offering of senior notes due the company used the borrowings from the credit agreement and the net proceeds from the offering of senior notes to finance the purchase price of the broadlane acquisition and repay outstanding indebtedness of the company and broadlane holdings

table of contents impairment of assets during and  certain of our assets were deemed to be impaired as they no longer provided future economic benefit 
such assets primarily included goodwill associated with our decision support services operating unit  certain acquired trade names  developed technology  and internally developed software 
in connection with our annual impairment testing  we recognized an impairment charge related to the goodwill at our decision support services operating unit within our rcm reporting segment 
we experienced a scheduled and planned step down in license fee revenue from a large business intelligence customer in our decision support services operating unit 
as part of our quarterly and annual forecasting process we expected to recover the revenue reduction related to this large customer with new customer wins 
however  given the economic environment and increased competition  conversion of new customer revenue has been lower than expected over the last six to eight quarters 
based on our lower sales conversion we revised our earnings forecast for future years for our decision support services operating unit 
as a result  we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling million and million during the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
cash based incentive compensation during and  we did not fund our discretionary bonus and incentive pool 
this decrease in compensation expense provided for a favorable impact on our operating expenses  net income and adjusted ebitda for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  termination of interest rate swaps in november  we terminated an interest rate swap as part of the broadlane acquisition that was originally set to terminate in march in consideration of the early termination  we paid the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the swap is no longer recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in june  we terminated two floating to fixed rate libor based interest rate swaps that were originally set to terminate july in consideration of the early terminations  we paid to the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the swaps are no longer recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december

total net revenue 
total net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in total net revenue was comprised of a million increase in rcm revenue and a million increase in scm revenue 
revenue cycle management revenue 
rcm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from net revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenue from our comprehensive revenue cycle service engagements including certain performance fees earned and a million increase in revenue from our revenue cycle technology tools 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue relating to our decision support services business primarily due to a scheduled and planned step down in license fees from a large business intelligence customer 
spend and clinical resource management net revenue 
scm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was the result of an increase in gross administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in revenue share obligation  and an increase in other service fees of million 
gross administrative fees 
non gaap gross administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  due to higher purchasing volumes by new and existing customers under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors as well as an increase in the average administrative fee percentage realized from our manufacturer and distributor contracts 
we may have fluctuations in our non gaap gross administrative fee revenue in future periods as the timing of vendor reporting and customer acknowledgement of achieved performance targets varies 
revenue share obligation 
non gaap revenue share obligation increased million  or  as compared to the prior period 
we analyze the impact of our non gaap revenue share obligation on our results of operations by calculating the ratio of non gaap revenue share obligation to non gaap gross administrative fees including administrative fees not subject to a variable revenue share obligation or the revenue share ratio 
our revenue share ratio was and for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in customers who are entitled to a higher revenue share percentage due to increased purchasing volume 
we did not have any significant change in our customer revenue mix during the year that resulted in a 
table of contents material impact on our revenue share ratio 
we may experience fluctuations in our revenue share ratio in the future because of the timing of vendor reporting and the timing of revenue recognition based on performance target achievement for certain customers 
broadlane related revenue 
the operating results of broadlane were included in our fiscal year ended december  for forty six days beginning with the closing of the broadlane acquisition on november  in  million of the net revenue increase was attributable to the broadlane acquisition  which was comprised of million in net administrative fee revenue and million in other service fee revenue 
as discussed further below  approximately million of estimated net administrative fees associated with the broadlane acquisition was excluded from our financial results because of gaap relating to business combinations 
given the significant impact of the broadlane acquisition on our scm segment  we believe acquisition affected measures are useful for the comparison of our year over year net revenue growth 
scm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from scm non gaap acquisition affected net revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the following table sets forth the reconciliation of scm non gaap acquisition affected net revenue to gaap net revenue fiscal year ended december  change amount amount amount unaudited  in thousands scm net revenue broadlane acquisition related adjustment broadlane purchase accounting revenue adjustment total acquisition affected net revenue these are non gaap measures 
see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
upon acquiring broadlane  we made a purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequent to that 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and record any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the million represents the net amount of i million in administrative fees based on vendor reporting received from the acquisition date up through december   and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million 
other service fees 
the million  or  increase in other service fees primarily related to million in higher revenues from medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services inclusive of broadlane 
the growth in supply chain consulting was mainly due to an increased number of engagements from new and existing customers coupled with other service fee revenue relating to consulting and sourcing services from the broadlane acquisition

the related revenue will be recorded once the performance targets are achieved and accepted by our customers 
excluding the impact of the broadlane acquisition  our cost of revenue as a percentage of related net revenue increased from to period over period 
this increase is primarily attributable to the reasons described above 
we may experience higher cost of revenue if i the revenue mix continues to shift towards rcm segment products and services and more specifically if the revenue mix within the rcm segment shifts towards more service related engagements  and ii we experience continued growth in our consulting services within the scm segment

critical accounting policy disclosure the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we find reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions 
management believes that the following accounting judgments and uncertainties are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when a there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the fee is fixed or determinable  c services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
inclusive in our revenue recognition policies  we are required to make certain critical judgments that impact the period over which revenue is recognized 
these judgments are described below 
subscription and implementation fees we apply the revenue recognition guidance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap relating to software for our hosted solutions 
we provide subscription based revenue cycle and spend and clinical management services through software tools accessed by our customers while the data is hosted and maintained on our servers 
in many arrangements  customers are charged set up fees for implementation and monthly subscription fees for access to these web based hosted services 
implementation fees are typically billed at the beginning of the arrangement and recognized as 
table of contents revenue over the greater of the subscription period or the estimated customer relationship period 
we estimate the customer relationship period based on historical customer retention rates 
we currently estimate our customer relationship period to be between four and five years for our hosted services 
revenue from monthly hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the customer uses the service 
contract subscription periods typically range from three to five years from execution 
we consistently monitor our customer relationship periods and as a result  our estimated customer relationship period may change due to the changing attrition rates of our customers 
we have historically changed our estimates of customer relationship periods for certain of our web hosted customers 
these changes in estimated customer lives have typically deferred revenue over longer periods 
we are currently performing a study of our customer relationship period and based on those results our customer relationship period may increase to a range of five to six years based on our updated historical estimated customer retention rates 
once finalized  we will utilize the updated estimate of our customer relationship period prospectively in recognizing revenue 
the impact of the potential change based on our current portfolio of applicable contracts would amount to a reduction in annual earnings of between million and million 
administrative fee adjustment upon acquiring broadlane  we recorded a net million purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequently 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and record any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the purchase accounting adjustment amounted to an estimated million of accounts receivable relating to these administrative fees and an estimated million of related revenue share obligation 
we will review the balances each reporting period as vendor reporting is received and payments are made and make any necessary adjustment 
the amounts are subject to change within the one year measurement period allowed by gaap 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers the following to be important factors that could trigger an impairment review and may result in an impairment charge significant and sustained underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  significant and sustained adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant negative changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses in accordance with gaap relating to goodwill and other intangibles 
this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires us to make market participant assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability and growth of future business strategies to determine estimated future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit or asset group using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  capital expenditures and cost of capital  similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of a reporting unit or asset group  and therefore can affect the amount of the impairment 
the following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections business projections 
we make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume  mix  and pricing 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors 
long term growth rate 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to the present value of the debt free cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 
discount rate 
when measuring possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 
weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk adjusted after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
economic projections 
assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry sales volumes and interest rates 
our estimates of future cash flows used in these valuations could differ from actual results 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
as of december   the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value  with the exception of our decision support services operating unit described above 
in addition  based on our sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical decrease applied to our assumed growth rates or a hypothetical increase applied to our weighted average cost of capital applied to our discounted cash flow 
table of contents analysis would not result in an impairment of our intangible assets nor would it cause us to further evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in addition  we make assumptions about the useful lives of our intangible assets 
intangible assets including our capitalized software are amortized over their useful lives  which have been derived based on an assessment of such factors as attrition  expected volume and economic benefit 
we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets on an annual basis 
any changes on our estimated useful lives could cause depreciation and amortization to increase or decrease 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we adopted revised gaap relating to business combinations as of january  the revised guidance retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and requires a number of changes to the previous guidance  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
other changes include requiring the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requiring the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requiring the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
our purchase price allocation methodology requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon appraised market values  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
management determines the fair value of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology or customer relationships  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies  and result in an impairment or a new allocation of purchase price 
given our history of acquisitions  we may allocate part of the purchase price of future acquisitions to contingent consideration as required by gaap for business combinations 
the fair value calculation of contingent consideration will involve a number of assumptions that are subjective in nature and which may differ significantly from actual results 
we may experience volatility in our earnings to some degree in future reporting periods as a result of these fair value measurements 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as whether a customer declares bankruptcy 
other factors include the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from customers 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may experience a higher or lower expense 
in addition  if circumstances related to specific customers change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
our bad debt expense to total net revenue ratio for the fiscal years ended december  and was and or and of other service fee revenue  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to the decline in uncollectible accounts and bankruptcies that occurred during the prior period and to improved internal processes to manage our accounts receivable exposure with respect to customers in our 
table of contents rcm segment 
however  as we continue to expand our services based non gpo revenue  we may experience a higher bad debt expense to total revenue ratio 
a hypothetical increase in bad debt expense would result in approximately million and million of additional bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  as needed  based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
our tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the forecasted amount and timing of future taxable income 
we estimate the company s effective tax rate based upon the currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment 
this rate is determined based upon location of company personnel  location of company assets and determination of sales on a jurisdictional basis 
we currently file income tax returns in approximately jurisdictions inclusive of certain city jurisdictions 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity when realized 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
if tax law does not specify the ordering in a particular circumstance  then a pro rata approach is used 
effective january   we adopted gaap relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
upon adoption of this guidance  our policy is to include interest and penalties in our provision for income taxes 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and certain state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
each quarter we assess our uncertain tax positions and adjust our reserve accordingly based on the most recent facts and circumstances 
if there is a significant change in the underlying facts and circumstances or applicable tax law modifications  we may be exposed to additional benefits or expense 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of uncertain tax positions in we expect a significant increase in our cash taxes in future years  primarily attributable to exhausting all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan  which includes non qualified stock options  non vested share awards and stock settled stock appreciation rights 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  
table of contents note  stockholders equity and note  share based compensation  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
prior to our initial public offering  valuing our share price as a privately held company was complex 
we used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with gaap for privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  in assessing and determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
the fair value of our common stock was determined through periodic valuations 
our stock valuations used a combination of the market comparable approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value of our company at each valuation date 
there was a high degree of subjectivity involved in using option pricing models and there was no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates resulting from these valuation models  nor was there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
for grants following the initial public offering  we utilized market based share prices of our common stock in the black scholes option pricing model to calculate fair value of our common stock option awards 
this valuation technique will continue to involve highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and estimated forfeitures 
it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  required by existing accounting requirements based solely on our own historical stock price volatility trading history  given our limited history as a publicly traded company 
once we have sufficient history as a public company  we will calculate the expected volatility of our share price based on our trading history  which may impact our future share based compensation 
in accordance with gaap for stock compensation  we have estimated grant date fair value of our shares using a combination of our own trading history and a volatility calculated calculated volatility from an appropriate industry sector index of comparable entities 
we identified similar public entities for which share and option price information was available  and considered the historical volatilities of those entities share prices in calculating volatility 
dividend payments were not assumed  as we did not anticipate paying a dividend at the dates in which the various option grants occurred during the year 
the risk free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for zero coupon treasury bonds over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of the awards represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
based on our limited history  we utilized the simplified method as prescribed in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate expected term 
for service based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using an accelerated method over the vesting or service period and is net of estimated forfeitures 
for performance based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using a straight line method over the vesting or performance period and is adjusted each reporting period in which a change in performance achievement is determined and is net of estimated forfeitures 
we granted certain equity awards under our long term performance incentive plan that included performance based stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and performance based restricted common stock 
the performance based ssars only vest upon the achievement of a compounded annual growth rate of diluted cash eps for the three year period ending december  the performance based restricted common stock awards vest in increments depending on the level of achievement in compounded annual growth rate of diluted cash eps for the three year period ending december  we assess the probability of achievement of the performance targets relating to these equity awards on a quarterly basis 
if during any reporting period under the related vesting term we conclude that we are unable to achieve the performance targets relating to these equity awards  we will reverse the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in prior periods 
this may amount to a significant change in our share based compensation expense in future periods if it is not probable that we will achieve these performance targets 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements involve payment of ordinary expenses  working capital fluctuations  debt service obligations and capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures typically consist of software purchases  
table of contents internal product development capitalization and computer hardware purchases 
historically  the acquisition of complementary businesses has resulted in a significant use of cash 
our principal sources of funds have primarily been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we believe we currently have adequate cash flow from operations  capital resources  available credit facilities and liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements including the following near term obligations next months i our working capital needs  ii our debt service obligations  iii our million deferred purchase payment relating to the broadlane acquisition due on or before january   iv planned capital expenditures for the remainder of the year  v our revenue share obligation and rebate payments  and vi estimated federal and state income tax payments 
in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with barclays bank plc and jp morgan securities llc 
the credit agreement consists of a six year million senior secured term loan facility and a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility that contains a letter of credit sub facility of million and a swing line sub facility of million 
also in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we closed the offering of an aggregate principal amount of million of senior notes due the notes in a private placement 
the notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the company s existing restricted subsidiaries and each of the company s future domestic restricted subsidiaries in each case that guarantees the company s obligations under the credit agreement 
the notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of november  the indenture among the company  its subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  na  as trustee 
pursuant to the indenture  the notes will mature on november  and bear annual interest 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  our expectation relating to the million deferred purchase payment will be to fund the payment by the due date from our free cash flow generated during the year 
if our free cash flow amount is insufficient  we expect to draw upon our existing revolving credit facility to fund any shortfall 
if we do not have enough liquidity to fund the deferred purchase payment with the combination of our free cash flow and revolving credit facility  we can obtain additional funding under are credit agreement via incremental loan facilities or an increase in the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility 
lastly  we have the option of an equity issuance to fund the deferred purchase payment 
historically  we have utilized federal net operating loss carryforwards for both regular and alternative minimum tax payment purposes 
consequently  our federal cash tax payments in past reporting periods have been minimal 
as of december   we have exhausted all of our federal net operating losses 
consequently  we expect our cash paid for taxes to increase significantly in future years 
we have not historically utilized borrowings available under our existing credit agreement to fund operations 
during september  we voluntarily changed our cash management practice to reduce our interest expense 
we instituted an auto borrowing plan which caused all excess cash on hand to be used to repay our swing line credit facility on a daily basis 
as we changed lenders in the course of the broadlane acquisition  this practice was suspended 
we are currently in discussions with our new lenders to institute a similar arrangement that will result in a comparable cash management structure and reduction in our interest expense 
as of december   we had zero dollars drawn on our revolving credit facility resulting in million of availability under our revolving credit facility inclusive of the swing line netted for a million letter of credit 
we may observe fluctuations in cash flows provided by operations from period to period 
certain events may cause us to draw additional amounts under our swing line or revolving facility and may include the following changes in working capital due to inconsistent timing of cash receipts and payments for major recurring items such as trade accounts payable  revenue share obligation  incentive compensation  changes in deferred revenue  and other various items  
table of contents transaction and integration related costs associated with the broadlane acquisition  acquisitions  and unforeseeable events or transactions 
we may continue to pursue other acquisitions or investments in the future 
we may also increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure  software solutions  and personnel  and as we expand our market presence 
cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund such expenditures 
accordingly  in addition to the use of our available revolving credit facility  we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds for such purposes 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters including higher interest costs  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be limited 
discussion of cash flow as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
operating activities 
the following table summarizes the cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended december  and year ended december  change amount amount amount in millions net loss income non cash items net changes in working capital net cash provided by operations net loss income represents the loss or profitability attained during the periods presented and is inclusive of certain non cash expenses 
these non cash expenses include depreciation for fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  stock compensation expense  bad debt expense  deferred income tax expense  excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  loss on sale of assets  impairment of intangibles and non cash interest expense 
refer to our consolidated statement of cash flows for details regarding of these non cash items 
the total for these non cash expenses was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in non cash expenses for the fiscal year ended december  compared to december  was primarily attributable to i a write off of goodwill associated with our decision support services operating unit and an impairment charge for property  equipment and intangibles primarily relating to the integration of product and service offerings associated with the broadlane acquisition  ii an increase in depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangibles primarily associated with the assets acquired in the broadlane acquisition  and iii an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs primarily associated with financing the broadlane acquisition and the write off of debt issuance costs from our previous credit facility

effective january   we adopted gaap relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the above amount relates to management s estimate of uncertain tax positions 
as a result of tax attributes net operating losses and tax credits  we have several tax periods open to examination until the statute of limitations has expired with respect to the year in which these attributes are utilized 
as such  we cannot predict the precise timing that this liability will be applied or utilized 
additionally  the liability may increase or decrease if management s estimate of uncertain tax positions changes when new information arises or changes in circumstances occur 
indemnification of product users 
we provide a limited indemnification to users of our products against any patent  copyright  or trade secret claims brought against them 
the duration of the indemnifications vary based upon the life of the specific individual agreements 
we have not had a material indemnification claim  and we do not believe we will have a material claim in the future 
as such  we have not recorded any liability for these indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a million letter of credit to guarantee our performance under the terms of a ten year lease agreement

use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board in its financial and operational decision making  we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures gross fees  gross administrative fees  revenue share obligation  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  acquisition affected net revenue and cash diluted earnings per share 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
we compensate for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
we provide reconciliations of non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures  where possible 
investors are encouraged to carefully review those reconciliations 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by us  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross fees  gross administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
gross fees include all gross administrative fees we receive pursuant to our vendor contracts and all other fees we receive from customers 
our revenue share obligation represents the portion of the gross administrative fees we are contractually obligated to share with certain of our gpo customers 
total net revenue a gaap measure reflects our gross fees net of our revenue share obligation 
these non gaap measures assist management and the board and 
table of contents may be helpful to investors in analyzing our growth in the spend management segment given that administrative fees constitute a material portion of our revenue and are paid to us by over  vendors contracted by our gpo  and that our revenue share obligation constitutes a significant outlay to certain of our gpo customers 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the overview and results of operations section of item ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
we define i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and other non recurring  non cash or non operating items  and iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we use ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance consistently over time as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges and amortization of debt issuance costs  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes  as well as other non cash purchase accounting adjustments  and imputed rental income and non recurring items  from our operational results 
adjusted ebitda also removes the impact of non cash share based compensation expense 
our board and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs  as well as for incentive compensation plans for employees generally 
additionally  research analysts  investment bankers and lenders may use these measures to assess our operating performance 
for example  our credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are  in part  based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and our board 
the principal difference is that the measurement of adjusted ebitda considered by our lenders under our credit agreement allows for certain adjustments eg  inclusion of interest income  franchise taxes and other non cash expenses  offset by the deduction of our capitalized lease payments for one of our office leases that result in a higher adjusted ebitda than the adjusted ebitda measure reviewed by our board and management and disclosed in our annual report on form k 
additionally  our credit agreement contains provisions that utilize other measures  such as excess cash flow  to measure liquidity 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and 
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  we encourage you to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
we also strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in this section  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to ebitda to adjusted ebitda are either i non cash items eg  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangibles and share based compensation expense or ii items that management does not consider in assessing our on going operating performance eg  income taxes  interest expense and expenses related to the cancellation of an interest rate swap 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance

the increase in is due to share based grants made under our long term performance incentive plan 
the increase in is due to share based grants made subsequent to our initial public offering 
we believe excluding this non cash expense allows us to compare our operating performance without regard to the impact of share based compensation expense  which varies from period to period based on the amount and timing of grants 
the imputed rental income recognized with respect to a capitalized building lease is deducted from net loss income due to its non cash nature 
we believe this income is not a useful measure of continuing operating performance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this rental income 
upon acquiring broadlane on november   we made certain purchase accounting adjustments that reflect the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november  but were reported to us subsequent to that 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and record any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the million represents the net amount of i million in administrative fees based on vendor reporting received from the acquisition date up through december   and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  these adjustments include the effect on revenue of adjusting acquired deferred revenue balances  net of any reduction in associated deferred costs  to fair value as of the respective acquisition dates for accuro and xactimed 
the reduction of the deferred revenue balances materially affects period to period financial performance comparability and revenue and earnings growth in future periods subsequent to the acquisition and is not indicative of changes in underlying results of operations 
the acquired deferred revenue balances were fully amortized in we may have this adjustment in future periods if we have any new acquisitions 
during  we terminated an interest rate swap as part of the broadlane acquisition that was originally set to terminate in march in consideration of the early termination  we paid the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  that termination amount is included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded an expense associated with the cancellation of our interest rate swap arrangements 
in connection with the cancellation  we paid the counterparty million in termination fees 
we believe such expense is infrequent in nature and is not indicative of continuing operating performance 
amount was attributable to million in transaction costs incurred not related to the financing to complete the broadlane acquisition such as due diligence  consulting and other relates fees  million for integration and restructuring type costs associated with the broadlane acquisition  such as severance  retention  certain performance related salary based compensation  and operating infrastructure costs  and million was attributable to acquisition related fees associated with an unsuccessful acquisition attempt 
we expect to continue to incur costs in future periods to fully integrate broadlane  including but not limited to the alignment of service offerings and the standardization of the legacy broadlane accounting policies to our existing accounting policies and procedures 
spend and clinical resource management acquisition affected net revenue 
spend management and clinical resource management acquisition affected net revenue includes the revenue of broadlane prior to the company s actual ownership 
the broadlane acquisition was consummated on november  this measure assumes the acquisition of broadlane occurred on january  spend management and clinical resource management acquisition affected net revenue is used by management and the board to better 
table of contents understand the extent of growth of the spend and clinical resource management segment 
given the significant impact that this transaction had on the company during the fiscal year ended december   we believe this measure may be useful and meaningful to investors in their analysis of such growth 
spend management and clinical resource management acquisition affected net revenue is presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our results of operations would have been if this transaction had occurred at the beginning of this measure also should not be considered representative of our future results of operations

reconciliations of revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue to its most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the results of operations section of item diluted cash earnings per share 
the company defines diluted cash eps as diluted earnings per share excluding non cash acquisition related intangible amortization  non recurring expense items on a tax adjusted basis and non cash tax adjusted shared based compensation expense 
diluted cash eps is not a measure of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and is not an alternative to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
diluted cash eps growth is used by the company as the financial performance metric that determines whether certain equity awards granted pursuant to the company s long term performance incentive plan will vest 
use of this measure for this purpose allows management and the board to analyze the company s operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non cash and non recurring items from our operations and reward organic growth and accretive business transactions 
as a significant portion of senior management s incentive based compensation is based on the achievement of certain diluted cash eps growth over time  investors may find such information useful  however  as a non gaap financial measure  diluted cash eps is not the sole measure of the company s financial performance and may not be the best measure for investors to gauge such performance

new accounting pronouncements business combinations in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update relating to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  which addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the update specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the 
table of contents current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the update addressed the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
the update also addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in the update significantly expand the disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with the objective of providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and how the application of the relative selling price method of determining stand alone value affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the accounting standards update is applicable for annual periods beginning after june   however  early adoption is permitted 
we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update relating to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the update will change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
among other things  tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance 
in addition  the update also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes tangible products and software 
the accounting standards update is applicable for annual periods beginning after june   however  early adoption is permitted 
we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new standards for vendors who apply the milestone method of revenue recognition to research and development arrangements 
these new standards apply to arrangements with payments that are contingent  at inception  upon achieving substantively uncertain future events or circumstances 
the guidance is applicable for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will impact our arrangements with one time or nonrecurring performance fees that are contingent upon achieving certain results 
historically  we have recognized these types of performance fees in the period the respective performance target has been met 
upon adoption of this guidance on january   these performance fees will be recognized proportionately over the contract term 
we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events in february  the fasb issued amended guidance on subsequent events 
under this amended guidance  sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements 
this guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements for the period ended march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
certain of our contracts are denominated in canadian dollars 
as our canadian sales have not historically been significant to our operations  we do not believe that changes in the 
table of contents canadian dollar relative to the us dollar will have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on august   we entered into a series of forward contracts to fix the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates on a canadian customer contract  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein  which expired on april  we have one other canadian dollar contract that we have not elected to hedge 
we currently do not transact any other business in any currency other than the us dollar 
as we continue to grow our operations  we may increase the amount of our sales to foreign customers 
although we do not expect foreign currency exchange risk to have a significant impact on our future operations  we will assess the risk on a case specific basis to determine whether any forward currency hedge instrument would be warranted 
interest rate risk 
we had outstanding borrowings on our term loan of million as of december  the term loan bears interest at libor  subject to a floor of plus an applicable margin 
we also had outstanding an aggregate principal amount on our notes of million as of december   which bears interest at per annum 
due to the additional indebtedness we incurred under the credit agreement and the notes we issued to help finance the broadlane acquisition  we expect to incur a significant increase in our interest expense in future periods 
to the extent we do not hedge it  we expect our interest rate risk to rise accordingly 
as required by our credit agreement  we expect to enter into one or more interest rate derivative instruments in the next three to four months convert a portion of our variable rate term loan facility to a fixed rate debt 
on may   we entered into a libor interest rate swap with a notional amount of million beginning june   which effectively converted a portion of our variable rate term loan credit facility to a fixed rate debt 
we terminated this interest rate swap in connection with the broadlane acquisition 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor  which would represent potential interest rate change exposure on our outstanding term loan  would have resulted in a million increase to our interest expense for the fiscal year ended december
