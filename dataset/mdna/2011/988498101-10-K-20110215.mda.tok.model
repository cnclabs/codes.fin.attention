us business transformation measures the us business transformation measures in  and included expansion of our us refranchising  a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term growth strategy  g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases 
we do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 
in the years ended december  and december   we recorded pre tax losses of million and million from refranchising in the us  respectively 
in the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax refranchising gain of million in the us the loss recorded in the year ended december  is the net result of gains from restaurants sold and non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us  principally a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants 
the non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants in the us  which were mostly recorded in the first quarter of  decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by million in the year ended december  this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item  resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charge being recorded for these restaurants 
the refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note and the store portfolio strategy section of the md a 
in connection with our g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs we recorded pre tax charges of million  million and million in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
we realized a million decline in our us g a expenses in the year ended december  driven by the us productivity initiatives and realignment of resource measures we took in and as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and a w us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding  we recorded a non cash charge of million in closures and impairment expenses  which resulted in no related income tax benefit  in the fourth quarter of to write off goodwill associated with these businesses 
additionally  the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of million  pre tax  in the year ended december   related to investments in our us brands 
these investments reflect our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken 
the reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship 
in the year ended december   the company recognized pre tax expense of million related to investments in our us brands in franchise and license expenses 
refranchising of equity markets outside the us in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our company operated restaurants  comprised of kfcs and pizza huts  to an existing latin american franchise partner 
the buyer will also serve as the master franchisee for mexico which had kfcs and pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction 
the write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit includes an insignificant amount of goodwill 
this loss did not result in any related income tax benefit and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
during the year ended december  we recognized a non cash million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market 
during the year ended december  we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in taiwan  which consisted of kfcs 
we included in our december  financial statements a non cash write off of million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan 
neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit  and neither loss was allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
the amount of goodwill write off was based on the relative fair values of the taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained 
the fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee  which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction 
the fair value of the taiwan business retained consists of expected  net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees  including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction 
we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising are substantially consistent with market 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of million  after the aforementioned write off  was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai  china on may  we acquired an additional ownership in the entity that operates more than kfcs in shanghai  china for million  increasing our ownership to 
prior to our acquisition of this additional interest  this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting 
concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition 
as required by gaap  we remeasured our previously held ownership in the entity  which had a recorded value of million at the date of acquisition at fair value and recognized a gain of million accordingly 
this gain  which resulted in no related income tax expense  was recorded in other income expense in our c onsolidated statements of income in and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
under the equity method of accounting  we previously reported our share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
subsequent to the date of the acquisition  we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statements of income 
we no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting 
net income attributable to our partner s ownership percentage is recorded as net income noncontrolling interest within our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december  the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by million  decreased franchise and license fees and income by million and positively impacted operating profit by million 
for the year ended december  the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by million  decreased franchise and license fees and income by million and positively impacted operating profit by million 
the impact on net income yum brands  inc was not significant to the years ended december  and december  sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan during the year ended december  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note for further discussion of this transaction 
this gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
russia acquisition on july   we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the co branded rostik s kfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states 
as a result  we acquired company ownership of restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of restaurants  which our partner previously managed as master franchisee 
upon exercise of our option  we paid cash of million  net of settlement of a long term note receivable of million  and assumed long term debt of million 
the remaining balance of the purchase price  anticipated to be million  will be paid in cash in july as a result of our preliminary purchase price allocation for this acquisition  our consolidated balance she et includes million of goodwill and million of identifiable intangibles at december  the impact of consolidating this business on all line items within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant for the year ended december  pizza hut south korea goodwill impairment as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our pizza hut south korea market we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for this market during this charge was recorded in closure and impairment income expenses in our consolidated statement of income and was allocated to our international division for performance reporting purposes 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about  down from its current level of 
this us target ownership percentage no longer considers the impact of ljs and a w restaurants  both of which are completely franchise operated  as we are pursuing a sale of these brands 
consistent with this strategy   and company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years e nded december   december  and december   respectively  and at december  we have offered for refranchising approximately kfcs in the us during  we also executed refranchising of all company owned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico restaurants and kfcs in taiwan restaurants 
refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of g a declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising gain loss  pre tax the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit  which reflects the decrease in company sales  and g a expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised 
the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
in these tables  decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year 
increased fr anchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year 
the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on total revenues as described above china division yri us worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues china division yri us worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on operating profit as described above china division yri us worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit china division yri us worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit internal revenue service proposed adjustment on june   the company received a revenue agent report rar from the internal revenue service the irs relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years through the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
the proposed adjustment would result in approximately million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately million 
furthermore  if the irs prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal the potential additional taxes for these later years  through  computed on a similar basis to the additional taxes  would be approximately million plus net interest to date of approximately million 
we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws  treasury regulations and relevant case law 
we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain  the company will continue to provide for its position in this matter based on the tax benefit that we believe is the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement of this issue 
there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
 additionally  if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue  such increases could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded 
the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 
taco bell beef issue in late january a lawsuit was filed alleging a violation of consumer protection statutes and deceptive business practices by taco bell through its advertising that the beef served in its products is seasoned beef 
though the company denies all claims within the lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position  the resulting negative publicity regarding its food quality has adversely impacted taco bell sales in both company and franchise stores 
while we do not anticipate a sustained negative impact on taco bell s sales  it is difficult for us to predict if there will be any significant impact on our revenues and operating profit given the recent nature of the adverse publicity 
sale of long john silver s and a w subsequent to the end of our fourth quarter  we decided to place our long john silver s and a w all american food restaurants brands for sale and began the process to identify a buyer 
in the first quarter of  we anticipate that we will recognize a non cash pre tax impairment loss in special items as a result of our decision to sell 
the amount of the expected pre tax loss as well as the related tax impact will be dependent upon indications we receive as to potential sales prices and structures 
we do not expect the eventual sale to have a material impact to our ongoing earnings or cash flows

as licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units  we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information 
b during the second quarter of we acquired additional ownership in and began consolidating an entity that operates the kfc business in shanghai  china and have reclassified the units accordingly 
this entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate 
c the ending balances for and the activity for for the international division and china division have been restated to reflect a change in our management reporting structure 
the international division ending balances for and now include and company units  respectively and and franchisee units  respectively  in thailand and kfc taiwan with the offset to the china division ending balances 
multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above 
multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count 
similarly  a new multibrand restaurant  while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands  results in just one additional unit count

interest expense  net decreased million or in this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a decrease in borrowings in as compared to income taxes the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below us federal statutory rate state income tax  net of federal tax benefit statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations adjustments to reserves and prior years change in valuation allowance other  net effective income tax rate statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations 
this item includes local taxes  withholding taxes  and shareholder level taxes  net of foreign tax credits 
the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 
in  the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings 
in  the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year 
in  the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by tax planning actions implemented in percentage points 
in addition  the benefit was also favorably impacted by a decrease in tax expense for certain foreign markets 
adjustments to reserves and prior years 
this item includes the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns  including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets  and changes in tax reserves  including interest thereon  established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome 
the impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the s tatutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line 
in  this item included a net increase in tax expense driven by the reversal of foreign tax credits for prior years that are not likely to be claimed on future tax returns 
in  this item included out of year adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate by percentage points 
in  this item included out of year adjustments which increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
change in valuation allowance 
this item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 
the impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line 
in  the million of net tax expense was driven by million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year 
this expense was partially offset by a million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of us state deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 
in  the million net tax benefit was driven by million of benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 
this benefit was partially offset by million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year 
in  the million net tax expense was primarily due to million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year  including a full valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated by tax planning actions as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized in the future 
this increase was partially offset by million of benefits primarily resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year 
other 
this item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings and us tax credits 
in  this item was positively impacted by a one time pre tax gain of approximately million  with no related income tax expense  recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in  and consolidation of  the entity that operates kfc in shanghai  china 
this was partially offset by a pre tax us goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  with no related income tax benefit 
consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million compared to  million in the increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items and decreased pension contributions 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was  million compared to  million in the decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions  partially offset by higher operating profit before special items 
net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the decrease was driven by lapping the acquisition of an interest in little sheep  as discussed in note  and increased proceeds from refranchising  partially offset by the acquisition of our partner s interest in rostik s kfc 
see note for further discussion 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in little sheep  lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property  plant and equipment  partially offset by lower capital spending 
in december  we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for million includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 
the international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close 
thus  consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period  the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of million was recorded in the first quarter of however  the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december and were thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the decrease was driven by higher net borrowings  partially offset by an increase in share repurchases 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million versus  million in the decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases  partially offset by net payments on debt 
consolidated financial condition the increase in short term borrowings was primarily due to the classification of million in senior unsecured notes as short term borrowings due to the april maturity date 
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment 
net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion in each of the last nine fiscal years  including nearly billion in we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
however  unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns  we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
additionally  as of december  we had approximately billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in  primarily related to a domestic facility 
during the third quarter of  we issued million aggregate principal amount of year senior unsecured notes due to the favorable credit markets 
as a result of issuing the senior unsecured notes as well as our continued strong cash flows from operating activities  we have cash and cash equivalents at december  that are higher than our historical levels 
our cash equivalents are temporarily invested in short term investment grade securities with maturities of three months or less 
we anticipate using a significant amount of these cash and cash equivalents when million in senior unsecured notes come due in april our china division and yri represented more than of the company s operating profit in excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development 
to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending  including share repurchases  dividends and debt repayments  we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner 
as a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of investments in foreign subsidiaries are essentially permanent in duration as of december  if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 
we currently have investment grade ratings from standard poor s rating services bbb and moody s investors service baa 
while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating  a downgrade would increase the company s current borrowing costs and could impact the company s ability to access the credit markets if necessary 
based on the amount and composition of our debt at december   which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities  our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in capital spending  including approximately million in the us  million for the international division and million for the china division 
for  we estimate capital spending will be approximately million 
during the year ended december   we repurchased shares for million  which includes the effect of million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the fiscal year 
in march  our board of directors authorized share repurchases through march of up to million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock 
at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the march authorization 
additionally  on january   our board of directors authorized share repurchases through july of up to million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of of net income 
borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in november and includes participating banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or is determined by an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
we also have a million  syndicated revolving credit facility the international credit facility  or icf which matures in november and includes banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
there was available credit of million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum 
these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
given the company s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december  with a considerable amount of cushion 
the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and stated interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  including million in senior unsecured notes due in april both the credit facility and the icf contain cross default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million  or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness  will constitute a default under such agreement 
our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled  or such indebtedness is not discharged  within days after notice 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other d total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the libor forward yield curve 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to more than  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
d other consists of pension plan funding obligations and projected payments for deferred compensation 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees  the most significant of which are in the us and us the most significant of these plans  the yum retirement plan the plan  is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred 
our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan s funded status 
at december   the plan was in a net underfunded position of million 
the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded positi on of million at our measurement date 
based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans  we will not be required to make significant contributions in investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption 
future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond our post retirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made post retirement benefit payments of million in and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table 
see note for further details about our pension and post retirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreed to provide financial support  if required  to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs 
as part of this agreement  we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately million and two letters of credit totaling approximately million in support of the franchisee loan program at december  one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee 
the other letter of credit could be used  in certain circumstances  to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program 
the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were mil lion with an additional million available for lending at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately million and million of debt outstanding as of december  and december   respectively 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidelines and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis for level fair value measurements 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the company 
these new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance that requires new disclosures about an entity s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables 
existing disclosures are amended to require an entity to provide certain disclosures on a disaggregated basis by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivables 
the new disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  and have been complied with in this form k 
the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets of restaurants primarily pp e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating semi annually for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant s forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
for restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable  we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value 
key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after tax cash flows of the restaurant and discount rate 
 the after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer  if available  or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows for the group of restaurants 
the after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets 
historically  these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets 
the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
these definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted after tax cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property  plant and equipment 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us  our yri business units typically individual countries and our china division brands 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit 
we bel ieve the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
however  our pizza hut united kingdom uk reporting unit  for which million in goodwill was recorded at year end  has experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past several years as sales and profits have declined 
our forecasts of future cash flows in determining the fair value of this reporting unit incorporate plans that have been put into place to return the business to previous levels of profitability 
these plans include specific measures to drive system sales growth  which is the assumption that most significantly drives the cash flow expectations and resulting fair value estimations of the reporting unit  over the next three years 
while such forecasted system sales growth is higher than what we would normally anticipate for a mature market like pizza hut uk  such growth is reflective of our belief that the business has experienced a temporary downturn and that sales declines in recent years can be recovered 
if our plans to drive system sales growth are not achieved or are not expected to be achieved  this could impact future estimations of fair value of the pizza hut uk reporting unit and result in impairment of some or all of the pizza hut uk recorded goodwill 
likewise  if other events  such as higher than anticipated inflation that we were unable to recover through increased sales  were to occur that would negatively impact the outlook for the business and our resulting estimations of fair value  some or all of the goodwill could be impaired 
when we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained 
the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee  which include a deduction for the anticipated  future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 
appropriate adjustments are made if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates 
w hen determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world 
the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company 
the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising 
others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 
during  the company s reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our taiwan business unit and our pizza hut us operating segment 
within our taiwan business unit  restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
within our pizza hut us operating segment  restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables guarantees franchise and license receivable balances include royalties  initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services 
our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december  as such  we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december  we have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants  facilitating franchisee development and equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification  such as renewals  when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 
the potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated  with approximately million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
additionally  we have guaranteed approximately million of franchisee loans for various equipment programs 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guara ntees and  historically  we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees 
if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable 
if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of  million and a fair value of plan assets of million at december  the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at december  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
we excluded from the model tho se corporate debt instruments flagged by moody s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately million to million in the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets  for purposes of determining pension expense  at december  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our us pension plans expense by approximately million 
the losses our us plan assets have experienced  along with a decrease in discount rates over time  have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule 
we reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
based on the results of this analysis  we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives  respectively 
upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated pre vesting forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income taxes at december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of million  as well as our other deferred tax assets  to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage  including approximately million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strat egies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately ad justed for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
additionally  we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis  totaling approximately billion at december   as we believe the excess is essentially permanent in duration 
if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances  deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact income taxes 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute more than of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and ca sh flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased approximately million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is mini mized 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors
