overview we design  develop  manufacture and market aesthetic energy devices to address a range of skin issues brought on by the effects of aging  environmental factors or hormonal changes 
our patented and fda cleared systems use radiofrequency  or rf  energy to heat and shrink collagen and tighten tissue while simultaneously cooling and protecting the surface of the skin 
laser devices used for aesthetic procedures  such as skin resurfacing  are generally regulated as class ii medical devices  requiring k clearance 
the fda has granted fourteen k clearances for four fraxel devices relating to multiple indications for use 
the acquisition of aesthera corporation aesthera has added intense pulsed light  which we sometimes refer to as ipl  devices to our product portfolio 
in april  aesthera received fda clearance to market its first ipl system for the treatment of benign vascular and pigmented lesions  and permanent hair reduction 
in september  the aesthera ppx system received fda clearance for the treatment of benign vascular and pigmented lesions  permanent hair reduction  and the additional indication of treatment of mild to moderate acne 
the isolaz system received fda clearance in january for the treatment of benign vascular and pigmented lesions  permanent hair reduction  and mild to moderate acne 
the acquisition of clrs technology corporation clrs also added an ipl personal care acne treatment system 
in april  the claro product was the first ipl acne treatment system to secure fda over the counter clearance for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne 
as of december   we had a global installed base of over  systems 
net revenue for the year ended december  increased or million  to million  from million in  mainly from higher tip revenue  an increase in upgrade and net system sales and the million contribution from aesthera products under the isolaz brand name  partially offset by a decrease in handpeice sales 
our business continued to be impacted by the weakness in global economic conditions and tightening of the credit markets  which resulted in a slowdown in customer purchase decisions 
as our procedures are generally elective  the slowing economy reduced demand for our procedures 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
in response to the continuing difficulties in the economy  we have implemented a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include fraxel consumables as well as offering incentives to doctors who become fraxel  thermage and isolaz customers 

table of contents acquisition of clrs technology corporation on october   we acquired of the common stock of clrs technology corporation clrs  a privately held company for consideration consisting of the payment of approximately million of debt at the closing of the acquisition 
in connection with this transaction  the company entered into a contingent consideration arrangement which may require payments if certain milestones related to revenue from the sale of clrs products and operating income of clrs are achieved during the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach 
key assumptions include i a discount rate of and percent and ii probability of milestone achievement ranging from 
as of december  the fair value of the contingent consideration had not changed 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has expanded its product offerings by providing a consumer based treatment of acne to its customers through a retail channel 
of the total original purchase price of million  million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets  which are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of four to six years 
the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income approach and the cost method approach 
the income approach uses a discounted cash flow model 
the company calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangibles using a discount rate 
with respect to intangible assets  there are several methods available under the income approach to quantify fair value 
the company used the following methods to quantify fair value of the acquired intangibles at the acquisition date 
the excess earnings method was used for customer relationships and the relief from royalties method was used for the trade name intangibles with a royalty rate of 
the company used the cost method approach to quantify the fair value of the product technology intangible  by using cumulative inflation rates ranging from to the company allocated the residual value of million to goodwill 
goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise 
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
for the period from october  to december   revenue from the sales of clrs products was approximately  net income associated with clrs products and operations cannot be determined given the integration of clrs operations within the company 
reliable information to provide pro forma financial disclosure on the clrs acquisition is currently unavailable and impracticable to prepare at this time 
therefore  such pro forma financial information has not been included herein 
acquisition of aesthera corporation on february   we acquired of the common stock of aesthera corporation  a privately held company for consideration including million in cash and million of shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issued of  was determined based on the volume weighted average closing market price of per share during the five trading days preceding the acquisition date 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement which may require payments ranging from to million in shares of our common stock if certain revenue milestones are achieved related to the sale of aesthera products and if certain acquired aesthera receivables are collected 

table of contents the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach 
key assumptions include i a discount rate of percent and ii probability of milestone achievement ranging from 
as of december  the fair value of the contingent consideration has been reduced to to reflect our updated assessment of the probabilities assigned to achieving the revenue milestones and accordingly a gain was recognized in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december   respectively 
as a result of the acquisition  we have expanded our product offerings by providing treatment of acne to its customers through our direct sales and distribution network worldwide 
our condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of aesthera from the date of acquisition through december  of the total original purchase price of million  million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets  which are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of five to six years 
the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income approach 
the income approach uses a discounted cash flow model 
we calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangibles using an to discount rate 
with respect to intangible assets  there are several methods available under the income approach to quantify fair value 
we used the following methods to quantify fair value of the acquired intangibles at the acquisition date 
the excess earnings method was used for product technology and customer relationships 
the relief from royalties method was used for the trade name intangibles with a royalty rate of 
we allocated the residual value of million to goodwill at february  goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise after 
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
acquisition of reliant technologies  inc on december   we acquired of the common stock of reliant for million in cash and million shares of solta medical common stock and assumption of million of debt  including a million note payable to thermage 
this acquisition expands the market presence of the company 
complementary product offerings allow us to cross sell a more complete product line to physicians and their patients through one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry and an expansive international distribution network 
the acquisition resulted in a combined company with two strong brand names and one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry 
following the acquisition  we changed our name to solta medical  inc the acquisition purchase price totaled a combined million cash paid  million for million shares issued at the share price on the date of announcement   fair value of assumed warrants and approximately million in direct transaction costs 
we recorded an estimate for costs to terminate some activities associated with the reliant operations 
the restructuring accrual of approximately million at december  was principally related to the termination of reliant employees of approximately million and restructuring of facilities of million 

table of contents the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income approach 
the income approach  using a discounted cash flow model  was used to determine the estimated fair values of the acquired intangible assets 
the company calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangibles using an to discount rate 
with respect to intangible assets  there are several methods available under the income approach to quantify fair value 
under this approach the company used the following methods to quantify fair value of the acquired intangibles at the acquisition date 
the excess earnings method was used for the following four intangible assets product technology  customer relationships  royalties intangible and product development contract 
the relief from royalties method was used for the core technology and fraxel trade name intangibles with a royalty rate of and  respectively 
the lost profits method also referred to as the with and without method was used for the non compete agreement with a probability of competition rate of 
the company utilized third party market data ie license agreements to derive valuation assumptions used to fair value certain intangible assets  such as the fraxel trade name and core technology 
of the total original purchase price of approximately million  approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets 
approximately million of the amortizable intangible assets are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of two to years 
in conjunction with the acquisition of reliant  we recorded an expense of approximately million for acquired in process research and development ipr d during the quarter and year ended december   because feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no alternative future use exists 
the ipr d is related to the development of three new products 
the three significant ipr d projects at date of acquisition were as follows project a a next generation dual wave length fraxel re store system  project b a body shaping product  and project c a rejuvenation product for the professional market being developed in a collaborative partnership 
at the date of acquisition  it was estimated that project a would be completed in  project b would be completed in and project c would be completed in project a was completed in september and fda clearance was received in october project b is currently in clinical investigations and project c is pending regulatory approval 
we used the income approach excess earnings method to determine the estimated fair values of the acquired ipr d  which uses a discounted cash flow model  based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimate future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these estimates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
we calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a to discount rate for the related projects 
the after tax cash flows are calculated by applying cost  expense  income tax and contributory asset charge assumptions to the ipr d revenue streams 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these ipr d projects include delays caused by legal actions brought by our competitors and the timing of the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur 
for these and other reasons  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
we allocated the residual value of approximately million to goodwill at december   and adjusted this amount to million during the year ended december  for adjustments to the valuation of inventory acquired  accrued restructuring  prepaid expenses  and adjustments of the acquisition consideration for a shortfall in reliant s closing working capital 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when 
table of contents events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the factors that contributed to a premium on the purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill were the expansion of our recurring revenue model allowing for increased treatment tip usage as well as expanding clinical applications for our physician customers 
access to an expanded base of industry knowledge and expertise 
opportunity to complement our existing products for the aesthetic market with a synergistic technology and new clinical treatment applications 
expansion of our global presence thereby increasing our market penetration 
the company performed a goodwill impairment test at the end of and as a result  no goodwill impairment was identified through december  the test was based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
significant business trends we derive revenue primarily from the sale of systems  treatment tips and consumables 
for the years ended december   and we derived  and respectively  of our revenue from treatment tips and consumable sales  and  and respectively  of our revenue from system sales 
the balance of our revenue is derived from service  research and development and shipping 
in the third quarter of  we launched two new systems  the thermage cpt and fraxel re store dual 
with the acquisition of reliant and aesthera  during we have seen sales of treatment tips and consumables increase as a percentage of our revenue versus system sales  and revenue derived from sales of products and services within north america decreased as a percentage of our total revenue 
we market our products in north america to physicians  primarily dermatologists and plastic surgeons  through a direct sales force and internationally through a network of independent distributors and our direct sales force in certain countries 
in the years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from sales of our products and services within north america  and  and  respectively  of our total sales outside of north america 
we believe that a significant portion of our business will continue to come from international sales through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell our products  combined with expansion into new international markets 
the percentages of our revenue by region are presented in the table below years ended december  north america asia pacific europe middle east rest of the world total net revenue we continue to believe our bifurcated sales force will serve us well 
with the acquisition of reliant and aesthera  we have one of the largest north american direct sales forces in the industry  with about half of the sales force focusing on existing customers and sales of treatment tips  upgrades and training  and the remainder focusing on securing new accounts 

table of contents future operating results are difficult to predict accurately 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including prevailing economic conditions and our customers access to credit  the timing of introduction and the degree of acceptance of future product offerings  unanticipated interruptions and expenses related to our manufacturing operations  and the performance of our direct sales force and international distributors 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
we have implemented a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include fraxel consumables as well as offering incentives to doctors who become fraxel  thermage and isolaz customers 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
significant industry factors our business is subject to the impact of economic conditions on the growth of the industry and to our ability to continue to develop new products  applications and innovative technologies  obtain and maintain regulatory clearances for our products  protect our proprietary technology  and successfully market and distribute our products 
our industry is characterized by seasonally lower demand during the third calendar quarter of the year  when both physicians and prospective patients take summer vacations 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments  the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on aesthetic procedures could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that impact our business is provided in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those described below 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred when title and risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and remaining obligations are considered perfunctory 
for most of our product sales  transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership occurs when product is shipped 
revenue is recorded net of customer and distributor discounts and rebates 
revenue from the sale of extended service contracts for products beyond their warranty term is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable extended contract 
we also earn service revenue from customers outside of their warranty term or extended service contracts 
such service revenue is recognized as the services are provided 

table of contents our system sales in the united states have post sale obligations of installation and training  as applicable 
these obligations are fulfilled after product shipment 
when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  we will defer all revenue until all elements are delivered or objective and reliable evidence of fair value has been determined for all undelivered elements 
we sell to end users in the united states and to distributors and end users outside of the united states 
sales to end users and distributors do not include return rights 
we typically recognize revenues upon shipment for sales to our independent third party distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment  other than replacement parts warranty coverage 
the distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty services for our products 
also  our distributors are responsible for obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals outside of the united states 
while the regulatory approval process varies greatly by country and we may assist the distributor in the regulatory approval process  the responsibility belongs to the distributor 
we do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributors to return or exchange products and the distributors are obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of whether the distributors are able to resell the product 
for sales transactions in which collectability is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate appropriate allowances based upon any specific customer collection issues  our history of losses  economic conditions and age of customer balances 
our assessment of the ability of our customers to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  a review of their financial status  as well as consideration of their payment history with us 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we offered a three year warranty for thermage systems sold in the united states  one year for fraxel systems sold worldwide and a one year replacement parts warranty for systems sold to distributors outside of the united states through december  beginning in january   we offered a one year warranty period for systems sold worldwide 
we also provide a warranty for our consumable products 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market value being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a monthly basis and updated quarterly and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 

table of contents impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
our goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare its fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we move on to step if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
to date  the fair value of the company has exceeded the carrying value and thus no goodwill impairment change has been recorded 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
this allows us to derive an implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment change would be recognized for the excess 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired 
the goodwill test is based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
no goodwill impairment was identified through december  impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
litigation and claims from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters and claims  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
we do not believe the final disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial statements and future cash flows of the company 
also  we do not record gain contingencies 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by us federal  state and local  as well as foreign tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
valuation of share based awards share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants incorporates our historical volatility and volatility of similar public entities in the aesthetics market due to a lack of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price 
when establishing the expected term assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenue 
revenue is derived from the sales of systems  treatment tips and other consumables  and service and other revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the contributions from the sales of isolaz products and services of million  an increase in tips and consumable sales and an increase in system sales and system upgrades  partially offset by a decline in other revenue and handpiece sales 
system sales for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in sales of treatment tips and other consumables was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses 
gross margin was of revenue for the year ended december   compared with of revenue for the same period in the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a higher proportion of higher margin tip sales  lower manufacturing period costs as a percentage of higher sales volumes and a decrease in purchase price related adjustment to cost of sales that resulted from the acquisition of reliant in december  partially offset by a higher proportion of lower margin system upgrade sales and an increase in amortization expense from intangibles acquired in the aesthera and clrs acquisitions 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and costs related to customer attended workshops and trade shows and advertising  as well as marketing and customer service expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in the increase was 
table of contents primarily attributable to increased headcount and related personnel and travel and entertainment expenses of million from the acquisition of aesthera and clrs  an increase of million in discretionary marketing expenses  an increase of million in supplies  telecommunication  depreciation and allocated information technology and facility expenses  and million of amortization of intangibles acquired in the aesthera and clrs acquisitions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  clinical and regulatory costs  material costs and regulatory and quality assurance costs not directly related to the manufacturing of our products 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in compared to the same period of  professional services increased by million  partially offset by a decrease of million in employee payroll and related expenses and a decrease of million in clinical studies and other r d project costs

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  legal and accounting fees  human resources costs and other general operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with million for the same period in the decrease from the prior year period was due to a decrease of million in professional services  primarily due to a decrease in outside accounting and legal fees  a decrease of million in business insurance and a decrease of million in bad debt expense  partially offset by an increase of million in employee payroll and related expenses and an increase of million in acquisition related expense resulting from the acquisition of aesthera and clrs during litigation settlement 
in may  we reached an agreement with alma that settled patent related claims of the parties against each other 
under this agreement  the parties granted each other a covenant not to sue under the patents in the suit and related patents 
we received a one time payment of million and incurred external legal expenses of  for the year ended december  this resulted in a net litigation settlement gain of million in our statement of operations for the year ended december  interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest income generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments 
interest and other income decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in  due to lower interest income from lower average investment balances since all the company s marketable securities matured in  partially offset by increased foreign exchange gains during the period due to currency fluctuations interest and other expense 
interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from borrowings on the margin account  line of credit and term loans 
interest and other expenses were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to lower debt balances in gain loss on investments 
during the year ended december   we realized million in gains on investments that had either been sold or matured in our portfolio during we had no investments in provision benefit for income taxes 
there was an income tax provision of million and a tax benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for year ended december  primarily represented additions to amt taxes and additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented refunds of income taxes  partially offset by additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we did not recognize any tax benefits in relation to the loss before income taxes for the year ended december  as we maintained a full valuation allowance for deferred taxes 

table of contents years ended december  and december  net revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the contribution from fraxel sales in resulting from the reliant acquisition in december system sales for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in sales of treatment tips and other consumables was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in these increases were due to the contributions from fraxel sales resulting from the reliant acquisition and an increase in thermage system upgrades during  partially offset by a decrease in thermage tip revenue 
cost of revenue 
gross margin was of revenue for the year ended december   compared with of revenue for the same period in the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to a million fair value adjustment to cost of sales resulting from sales of inventory assumed in the reliant acquisition  million of amortization expense from intangible assets from the reliant acquisition  a higher proportion of lower margin system and system upgrade sales than higher margin tip sales primarily resulting from the reliant acquisition  unfavorable overhead absorption due to lower than planned production volume  and downward sales pricing pressure caused by the continuing difficulties in the economy  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increased headcount and related personnel and travel and entertainment expenses of million from the reliant acquisition  an increase of million in discretionary marketing expenses  an increase of million in professional services  an increase of million in supplies  telecommunication  depreciation and allocated information technology and facility expenses  and million of amortization of intangibles acquired in the reliant acquisition

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared with million for the same period in the increase from the prior year period was due to an increase of million in employee payroll and related expenses  and an increase of million in professional fees primarily due to increased outside accounting  tax and legal fees  partially offset by million in merger related expenses incurred in during the first quarter of  we reached an advanced stage of negotiations with a potential acquisition target and had performed significant due diligence on the project before negotiations were terminated 
the million in outside advisory fees incurred in the first quarter of in pursuing this acquisition did not recur in interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest income generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments 
interest and other income decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in  due to lower average cash and investment balances following our use of cash in the reliant acquisition 

table of contents interest and other expense 
interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from borrowings on the margin account  line of credit and term loan during  none of which existed in interest and other expenses were  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
gain loss on investments 
during the year ended december   we realized million in gains on investments that had either been sold or matured in our portfolio during the during  we deemed certain declines in the fair market value of our available for sale marketable securities to be other than temporary and as a result  recorded a million loss in the year ended december  of the million loss recorded during the year  approximately million was related to a single security in our investment portfolio 
provision benefit for income taxes 
there was an income tax provision of  and a tax benefit of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented additions to amt taxes and additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions  while the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented refunds of income taxes  partially offset by additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we did not recognize any tax benefits in relation to the loss before income taxes for the year ended december  as we maintained a full valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
stock based compensation for the years ended december  and and  employee and non employee stock based compensation expense were allocated as follows in thousands years ended december  cost of revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense at december   the total compensation cost related to stock based awards granted or modified to employees and directors but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures 
we will amortize this cost on a straight line basis over the remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized on a straight line basis 
the options generally vest ratably over four years 
the values attributable to these options are amortized over the service period and the unvested portion of these options is remeasured as the services are provided and the options are earned 
the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the deemed fair value of the common stock fluctuates

table of contents reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures the following presentation includes non gaap measures 
our non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures 
for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures  the reasons why management uses these measures  the usefulness of these matters and the material limitation of these measures  see items below 
years ended december  in thousands of dollars  except share and per share data gaap gross margin gaap gross margin as of sales non gaap adjustments to gross margin gaap gross margin amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges stock based compensation non gaap gross margin non gaap gross margin as of sales gaap loss from operations non gaap adjustments to net loss from operations acquired in process research and development amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses stock based compensation non gaap income loss from operations depreciation expenses non gaap ebitda gaap net loss non gaap adjustments to net loss acquired in process research and development amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses loss on investments stock based compensation non gaap net income loss gaap basic net loss per share non gaap adjustments to basic loss per share acquired in process research and development amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses loss on investments stock based compensation non gaap basic net income loss per share non gaap diluted net income loss per share gaap weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating basic net loss per share gaap weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating diluted net loss per share adjustments for dilutive potential common stock weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating non gaap diluted net income loss per share 
table of contents the non gaap financial measures are non gaap gross margin  non gaap gross margin as a of sales  non gaap operating income  non gaap adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share  which adjust for the following items in process r d  amortization of acquired intangibles and other non cash acquisition related charges  severance expenses  acquisition related expenses  loss on investments and stock based compensation expense 
we believe that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is useful for investors  and as such measures are used by our management  for the reasons associated with each of the adjusting items as described below amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges are non cash charges  such as amortization of acquired intangibles  that can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions 
we consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non gaap financial measures 
we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 
severance expenses include acquisition related severance expenses and are disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because these charges are unique to specific acquisitions  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
acquisition related costs include direct costs of the acquisition and expenses related to acquisition integration activities 
examples of costs directly related to an acquisition include transaction fees  due diligence costs and certain legal costs related to acquired litigation 
these expenses vary significantly in size and amount and are disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because these charges are unique to specific acquisitions  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
stock based compensation expense consist of expense relating to stock based awards issued to employees  outside directors and non employees including stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock units with performance based vesting and our employee stock purchase plan 
because of varying available valuation methodologies  subjective assumptions and the variety of award types  we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies  and for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods 
in addition  we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of stock based compensation expenses on our operating results 
depreciation expense includes depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  machinery and equipment  software and computers and equipment 
our management excludes this charge from operating income loss to compute non gaap earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
acquired in process research and development constitute non cash charges that vary significantly in size and amount depending on the business combination and  therefore  are disregarded by our management when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends 
we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of these charges on our operating results 
loss on investments relate to the sale and maturity of our marketable securities 
these losses or gains can vary significantly in size and amount 
our management excludes these losses or gains when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings trends  and therefore excludes these items when presenting non gaap financial measures 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had working capital of million  which included million of cash and cash equivalents 
in january  we entered into securities purchase agreements in connection with a private placement of our securities to certain institutional and other accredited investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue i an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock  and ii warrants to purchase an

the sale of securities resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses were approximately million 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank lender for a million secured revolving loan facility and a million secured term loan 
we drew down million on the revolving loan facility and million as a term loan in march  and repaid the revolving loan in full in april on june   we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement which provides for an increase of the secured revolving loan facility to million and an additional million secured term loan 
on march   we entered into a third amendment to the loan agreement which provides for an increase of the commitment under the loan facility by adding a million secured term loan facility  amended certain financial covenants and extended the term of the existing revolving loan facility 
on october   we entered into a fourth amendment to the loan agreement  which authorized us to consummate the acquisition of clrs technology corporation on october  borrowings under the original revolving loan facility accrue interest at prime plus per annum  subject to a minimum of per annum 
borrowings under the secured term loan facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal or greater of i or ii the three year us treasury note yield on the funding date plus 
interest on borrowings under the revolving loan facility is payable monthly 
the secured term loans are payable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio and minimum ebitda 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  at december   million was outstanding on the revolving loan facility and million was outstanding on the secured term loan 
we repaid all funds drawn from the revolving loan facility in january in connection with the loan and security agreement  our subsidiary  reliant technologies  llc reliant llc  entered into an unconditional guaranty  dated as of march  the guaranty  in favor of lender  pursuant to which reliant llc guaranteed all of our obligations under the loan agreement  and a security agreement  dated as of march   with lender  pursuant to which reliant llc granted a security interest in substantially all of its personal property to collateralize its obligations under the guaranty 
in the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of the acquisition of reliant technologies  inc  we drew down on funds from a margin account with jp morgan chase  collateralized by our marketable investments 
pursuant to the terms of credit offered by jp morgan chase  we may borrow up to of the market value of our investment account at an interest rate of the day libor rate plus basis points

our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and continued progress of our research and development of new products 
we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest to address new markets 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations  along with our existing credit facilities  will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future liquidity requirements may increase beyond currently expected levels if we fail to maintain compliance with covenants in our bank loan agreements or if unanticipated expenses or other uses of our cash arise 
in order to meet our future liquidity needs  we may seek additional equity and or debt financing 
such additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all  particularly in the short term due to the current credit and equity market funding environments 
any future equity financing would result in dilution to our stockholders 
the availability of financing or merger opportunities will depend  in part  on market conditions  and the outlook for our company

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable used to allocate revenue 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
we will be required to apply this guidance prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   however  earlier application is permitted 
our adoption of topic on january  will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu   fair value measurement and disclosures topic  which relates to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented 
table of contents separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements related to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements 
our adoption of topic on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk currently  most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars though the amount of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses has been growing due to the expansion of our direct sales to end users in foreign countries 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products as well as cause variability in our revenue  expenses  interest and other income expense 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates will impact our interest sensitive credit agreement and accordingly may impact interest expense 
we have determined that if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  there would be no material impact to interest expense over a year period
