executive overview our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi tenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies 
we refer to this business as our rental and management operations  which accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  increased expansion activity in international markets and changes to our organizational structure have led us to separately disclose our rental and management operations in two reportable segments domestic rental and management and international rental and management 
through our network development services segment  we also offer tower related services domestically  including site acquisition  zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services  which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 
accordingly  our continuing operations are now reported in three segments  domestic rental and management  international rental and management and network development services 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non cancellable term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of december is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue  absent the impact of straight line lease accounting 
in addition  most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease 
these contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent  inflation  or a fixed percentage plus inflation 
revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancellable term of the applicable agreement 
we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our tenants  which increases the non cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues 
the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts  which typically may not be cancelled or  in some instances  may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee 
accordingly  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their 
table of contents terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations 
during the year ended december   loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than of our rental and management operations revenues 
rental and management operations revenue growth 
the primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for our domestic and international rental and management segments are recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites  contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases  net of cancellations  new revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites  and new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites 
we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites  which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites 
in addition  we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband service providers 
our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities  which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth 
in addition  we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria 
rental and management operations organic revenue growth 
consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites  our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and  to a lesser extent  the location of and available capacity on our existing sites 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs  the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 
domestic 
the majority of wireless subscribers in the united states currently utilize g technology based handsets  for both voice and data applications 
as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications  wireless service providers continue to invest in their g networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites 
this level of wireless communications services growth has produced consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment and as a result  we have experienced consistent demand for our communications sites 
in addition  wireless service providers in the united states continue to pursue new avenues for growth  such as deploying g technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution 
as wireless service providers begin to deploy g wireless networks  we expect them to overlay g equipment across their existing networks of communications sites  resulting in additional revenue 
subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand  we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their g wireless networks as subscribers transition from g handsets 
in connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment  this technology migration path has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate their networks from one technology to the next to remain competitive 

table of contents international 
in general  our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services 
as a result  demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments  new market entrants and initial g data network deployments 
for example  in india  nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in g data networks  as a result of recent spectrum auctions 
in mexico and brazil  where nationwide voice networks have been deployed  some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their g data networks  and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in g data networks 
in markets such as chile and peru  recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants  who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and g data networks 
we believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks 
rental and management operations new site revenue growth 
during the year ended december   we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities  including the acquisition and construction of approximately  sites 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios  both domestically and internationally  that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio 
new sites acquired or constructed domestic international the majority of sites acquired or constructed internationally during and were in india and our newly launched operations in chile  colombia and peru 
network development services segment revenue growth 
as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 
through our network development services segment  we offer tower related services  including site acquisition  zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services  which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 
rental and management operations expenses 
our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense 
in general  our rental and management segment level selling  general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint  we may incur additional segment level selling  general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas 
our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 
reit election 
as we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state nols  we are actively considering an election to a reit for us federal and  where applicable  state income tax purposes 
we may make the determination to elect reit status for the taxable year beginning january   as early as the second half of  subject to the approval of our board of directors  although there is no certainty as to the timing of a reit election or whether we will make a reit election at all 

table of contents non gaap financial measures included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and accretion  as adjusted adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from discontinued operations  net  income from equity method investments  income tax provision benefit  other income expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  interest expense  interest income  other operating expenses  depreciation  amortization and accretion  and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap 
rather  adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is the primary measure used by our management team when evaluating the performance of our operating segments  it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants and it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation  amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives  particularly where acquisitions and non operating factors are involved 
our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable gaap measure  has been included below

in the near term  we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
purchases under the buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases 
under the buyback  we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
to facilitate repurchases  we purchase our common stock pursuant to trading plans under rule b of the exchange act  which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the revolving credit facility and term loan 
as a result of these swap agreements  the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at december  for the revolving credit facility and term loan was

table of contents operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancellable initial terms  as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases  thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease 
primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet  primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash 
other long term liabilities exclude million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
refinancing activities redemption of ati senior subordinated notes during the year ended december   ati issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due ati notes 
in accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the ati notes  the remaining ati notes were redeemed at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  september   for an aggregate purchase price of million 
upon completion of this redemption  none of the ati notes remained outstanding 
interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we held interest rate swap agreements  all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  and which have an aggregate notional amount of million  interest rates ranging from to and expiration dates through march as of december   we held interest rate swaps  which had an aggregate notional amount of million  to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our revolving credit facility and term loan 
during the year ended december   one of the contracts matured 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan 
the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
these include limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guarantees  sales of assets and liens 
the loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with 
table of contents which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage  senior secured leverage and interest coverage  as set forth below 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda as defined in the loan agreement of to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda as defined in the loan agreement of to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
interest coverage ratio this ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda as defined in the loan agreement to interest expense of not less than to 
based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december   our interest expense  which was million for that period  could increase by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis  we would be in breach of these covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility  but would constitute a default  which could result in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization 
the loan agreement related to the securitization involved assets related to  broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the borrowers  through a private offering of billion of commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series the certificates 
the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations 
among other things  the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets 
the borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities  including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors 
the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets  promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization 
table of contents loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization  and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers  including the right to conduct site investigations 
under the terms of the securitization loan agreement  the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization  which must be deposited  and thereafter distributed  solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan 
the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan 
on a monthly basis  all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments  to fund required reserves  to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan  referred to as excess cash flow  is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us 
during the year ended december   the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately million 
in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us  the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage dscr 
for this purpose  dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan 
pursuant to one such test  if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were x or less  during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the securitization in may  or x or less  thereafter  x or x as applicable  the cash trap dscr  then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 
additionally  while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the securitization loan until april  excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an amortization period under the securitization loan until april an amortization period would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below x  during the five year period commencing on the closing date of the securitization in may  or x thereafter x or x as applicable  the minimum dscr 
in such a case  all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters  and so would not be available for distribution to us 
consequently  a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers 
additionally  a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us  which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures  including tower construction and acquisitions  and our stock repurchase program 
in addition  if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization  the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization  in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 
as of december   the borrowers dscr was x 
based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december  and the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan  the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr  and approximately million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 

table of contents as discussed above  we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program  we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities 
if we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital  we may be unable to do so  or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise  we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives  refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 
in addition  our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities 
as set forth under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and  consequently  a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to impairment of assets including goodwill  asset retirement obligations  acquisitions  revenue recognition  rent expense  stock based compensation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
impairment of assets assets subject to depreciation and amortization we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment at least annually or whenever events  changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 
we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis  which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues 
a cashflow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates  among other items  the tower location  the tower location demographics  the timing of additions of new tenants  lease rates and estimated length of tenancy 
to the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers  the towers and network location intangible assets are impaired 
we monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment  such as high levels of turnover or attrition  non renewal of a significant number of contracts  or the cancellation or termination of a relationship 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customer related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value of the customer related intangible asset may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the 
table of contents asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset  as compared to the asset s carrying value 
we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 
impairment of assets goodwill assets not subject to amortization we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually as of december or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
as a result of our recent expansion into international markets and changes to our organization structure  we have concluded that our rental and management operations are comprised of two reportable segments domestic rental and management and international rental and management 
although our reportable segments have changed  there has been no change to the reporting units which are at a level below that of our reportable segments used for testing goodwill 
all of our goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments 
we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment 
when conducting this test  we employ a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis 
the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance  terminal sales growth rate  management s expectations of future operating results  the current weighted average cost of capital  and a current tax rate 
under the first step of this test  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit  as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows  to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we conduct the second step of this test  in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
during the year ended december   no impairment was determined under the first step of the test  as the fair value of the respective reporting units is substantially in excess of their carrying values 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually  which we determined to be reasonable  would impact our conclusions domestic rental and management reporting unit a reduction in projected net income  or basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital  or a reduction in terminal sales growth rate 
international rental and management reporting units a reduction in projected net income  or basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital  or a reduction in terminal sales growth rate 
asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located  in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation  which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of million  respectively 
the increase in primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset 
table of contents retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the criteria of a business combination  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  including any contingent consideration  at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
for those acquisitions that do not meet the criteria of a business combination  we first allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customer base and network location intangibles 
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods 
when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired  we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age  condition and the economic useful life of the asset 
when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired  we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows  including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 
the determination of the final purchase price and allocation may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized 
revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured  regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancellable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the fixed  non cancellable terms of the applicable leases 
total rental and management straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete 
we derive the largest portion of our revenues  corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of customers in the telecommunications industry  and approximately of our revenues are derived from four customers in the industry 
in addition  we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas 
we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and customers 
in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight line basis 
this assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed 
to the extent the amounts  based on management s estimates  may not be collectible  recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved 
any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer s inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured 
rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations  which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time 
we calculate straight line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods  if any  for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us 
table of contents such that renewal appears  at the inception of the lease  to be reasonably assured 
certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease  if the tenant exercises its renewal option 
for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease  we calculate our straight line ground rent over the term of the ground lease  including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation 
in addition to the straight line ground rent expense recorded  we also record an associated straight line rent liability in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited 
the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock  expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes 
to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns  which may differ from the current rate 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards  equity investments and foreign items 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets  primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards  as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately billion and billion in federal and state taxable income  respectively  from january  to december  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future  we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination  
table of contents which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe  or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses 
we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to million 
as of december   we have classified approximately million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also classified approximately million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws  regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  accounting standards updates in october  the fasb issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this guidance allows companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables
