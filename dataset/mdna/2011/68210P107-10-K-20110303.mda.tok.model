company overview business 
the company operates through three primary subsidiaries omega protein  inc  omega shipyard  inc 
and cyvex nutrition  inc 
omega protein  inc omega protein  which is the company s principal operating subsidiary  operates in the menhaden processing business and is the successor to a business conducted since omega shipyard  inc omega shipyard owns a drydock facility in moss point  mississippi that is used to provide shoreside maintenance for omega protein s fishing fleet and  subject to outside demand and excess capacity  occasionally for third party vessels 
cyvex nutrition  inc cyvex  founded in and acquired by the company on december   is located in irvine  california and participates in the nutraceutical industry as an ingredient provider 
revenues from omega shipyard for third party vessel work and cyvex were not material in the company also has a number of other immaterial direct and indirect subsidiaries 
omega protein is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
omega protein s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
omega protein s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
omega protein s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production  feed production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as attractants for animal feeds and baits and as fertilizers 
fishing 
omega protein s harvesting season generally extends from early may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from mid april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  omega protein fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal and oil purchased from other suppliers 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at omega protein s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 
on september   omega protein s abbeville and cameron  louisiana fish processing facilities were damaged by hurricane ike 
both of these facilities were non operational immediately after the hurricane 
operations at the abbeville fish processing facility were restored to full capacity on september  the cameron fish processing facility was fully functional prior to the beginning of the fishing season 
these hurricane damages adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the direct impact of the hurricane upon omega protein was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused omega protein to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents during  omega protein experienced higher costs of production and below average fish catch 
the higher costs of production were primarily attributed to increased energy  labor and repair costs 
the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions mainly associated with hurricane activity 
as a result of the higher costs of production and below average fish catch  omega protein experienced significantly higher per unit product costs approximately increase as compared to the fishing season which adversely affected the company s earnings for the impacts of higher cost inventories were carried forward and adversely affected the company s earnings through the second quarter of in addition  the lost fishing days resulted in lower product volumes available for sale in the first half of these higher cost product inventories carried forward from the fishing season were largely sold as of june  during  omega protein reduced overall costs of production by approximately million as compared to by lowering and  in some cases  eliminating certain expenses  renegotiating more favorable vendor contracts  and fixing energy prices via energy swaps more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  due to lower than average fish catch  omega protein continued to experience higher per unit product costs which contributed to lower than anticipated company earnings for the second half of in addition  the lower than average fish catch resulted in lower product volumes available for sale in the first half of these higher cost product inventories carried forward from the fishing season were largely sold as of june  during  omega protein experienced abnormally below average fish catch in the gulf of mexico from the months of june to september as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster 
the gulf of mexico below average fish catch was partially mitigated by an above average fish catch in the atlantic for the fishing season and an above average fish catch in the gulf of mexico for the month of october  once the majority of the fishing restrictions were lifted as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster and fishing conditions returned to normal 
the overall decrease in fish catch negatively impacted omega protein s inventory available to sell during the second half of and its per unit product costs 
the high per unit product costs were partially offset by million in emergency payments from the gulf coast claims facility gccf which were received during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster 
harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the omega protein s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 

table of contents omega protein s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which omega protein has no control 
for illustrative purposes  omega protein s total yield for the fishing season was lower compared to the average total yield the previous five fishing seasons 
the company believes that the causes of lower total yields relate to fish diet  weather and water temperature but such causes are not generally well understood 
in addition  as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster  a greater percentage than normal of omega protein s fish catch was harvested at its reedville  virginia facility which typically has lower total yields as compared to the yields from omega protein s gulf of mexico facilities 
gulf of mexico total yields were consistent with the previous five fishing seasons while atlantic yields were approximately lower as compared to the average total yield of the previous five fishing seasons 
poor total yields result in increased per unit inventory costs and fewer volumes available for future sale and  as a result  have at times materially impacted the amount of products that omega protein has been able to produce from its available fish catch 
markets 
pricing for omega protein s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  omega protein has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
during  omega protein s production percentage of specialty meal products was approximately of total meal production 
during and  omega protein s specialty meal production percentage accounted for and  respectively  of total meal production 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependent upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company continues to market its refined fish oil to food manufactures and other related industries 
omega protein has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  and  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions and other factors such as the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster  and in and omega protein expanded its purchase and resale of other fish meals and oils primarily us  panamanian  peruvian  moroccan  and mexican fish meal and us menhaden oil 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from omega protein s base domestic production  these operations provide omega protein with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets  some of which  omega protein has not historically had a presence 
omega protein did not purchase any fish meal or fish oil during during the year ended december   omega protein purchased approximately  tons of fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
during the year ended december   omega protein purchased approximately  tons of fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
omega protein sells a sizeable portion of its products on a two to twelve month forward contract basis with the balance sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
omega protein s sales contracts generally contain force majeure and other production allocation provisions 
due to the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster  omega protein has purchased additional fish meal from a third party to supplement its production and received partial reimbursement from bp through the gccf for additional costs associated with this purchase 
historically  fish meal and fish oil sold on a forward contract basis has fluctuated from year to year based upon perceived market availability and forward price expectations 
as of february   omega protein had either sold or sold forward on a contract basis approximately  tons of fish meal and  tons of fish oil for omega protein s annual revenues are highly dependent on pricing  annual fish catch  production yields and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
omega protein determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on existing contracts  prevailing market prices of the 
table of contents products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
omega protein s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  omega protein attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
omega protein s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth omega protein s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles other total acquisition of cyvex nutrition  inc on december   the company completed the acquisition of of the outstanding common stock of cyvex nutrition  inc cyvex  a california corporation  in a cash transaction pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement with the founder and sole shareholder of cyvex 
cyvex now is a wholly owned subsidiary of omega protein corporation 
cyvex is a premium  science based nutraceutical supplier to dietary supplement manufacturers that focus on human health and wellness 
the company believes that the acquisition of cyvex will expand its presence in the human health and wellness market and will provide access to the top supplement manufacturers who purchase a variety of ingredients  including fish oil 
as consideration for the acquisition of cyvex  the company paid cash of million  utilizing cash on hand  with no contingent consideration  other than a post closing adjustment of million to account for differences between estimated working capital and actual working capital of cyvex as of the closing date 
the company also agreed to pay an additional million as part of the base purchase price to cyvex s former owner pending receipt of an approval from the internal revenue service related to cyvex s prior status as a subchapter s corporation from until the closing date 
a favorable approval was received subsequent to the closing date and the company anticipates making all or a portion of the million payment in the first quarter of cyvex will make an internal revenue code section h election in conjunction with the acquisition in order to treat the stock sale as if cyvex had sold all of its assets at their fair market value to the company 
the result of the intended code section h election was the recognition of an approximate million liability for state franchise tax that the company anticipates paying in the first quarter of as such  the company has accrued million as of december  related to payments to be made to cyvex s former owner subsequent to december  the results from operations for cyvex for the day period from the date of acquisition to december  were not material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments used in applying the company s critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined the 
table of contents critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and requires the company to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of inventory notes and  valuation of losses related to jones act and worker s compensation insurance claims note  valuation of income and deferred taxes notes and and the valuation of pension plan obligations notes and 
specifically in regards to inventory  omega protein s per unit cost of production is estimated prior to the beginning of each fishing season based on estimated total units of production divided by total estimated fishing costs including off season costs 
omega protein adjusts the cost of sales  unallocated inventory cost pool and inventory balances at the end of the nd  rd and th quarters based on revised estimates of total units of production to total inventoriable costs 
for the most part  omega protein begins selling its current season s production during the rd quarter and sells that production until the nd quarter of the following year 
from to  the average cost per unit of production estimate increased from the rd quarter to the th quarter of each respective year 
during  as a result of the larger than anticipated production in the th quarter  cost per unit of production for the th quarter decreased as compared to the rd quarter 
the company also has other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to the allowance of doubtful accounts note  goodwill and other intangible assets notes and  valuation of shares based compensation note and interest rate and energy swap valuations notes and 
the company believes that these key accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective as its critical accounting policies  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies
