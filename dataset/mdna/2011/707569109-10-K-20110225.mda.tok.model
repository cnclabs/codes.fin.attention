item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari mutuel properties 
we currently own  manage  or have ownership interests in twenty three facilities in the following sixteen jurisdictions colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  louisiana  maine  maryland  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  west virginia  and ontario 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions including the acquisitions of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  crc holdings  inc  the bullwhackers properties  hollywood casino corporation  argosy gaming company argosy  black gold casino at zia park  and sanford orlando kennel club  greenfield projects such as at hollywood casino at penn national race course and hollywood slots hotel and raceway  and most recently hollywood casino perryville  which opened on september  and is maryland first casino  as well as our proposed facilities in ohio and joint venture in kansas and property expansions such as hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
on july   we closed the transaction to purchase beulah park in grove city  ohio and separately established a joint venture that owns and operates the maryland jockey club 
the vast majority of our revenues is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games  which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our off track wagering facilities otws 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop volume indicators and win or hold percentage 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions 
we continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties  the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
current capital projects are ongoing at several of our new and existing properties  including our facilities under construction in ohio and our joint venture in kansas 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 

table of contents executive summary current economic conditions continue to adversely impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as operating results at certain of our properties 
we believe that the current economic conditions  including  but not limited to  high unemployment levels  low levels of consumer confidence  weakness in the housing and consumer credit markets and increased stock market volatility  have resulted in reduced levels of discretionary consumer spending 
as a result  customer spend per visit for the years ended december  and have been at relatively low levels compared to earlier periods 
in order to mitigate the impact of these conditions  we have increasingly focused on cost management  such as monitoring staff levels and establishing effective marketing programs  to continue to generate strong cash flow 
although the current economic environment has been challenging  we believe our strengths include our relatively low leverage ratios compared to the regional casino companies that we directly compete with and the ability of our operations to generate positive cash flow 
these two factors have allowed us to develop what we believe to be attractive future growth opportunities in new and existing regional gaming markets 
we have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on increased gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit gaming in these jurisdictions 
financial highlights the major factors affecting our results for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were goodwill and other impairment losses of million during the year ended december  compared to million in the corresponding period in the prior year

recent developments the following are recent developments that have had or will have an impact on us on december   the first phase of the new permanent land based pavilion at hollywood casino joliet was opened to the public and the facility was transitioned to the hollywood casino brand 
on march   hollywood casino joliet  which was undergoing a million renovation  was closed following a fire that started in the land based pavilion at the facility 
all customers and employees were successfully evacuated  and the fire was contained on the land side of the property before it could spread to the adjacent casino barge 
on june   the casino barge was reopened with temporary land based facilities  and we began construction of a new land based pavilion 
at the time of the fire  we carried a builders risk insurance policy for the on going renovations with a policy limit of million  inclusive of million for delay in completion and million for property damage 
the builders risk insurance policy included a  property damage deductible and a day delay in completion deductible for the peril of fire 
in addition  we carried comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance for the operational components of hollywood casino joliet with an overall limit of million 
the operational insurance policy included a million property damage deductible and a hour business interruption deductible for the peril of fire 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax loss for the insurance deductibles for property damage  business interruption and employee lost wages  as well as a write off of construction fees related to the renovation that are not recoverable under our insurance policies and certain consulting fees 
during the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  in insurance proceeds related to the fire at hollywood casino joliet 
in  the insurance recovery amount exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged  destroyed or abandoned and other costs incurred as a result of the fire at hollywood casino joliet  and as such  we recorded a pre tax gain of million during the year ended december  we continue to work with our insurance providers to settle the claims related to the fire and we anticipate additional proceeds in future periods

as a result of the denial to hear the case by the united states supreme court  all appeals have been exhausted and the order dismissing the case has become a final order

on may   in a statewide election in ohio  the voters determined that our casino in columbus will be located at the site of the former delphi automotive plant along columbus west side 
as a result of the election  we initiated the process to sell the parcel of land originally approved by the voters that we purchased in columbus arena district  and reclassified the land as held for sale 
we obtained an appraisal to determine the estimated fair market value of the parcel of land that we purchased in columbus arena district  and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which was comprised of the difference between the land estimated fair market value less costs to sell and its carrying value 
the project scope for hollywood casino columbus  a million hollywood themed casino in columbus  ohio  inclusive of million in licensing fees  is in development  with a planned casino opening of up to  slot machines  table games and poker tables  structured and surface parking  as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge

we  along with our partner in kansas entertainment  international speedway corporation international speedway  will share 
table of contents equally the cost of developing and constructing the proposed facility 
we estimate that our share of the project will be approximately million 
critical accounting policies we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the policies related to the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting policies  which require us to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within our consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions  projections for future operations  and data obtained from third party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value in step of the impairment test  then step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of 
table of contents goodwill for that reporting unit 
if the implied value of goodwill is less than the goodwill allocated for that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company considers its gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
the company uses a market approach model  which includes the use of forecasted adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and certain other income and expenses  and inclusive of loss from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted ebitda multiples  as the company believes that adjusted ebitda is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use adjusted ebitda as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties including the evaluation of operating personnel 
in addition  we believe that an adjusted ebitda multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies 
changes in the estimated adjusted ebitda multiples or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
forecasted adjusted ebitda levels based on our annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which our reporting units operate 
for example  increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and or lower customer spend per visit 
in addition  the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate can result in opportunities for the company to expand its operations 
however  it also has the impact of increasing competition for our established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations 
lastly  increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted adjusted ebitda 
the adjusted ebitda multiple utilized by the company in its goodwill impairment valuation methodology is determined based on the company current enterprise value  increased for a control premium 
the control premium assumption is based on acquisitions of precedent transactions of comparable businesses 
in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach  management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units  including recent operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and other market data 
these considerations can lead the company to modify its individual reporting units adjusted ebitda multiple 
ebitda multiples can be significantly impacted by a company present and future cost of capital  the future growth opportunities for the industry as well as for the company itself  general market sentiment  investors perceptions of senior management effectiveness at deploying capital and managing overall operations  as well as pending or recently completed merger transactions 
assumptions and estimates about future adjusted ebitda levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective 
they are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy  which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance our overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit 

table of contents as of the company most recent impairment analysis test performed on october   we applied an estimated adjusted ebitda multiple ranging between and to the individual reporting unit forecasted adjusted ebitda 
with the exception of hollywood casino lawrenceburg  hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet  each of our reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by approximately or more 
however  we do not believe that the margin by which our reporting units fair value exceeds their carrying value is an accurate predictor of the likelihood of future impairment charges or the potential magnitude of such charges 
this is because the revenue and earning streams in our industry can vary significantly based on various circumstances  which in many cases are outside of the company control  and as such are extremely difficult to predict and quantify 
we have disclosed several of these circumstances in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
for instance  changes in legislation that approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions  further expands gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate  new state legislation that requires the implementation of smoking bans at our casinos or any other events outside of our control that make the customer experience less desirable can result in sudden  dramatic and in some cases permanent declines in customer visitations 
as such  we believe at this time all of our reporting units are at risk of goodwill impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges 
due to decreased earning projections at our properties in the chicagoland regional market resulting from an anticipated increase in competition from the scheduled opening of a million casino in the second half of in des plaines  illinois  as well as continued challenging market conditions in the chicagoland regional market  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million and million for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet  respectively  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million at hollywood casino lawrenceburg due to the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in ohio 
during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million at various properties due to a decline in our share price  an overall reduction in industry valuations  and property operating performance in the then current economic environment 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life  including the management service contract for casino rama  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 

table of contents the company goodwill and other intangible assets by reporting unit at december  is shown below 
reporting unit remaining goodwill and other intangible assets at december  hollywood casino lawrenceburg hollywood casino joliet hollywood casino aurora argosy casino riverside black gold casino at zia park argosy casino alton argosy casino sioux city hollywood casino baton rouge others total income taxes at december   we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million within our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
asc also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  
table of contents jurisdictional expansions such as the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino at penn national race course  the property opening in maryland  and the anticipated openings in kansas and ohio and expansions improvements of existing properties 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as the illinois  colorado and pennsylvania smoking bans that became effective on january  
the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in kansas where we anticipate opening a casino through a joint venture in the first half of  in ohio where we have plans to open two casinos  one in toledo in the first half of and the other in columbus in the fourth quarter of  in maryland where we opened hollywood casino perryville on september   the first casino in the state  and in pennsylvania depending on the award of certain open licenses and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as the potential introduction of commercial casinos in kansas  maryland  ohio  and kentucky  an additional gaming license in illinois  and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states 
we also face uncertainty regarding anticipated gaming expansion by a potential competitor in baton rouge  louisiana 
legalized gaming from native american casinos can also have a significant competitive effect

in conjunction with the opening of the new casino riverboat at hollywood casino lawrenceburg  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge for the replaced lawrenceburg vessel of million during the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the anticipated impact of gaming expansion in ohio  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million during the year ended december   as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets associated with the original purchase of hollywood casino lawrenceburg was impaired 
as a result of a decline in our share price  an overall reduction in industry valuations  and property operating performance in the then current economic environment  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million during the year ended december   as we determined that a portion of the value of our goodwill  indefinite life intangible assets and long lived assets was impaired

table of contents in our business  revenue is driven by discretionary consumer spending  which has been adversely impacted by weakened general economic conditions such as  but not limited to  high unemployment levels  low levels of consumer confidence  weakness in the housing market and increased stock market volatility 
as a result  customer spend per visit for the years ended december  and has been at relatively low levels compared to earlier periods 
we have no certain mechanism for determining why consumers choose to spend more or less money at our property from period to period and as such cannot quantify a dollar amount for each factor that impacts our customers spending behaviors 
however  based on our experience  we can generally offer investors some insight into the factors that we believe were likely to account for such changes 
in instances where we believe one factor may have had significantly greater impact than the other factors  we have noted that as well

outlook based on our current level of operations and anticipated earnings growth  we believe that cash generated from operations and cash on hand  together with amounts available under our senior secured credit facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that our anticipated earnings growth will be realized  or that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  including the senior secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes  to retire or redeem the senior subordinated notes when required or to make anticipated capital expenditures 
in addition  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations  greenfield projects  jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under penetrated markets 
if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions  our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements 
our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued guidance to improve disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the guidance specifies that if an entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only

the guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company expects that the adoption of the guidance will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements  in the event that the company acquires companies significant to its operations in the future 
in april  the fasb issued guidance on accruing for jackpot liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities or portions thereof before a jackpot is won if the entity can legally avoid paying that jackpot for example  by removing the gaming machine from the casino floor 
jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot 
this guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
however  the guidance is expected to only affect the accounting for base jackpots  as the guidance uses the same principle that is currently applied by the company to the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption 
the company adopted the guidance as of january   which did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements
