item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
overview meritor  inc formerly arvinmeritor  inc  headquartered in troy  michigan  is a premier global supplier of a broad range of integrated systems  modules and components to original equipment manufacturers oems and the aftermarket for the commercial vehicle  transportation and industrial sectors 
the company serves commercial truck  trailer  off highway  military  bus and coach and other industrial oems and certain aftermarkets 
on march   we announced that we officially changed the company name from arvinmeritor  inc to meritor  inc 
and on that date  began trading our common stock on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol mtor 
our earnings for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior year were improved 
net income for the year ended september  was million compared to million in the prior year 
income from continuing operations in fiscal year was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
sales were  million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to  million in the prior year 
adjusted ebitda see non gaap financial measures below for the fiscal year ended september  was million compared to million in fiscal year the significantly improved adjusted ebitda performance is primarily due to the increased sales compared to the prior year 
although the higher sales volumes resulted in significantly improved operating results  including adjusted ebitda  our financial performance was negatively impacted in fiscal year by higher steel  freight and other premium costs 
also unfavorably impacting our operating results were lower sales for certain military programs 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal year is due to higher investments in working capital  primarily inventory and receivables  as the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets strengthened 
we continue to focus on improving cash flow by maintaining tight controls on global inventory  pursuing working capital improvements  and monitoring capital and discretionary spending 
trends and uncertainties production volumes the following table reflects estimated commercial vehicle production volumes for selected original equipment oe markets based on available sources and management s estimates 
year ended september  estimated commercial vehicle production in thousands north america  heavy duty trucks north america  medium duty trucks united states and canada  trailers western europe  heavy and medium duty trucks south america  heavy and medium duty trucks the pace of the recovery of commercial truck volumes in north america and europe  our largest markets  has been more rapid than previously anticipated 
we expect production volumes in north america to continue to remain at levels experienced during the second half of fiscal year which were higher than they were during the first half  and in europe  to weaken from fiscal year levels 
production volumes in the south america and asia pacific markets have generally returned to levels that are strong by historic standards and are expected to remain at or modestly below these levels 
increasing material costs the price of steel has increased significantly in fiscal year and is expected to remain at these higher prices in the near term 
these steel price increases along with increasing transportation costs  have created pressure on profit margins and could continue to unfavorably impact our financial results in the future 
increases in freight and other material costs were higher than usual due to the steepness in the recovery of commercial vehicle volumes 
while we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major oe manufacturers  the price adjustment programs have tended to lag the increase in steel costs and have generally not contemplated non index related increases in steel costs 
as such  we have been pursuing actions with our customers to address these issues in order to further mitigate the impact of steel costs on our profitability 
we have generally been successful in accelerating our recovery of index related steel price increases and continue to pursue recoveries of other material price increases 
industrial segment profitability industrial segment ebitda in the last twelve months was negatively impacted as production for certain military programs shifted to a new prime contractor during the year 
in addition  current year sales for military programs carried lower margins than previous years 
if government defense spending decreases on selected programs or we are unable to secure new military contracts  it could have a longer term negative impact on our industrial segment  and to a lesser extent on our aftermarket and trailer segment due to relatively lower sales of military service parts 
in addition  even if sales on our military programs do return to historic levels  the level of profitability on these sales is expected to be lower than what we have recognized in recent periods 
industry wide issues our business continues to address a number of other challenging industry wide issues including the following the accelerated ramp up of commercial truck production in north america and other regions and the impact on the ability to support customer demand  volatility in price and availability of steel  components and other commodities  including recent sharp increases in steel prices  disruptions in the financial markets and their impact on the availability and cost of credit  higher energy and transportation costs  consolidation and globalization of oems and their suppliers  and pension and retiree medical health care costs 
other other significant factors that could affect our results and liquidity in fiscal year include ability to work with our commercial truck customers to adjust their demand given the rapid acceleration of production  ability to recover and timing of recovery of steel price and other cost increases from our customers  any unplanned extended shutdowns or production interruptions by us  our customers or our suppliers  a significant deterioration or slowdown in economic activity in the key markets in which we operate  higher than planned price reductions to our customers  potential price increases from our suppliers  additional restructuring actions and the timing and recognition of restructuring charges  higher than planned warranty expenses  including the outcome of known or potential recall campaigns  our ability to implement planned productivity  cost reduction  and other margin improvement initiatives  significant contract awards or losses of existing contracts  impact of currency exchange rate volatility in the markets in which we operate 
lvs divestiture update on january   we completed the sale of our body systems business to an affiliate of inteva products  llc

in addition  certain long lived and current assets of the business were sold to a third party 
at september   all restructuring activities related to this closure were complete 
however  it is possible we could receive claims associated with certain contract cancellations for which we are unable to estimate the costs  if any  at september  the results of operations and cash flows of the eu trailer business are presented in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows  and prior period information has been recast to reflect this presentation 
total sales from eu trailer were approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we have provided information regarding non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures include adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations  adjusted ebitda  free cash flow and free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring payments 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations are defined as reported income or loss from continuing operations and reported diluted earnings or loss per share from continuing operations before restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
adjusted ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures  loss on sale of receivables  restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted income loss from continuing operations are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze ongoing operating performance and entity valuation 
management  the investment community and banking institutions routinely use adjusted ebitda  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting future periods 
in addition  we use segment ebitda as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments 
management believes that free cash flow is useful in analyzing our ability to service and repay debt 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for cash provided by used for operating activities  or other cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of financial position or liquidity 
in addition  these non gaap cash flow measures do not reflect cash used to service debt or cash received from the divestitures of businesses or sales of other assets and thus do not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses 
these non gaap financial measures  as determined and presented by the company  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
set forth below are reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share are reconciled to income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share below in millions  except per share amounts

fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales the following table reflects total company and business segment sales for fiscal years and the reconciliation is intended to reflect the trend in business segment sales and to illustrate the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates  volumes and other factors had on sales 
business segment sales include intersegment sales in millions

industrial sales were  million in fiscal year  up percent from fiscal year the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by million 
excluding the effects of foreign currency  sales increased by million or percent 
the increase in sales was primarily due to higher sales in the asia pacific region  which increased approximately percent from the prior year  and higher sales of products associated with the caiman defense program 
the increases were partially offset by lower sales associated with the family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv defense program as production shifted to a new prime contractor during aftermarket trailer sales were  million in fiscal year  up percent from fiscal year excluding the effects of foreign currency  sales increased by million or percent 
the increase in sales is due to higher sales of our core aftermarket replacement products in regions across the globe and our products for trailer applications 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of our military service parts 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales primarily represents materials  labor and overhead production costs associated with the company s products and production facilities 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  was  million compared to  million in the prior year  representing an increase of percent 
the increase in costs of sales is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes discussed above

global steel prices increased significantly during fiscal year and are expected to remain at or close to these higher levels in the near term 
labor and overhead costs increased by million compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the higher sales volumes  partially offset by lower labor and overhead costs associated with continuous improvement and rationalization of operations

in fiscal year  our effective tax rate was percent compared to percent in the prior year 
generally  we expect our effective tax rate to remain at inflated levels in the near term until we can generate income in certain jurisdictions  primarily in the united states and europe

as discussed previously  we announced the closure of our eu trailer business during the second quarter of fiscal year and ceased all manufacturing operations and use of productive assets prior to september  the eu trailer business has been classified as part of discontinued operations at september  and all prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this presentation 
the following table reflects segment ebitda and ebitda margins for fiscal years and dollars in millions 
segment ebitda segment ebitda margins change change change commercial truck pts industrial pts aftermarket trailer pts segment ebitda pts significant items impacting year over year segment ebitda include the following commercial aftermarket truck industrial trailer total segment ebitda year ended september  higher earnings from unconsolidated affiliates lower variable compensation costs lower pension and retiree medical costs impact of foreign currency exchange rates volume  performance  mix and other  net of cost reductions segment ebitda year ended september  commercial truck segment ebitda was million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
segment ebitda margin increased to percent in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in segment ebitda is attributable to higher commercial truck production volumes in all regions compared to the prior year and higher earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition  segment ebitda was favorably impacted by foreign currency translation  primarily due to the movement in brazilian real compared to the us dollar and net gains of million associated with foreign currency option contracts and lower variable incentive compensation costs in the current fiscal year 
the favorable impact of the higher sales volumes on segment ebitda margin was partially offset by the rising cost of steel and certain other costs to meet current production volumes 
industrial segment ebitda was million in fiscal year  down million compared to the prior year 
segment ebitda margin decreased to percent in fiscal year compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the favorable impact of higher sales in our asia pacific region and caiman defense program was more than offset by lower fmtv military sales compared to the prior year as production shifted to a new prime contractor during in addition  segment ebitda in fiscal year was unfavorably impacted by rising steel and certain other costs 
aftermarket trailer segment ebitda was million in fiscal year  up million compared to the prior fiscal year 
segment ebitda margin increased to percent in the current fiscal year compared to percent in fiscal year the increase in segment ebitda and segment ebitda margin is due to the favorable impact of a number of factors  including higher sales in our core aftermarket products  higher sales of products for trailer applications  lower variable compensation costs and the impact of foreign currency translation  partially offset by rising steel costs 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales the following table reflects total company and business segment sales for fiscal years and the reconciliation is intended to reflect the trend in business segment sales and to illustrate the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates  volumes and other factors had on sales in millions

excluding the effects of foreign currency  sales increased by million or percent  reflecting higher oe production volumes in all regions 
many of our customers experienced sharp declines in production and sales volumes in fiscal year  which started in november and continued throughout our fiscal year we saw varying levels of improvement in fiscal year from low points 
production volumes in south america strengthened significantly in fiscal year reaching record levels 
industrial sales were million in fiscal year  up percent from fiscal year the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by million 
the increase in sales was due to higher sales in our china off highway operations and india commercial vehicle operations  which increased by approximately percent compared to fiscal year these increases were largely offset by significantly lower sales in our military products primarily associated with the mine resistant ambush protection program mrap during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we substantially completed mrap deliveries in fiscal year and did not receive any significant new orders in fiscal year aftermarket trailer sales were million in fiscal year  up percent from fiscal year the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales were relatively flat compared to fiscal year sales of our military service parts  primarily associated with the mrap military applications  were down significantly compared to fiscal year the impact of this sales decline was fully offset by higher sales of core aftermarket replacement parts and products for trailer applications 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales primarily represents materials  labor and overhead production costs associated with the company s products and production facilities 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  was  million compared to  million in the prior year  representing an increase of percent 
the increase in costs of sales is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes discussed above 
total cost of sales were approximately percent of sales for the fiscal year ended september  compared to approximately percent for fiscal year the decrease on a percentage basis is primarily due to improvements in our fixed cost base and ongoing programs to optimize labor  burden and material costs  partially offset by commodity increases  namely steel 
as previously mentioned  we aggressively lowered our break even point throughout fiscal year through comprehensive restructuring and structural cost reduction initiatives

improvements in material performance compared to fiscal year positively impacted the total cost of sales in fiscal year labor and overhead costs increased by million compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the higher sales volumes 
other factors favorably impacting labor and overhead costs were savings associated with our restructuring actions  continuous improvement and rationalization of operations  as well as government assistance programs related to labor in certain european jurisdictions that were enacted in and partially carried over to as a result of the above  gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  was million compared to million in fiscal year gross margins increased to percent for the fiscal year ended september  compared to percent fiscal year other income statement items selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years and are summarized as follows in millions increase decrease of of amount sales amount sales sg a loss on sale of receivables pts short and long term variable compensation pts all other sg a pts total sg a pts in fiscal year  we eliminated substantially all variable incentive compensation pay based on the financial results for that fiscal year

all other sg a represents normal selling  general and administrative expenses 
all other sg a expense decreased as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal year despite the discontinuance of certain temporary salary and benefit reductions implemented during fiscal year this decrease in normal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is a result of savings associated with various restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives  including reduced discretionary spending  and headcount reductions implemented in fiscal year restructuring costs incurred by our business segments during fiscal years and are as follows in millions commercial truck industrial total performance plus actions fiscal year actions reduction in workforce total restructuring costs total segment restructuring costs do not include those recorded in unallocated corporate costs

included in interest expense  net for fiscal year is a net loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million 
the loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the million paid in excess of par to repurchase million of the percent notes due in  partially offset by a million gain associated with the acceleration of a pro rata share of previously recognized unamortized interest rate swap gains associated with the percent notes 
this pro rata share of the interest rate swap gains was being amortized into income as reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the notes 
favorably impacting interest expense  net in fiscal year was a million gain on the collection of a note receivable from the sale of our emissions technologies business in fiscal year this gain primarily related to the acceleration of the discount on the note and early collection triggered by a change in control 
the discount on the note was previously being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the note 
the remaining increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional interest cost associated with our debt securities issued during the fiscal year provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year income tax expense for fiscal years and was unfavorably impacted by losses in certain tax jurisdictions where tax benefits are no longer recognized 
the tax provision in fiscal year also includes non cash income tax charges of million related to establishing valuation allowances on certain previously recognized deferred tax assets  primarily in the us and france  as well as other countries
