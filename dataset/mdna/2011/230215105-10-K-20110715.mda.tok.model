item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes attached thereto 
general our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the sunday closest to april fiscal and each included weeks and fiscal included weeks 
our operations are classified into two business segments mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics 
the mattress fabrics segment manufactures  sources  and sells fabrics to bedding manufacturers 
the upholstery fabrics segment sources  manufacturers and sells fabrics primarily to residential and commercial contract furniture manufacturers 
we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges credits  certain unallocated corporate expenses  and other non recurring items 
cost of sales in both segments include costs to manufacture or source our products  including costs such as raw material and finished goods purchases  direct and indirect labor  overhead and incoming freight charges 
unallocated corporate expenses primarily represent compensation and benefits for certain executive officers and all costs related to being a public company 
segment assets include assets used in the operation of each segment and primarily consist of accounts receivable  inventories  and property  plant and equipment 
the mattress fabrics segment also includes in segment assets  assets held for sale  goodwill  and non compete agreements associated with certain acquisitions 
the upholstery fabrics segment also includes assets held for sale in segment assets 
executive summary we reported net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of  compared with million for fiscal this increase represents the second consecutive net sales increase since the recession began in also  we reported net sales of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of  compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal is the highest quarterly net sales in three years 
these results reflect favorable growth trends as a result of a stronger competitive position in both our business segments and price increases we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially offset increased raw material costs and customer pricing pressure 
although we have experienced favorable sales growth  we do not expect net sales to grow significantly in the near future due to macro economic trends  including a weak housing market  high unemployment  and a shortage of consumer credit 
we reported income before income taxes of million in fiscal  an increase of compared with million in fiscal this increase represents the increase in net sales noted above and the benefits of a leaner and more cost efficient operating platform 
despite the increases in sales and pre tax income  our profit margins were affected by significant increases in our raw material costs and customer selling price pressures experienced in both our business segments 
as mentioned above  we announced customer price increases in both business segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially offset these increased costs experienced in fiscal these customer price increases are not expected to fully restore our reduced operating profit margins 
also  this increase in income before income taxes reflects a decrease in our selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease primarily pertains to i a decrease in stock based compensation expense which reflects a decrease in stock based awards and the company s stock price  ii a decrease in incentive bonus accruals reflecting weaker financial results in relation to pre established performance targets  and iii a decrease in bad debt expense reflecting management s assessment of estimated credit exposures within our accounts receivable portfolio 
lastly  our increase in income before income taxes reflects a decrease in other expense from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease reflects fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate for our subsidiaries domiciled in canada and china and our ability to maintain a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars during fiscal although we will try to maintain this natural hedge  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in future reporting periods 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net income for fiscal included a million income tax benefit and net income for fiscal included income tax expense of million 
the income tax benefit in fiscal includes a non cash reversal of valuation allowances against our us and china net deferred tax assets relating to future earnings totaling million 
despite ongoing economic uncertainties  we have maintained a strong financial position and generated significant cash flow during fiscal our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at may   compared with million at may   an increase of million 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance of million exceeded our total debt current maturities of long term debt and long term debt of million and represents of shareholders equity 
our next major scheduled long term debt principal payment of million is due august as of may   our lines of credit totaling million had no outstanding balances 
all of our long term debt and line of credit agreements are unsecured 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million 
after several years of high levels of capital expenditures averaging million per year over the last seven fiscal years  we are expecting significantly lower capital spending in the foreseeable future 
we are currently planning for capital expenditures of million in fiscal our shareholders equity was million at may   an increase of from million at may   and an increase of from million at may  in the third quarter of fiscal  we have established a wholly owned subsidiary in poland  called culp europe 
we plan for this operation to sell and distribute fabrics and manufacture and sell cut and sewn kits in europe  using fabrics primarily sourced from our china platform and other direct suppliers 
our sales and marketing efforts in europe also include a program for shipping containers of fabric and cut and sewn kits directly from our operations located in china to customers in europe 
this operation is still in its early stages  as sales activities commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal on june   our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
under the common stock repurchase program  shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions  block trades  and through plans established under the securities exchange act rule b the amount of shares purchased and the timing of such purchases will be based on working capital requirements  market and general business conditions and other factors including alternative investment opportunities

mattress fabrics net sales are not expected to grow significantly in the near future due to the macro economic trends related to a weak housing market  high unemployment  and a shortage of consumer credit  which tend to depress demand for bedding products 
gross profit and operating income gross profit was million in fiscal  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal sg a expenses for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal operating income was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in fiscal operating margins were and of net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
although net sales increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  gross profit and operating income decreased by and  respectively 
this trend in profitability is primarily due to increased competitive pricing pressure and higher raw material costs that we began to experience in the second quarter of fiscal although we are beginning to see some stabilization in raw material costs  these costs remain significantly higher than a year earlier 
in response to these increased costs  we announced small customer price increases in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have taken steps to re engineer products and yarns where possible without sacrificing quality  and enhance production efficiencies 
during fiscal  we completed a multi year expansion of our mattress fabrics business which included the expansion of internal production capacity for our knitted fabrics product line  our fastest growing product category  and the completion of an energy initiative in our canadian operation that we expect to have an environmental benefit and reduce future operating costs 
the total investment for this multi year expansion was million  which included million in capital expenditures and million spent for two successful acquisitions 
as a result of these investments  we believe we are well positioned with a large and modern vertically integrated manufacturing platform in woven and knitted fabrics  the two major product categories of the mattress fabrics industry  which has allowed us to substantially improve our supply logistics from pattern inception to fabric delivery 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  assets held for sale  non compete agreements associated with certain acquisitions  goodwill  and property  plant and equipment 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at may  this change reflects the net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal noted above

the million represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the million represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the increase in this segment s property  plant  and equipment balance at may  compared with may   is primarily due to fiscal capital spending of million offset by depreciation expense of million 
at may   and may   the carrying value of the segment s goodwill was million 
at may   and may   the carrying value of our non compete agreements were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the carrying values of the non compete agreements during fiscal primarily represents amortization expense 
at may   and may   assets held for sale totaled  and  respectively 
upholstery fabrics segment net sales upholstery fabric net sales which include both fabric and cut and sewn kits were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of 
also  we reported net sales of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal was the highest quarterly net sales in fiscal this increase in net sales reflects favorable growth trends as a result of a stronger competitive position and price increases we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal that were used to partially offset increased raw material costs  and a significant increase in the provision for returns  allowances  and discounts in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal although we experienced favorable sales growth in this segment during the past two years  we do not expect net sales to grow significantly in the near future due to unfavorable macro economic trends such as a continuing weak housing market  high unemployment  and a shortage of consumer credit 
our upholstery fabric net sales continue to be driven by our operations located in china  accounting for and of total upholstery fabric net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
net sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside our us manufacturing operations were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal net sales of us produced upholstery fabrics were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal these trends represent our continued shift toward production outside our us manufacturing operations and are the result of our long term strategy to build a wholly owned and low cost business located in china that is scalable  and not capital intensive 
our china produced products have been traditionally sold to our us customers 
however  we are continuing to look for opportunities to expand our sales of china produced products to both the local china market and other international customers 
european sales and marketing initiatives in the third quarter of fiscal  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in poland  called culp europe 
we plan for this operation to sell and distribute fabrics and manufacture and sell cut and sewn kits in europe  using fabrics primarily sourced from our china platform and other direct suppliers 
our sales and marketing efforts in europe also include a program for shipping containers of fabric and cut and sewn kits directly from our operations located in china to customers in europe 
this operation is still in its early stages  as sales activities commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal we previously announced in the third quarter of fiscal our plans to establish a joint venture in the united kingdom to sell and distribute upholstery fabrics throughout the uk however  with the significant opportunities for our culp europe operation in poland and the internal resources required to build that business  we have decided to pursue the uk market through a more traditional customer supplier approach rather than a joint venture 
while we are optimistic about the market opportunities in the uk  our primary focus in europe for fiscal will be on our sales and marketing efforts with our culp europe subsidiary 
gross profit and operating income gross profit was million in fiscal  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal sg a expenses were million for both fiscal and operating income was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in fiscal operating margins were and of net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
although net sales increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  gross profit and operating income decreased by and  respectively 
this trend in profitability is primarily due to higher raw material costs which began to increase in the second quarter of fiscal and weaker operating performance of our one remaining us facility as compared to the prior year 
our one remaining us facility experienced weaker performance in fiscal due to the higher raw material costs as mentioned above and a decrease in net sales of 
although we are beginning to see some stabilization in raw material costs  these costs remain significantly higher than a year earlier 
in response to these increased costs  the upholstery segment announced customer price increases in the fourth quarter of fiscal and also took steps to re engineer products and yarns where possible without sacrificing quality  and enhance production efficiencies 
segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale 
as of may   and may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million

other income statement categories selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for the company as a whole were million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal  a decrease of 
this decrease primarily pertains to i a decrease in stock based compensation expense reflecting a decrease in stock based awards and the company s stock price  ii a decrease in incentive bonus accruals reflecting weaker financial results in relation to pre established performance targets  and iii a decrease in bad debt expense reflecting management s assessment of estimated credit exposures within its accounts receivable portfolio 
interest expense income interest expense was  for fiscal compared with million for fiscal this trend reflects lower outstanding balances on our long term debt 
interest income was  in fiscal compared with  for fiscal our increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances during fiscal compared with fiscal  and a higher rate of return in fiscal on short term investment purchases that did not commence until the third quarter of fiscal other expense other expense was  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal this decrease reflects fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate for our subsidiaries domiciled in canada and china and our ability to maintain a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars during fiscal although  we will try to maintain this natural hedge  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in future reporting periods 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by asc topic  income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
effective income tax rate we recorded an income tax benefit of million  or of income before income tax expense in fiscal compared with income tax expense of million  or of income before income tax expense  in fiscal the income tax benefit for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by or an income tax benefit of million was recorded for the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us and china operations 
this income tax benefit of million represents a million realization of us loss carryforwards associated with fiscal pre tax income from our us operations  a million adjustment pertaining to a change in judgment about the future realization of our us net deferred tax assets  and a million adjustment pertaining to a change in judgment about the future realization of our china net deferred tax assets 
the income tax rate was reduced by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate was reduced by for adjustments made to our canadian deferred tax liabilities associated with our election to file our canadian income tax returns in us dollars commencing with our fiscal tax year 
our canadian income tax returns were filed in canadian dollars for fiscal years prior to fiscal this adjustment totaled  and represented a discrete event in which the full tax effects were recorded in the first quarter and the full year of fiscal the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for non deductible stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous items 
income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by for the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets associated with our us and china operations 
this reduction in our valuation allowance was primarily due to us taxable income generated by the repatriation of undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries located in china and the resulting usage of us net operating loss carryforwards 
also  this reduction pertains to the realization on and projected realization of deferred tax assets created from tax versus book depreciation associated with the company s china operations 
the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar was very volatile due to changes in oil prices and global economic conditions 
in order to mitigate our exposure to the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar and its impact on our income tax provision  we elected to file our canadian tax returns in us dollars commencing with our fiscal tax year 
the income tax rate was reduced by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased for the recording of a deferred tax liability for estimated us income taxes that were paid upon repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company s subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for non deductible stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous items 
deferred income taxes in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment at may   we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
at may   no valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations 
united states our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily pertains to incurring significant us pre tax losses in prior years  with us loss carryforwards totaling million at may  due to the favorable results of our multi year restructuring process in our upholstery fabric operations and key acquisitions and capital investments made for our mattress fabric segment  on a cumulative three year basis ending may   our us operations have earned a pre tax income of million 
in addition  our us operations reported a pre tax income over the last fiscal years fiscal and totaling million 
we believe that fiscal years and are a more indicative measure of future pre tax income as these fiscal years reflect operating performance after the cost savings of the profit improvement and restructuring plans were realized and the full operational effects of the acquisitions associated with the company s mattress fabric operations located in the us although our us operations have reported pre tax income on a cumulative three year basis  the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  have made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations 
based on current economic conditions  we believe it is too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our us operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against the net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that is expected to reverse beyond fiscal  and we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for projected us taxable income in fiscal that is expected to reduce our us loss carryforwards 
china our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operation s fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to be realized  our china operations must have sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
during fiscal  management assessed both positive and negative evidence and concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our net deferred tax assets regarding our china operations will more likely than not be realized 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations have been profitable  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal and fiscal in addition  our china operations earned pre tax income of million over a cumulative three year period ending may  as a result of the improvement of our china operations pre tax income levels that have been demonstrated over a cumulative period of three years  there was sufficient positive evidence that our china operations can provide sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
based on this significant positive evidence  we did not record a valuation allowance against our china net deferred tax assets at may  during fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million to reduce the valuation allowance of million recorded at may  the beginning of fiscal 
income taxes paid income tax payments  net of income tax refunds  were million in  million in  and  in fiscal see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
compared with segment analysis mattress fabrics segment net sales for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported net sales of million compared with million for fiscal in contrast to the small year over year decline  mattress fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase in the fourth quarter reflected significant improvement in consumer demand in the bedding industry in early calendar and the closure of a key competitor in late calendar gross profit and operating income the mattress fabrics segment reported gross profit of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal the mattress fabrics segment reported operating income of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal despite net sales remaining relatively the same in fiscal compared with  gross profit margins increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal also  operating income margins increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal our improved performance in our mattress fabric segment reflected the benefits of the ongoing investments we made to develop an efficient and scalable manufacturing platform 
these investments included significant capital spending and the bodet horst acquisition made in august our improved operating performance in fiscal also reflected lower raw material prices obtained from our global sourcing strategy 
however  as noted above we experienced significant increases in our raw material prices in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  in fiscal compared with million in fiscal segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  assets held for sale  non compete agreements associated with certain acquisitions  goodwill  and property  plant and equipment 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at may  this change reflects the net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal noted above 
at may   and may   this segment had assets held for sale with carrying values totaling  and  respectively 
at may   and may   the carrying value of our non compete agreements were  and million  respectively 
the decrease in the carrying values of our non compete agreements during fiscal primarily represents amortization expense 
at may   and may  the carrying value of the segment s goodwill was million and million  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we finalized our valuation of the fair values for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the bodet horst acquisition 
as a result of this final valuation  we recorded an adjustment to increase the fair value of the associated non compete agreement and reduce the fair value of goodwill by  at may   and may   property  plant and equipment totaled million and million  respectively 
the million represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the million balance at may   represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the increase in this segment s property  plant  and equipment balance at may   compared with may   is primarily due to fiscal capital spending of million  offset by depreciation expense of million 
bodet horst asset acquisition pursuant to an asset purchase agreement among the company  bodet horst usa  lp and bodet horst gmbh co 
kg collectively bodet horst dated august   the company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the knitted mattress fabric operation of bodet horst  including its manufacturing operation in high point  north carolina 
this purchase has allowed the company to have a vertically integrated manufacturing platform in all major product categories of the mattress fabrics industry 
the purchase involved the equipment  inventory  and intellectual property associated with the high point manufacturing operation  which had served as the company s primary source of knitted mattress fabric prior to the acquisition 
demand for this product line has grown significantly  as knits are increasingly being utilized on mattresses at volume retail price points 
the purchase price for the assets was cash in the amount of million  which included an adjustment of  for changes in working capital as defined in the asset purchase agreement  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
also  in connection with the purchase  the company entered into a six year consulting and non compete agreement with the principal owner of bodet horst  providing for payments to the owner in the amount of  per year to be paid in quarterly installments of which  and  will be allocated to the non compete covenant and consulting fees  respectively for the agreement s full six year term 
the acquisition was financed by million of unsecured notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated august  during the first quarter of fiscal  we finalized our valuation of the fair values for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed regarding this purchase 
as a result of this final valuation  we recorded an adjustment to increase the fair value of the non compete agreement and reduce the fair value of the goodwill by  the following table presents the final allocation of the acquisition cost  including professional fees and other related acquisition costs  to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
dollars in thousands fair value inventories other current assets property  plant  and equipment non compete agreement note goodwill accounts payable the total consideration paid was million  with  and  being paid in fiscal and  respectively 
we recorded the non compete agreement at its fair value based on various valuation techniques 
this non compete agreement will be amortized on a straight line basis over the six year life of the agreement 
property  plant  and equipment will be depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives ranging from five to fifteen years 
goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes over the statutory period of fifteen years

upholstery fabrics segment net sales upholstery fabric net sales which include both fabric and cut and sewn kits were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of 
in addition  upholstery fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal as noted below  the increase in net sales reflected our focus in fiscal on product development  sales and marketing initiatives  delivery performance  and aggressively defending our copyrights 
in addition  fiscal net sales were affected by the planned discontinuation of certain us products as part of our profit improvement plan implemented in fiscal  and a significant increase in the provision for returns  allowances  and discounts 
net sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside our us manufacturing operations were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal net sales produced outside our us manufacturing operations represented of total upholstery fabric net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal net sales of us produced upholstery fabrics were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal these trends represent our continued shift toward production outside our us manufacturing operations and are the result of our long term strategy to build a wholly owned and low cost business located in china that is scalable  and not capital intensive 
gross profit and operating income loss the upholstery fabrics segment reported gross profit of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal this significant improvement in gross profit led to operating income of million in fiscal compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal  representing a million turnaround 
the substantial improvement in the upholstery fabric segment s gross profit and operating income reflected the increase in net sales noted above and the incremental benefits of our restructuring activities and the profit improvement plan completed in fiscal this improvement also reflected our continued shift toward production outside our us manufacturing operations and to build a wholly owned and low cost business located in china that is scalable  and not capital intensive 
due to our improved operating results  we were able to shift our focus in fiscal to product development  sales and marketing initiatives  and delivery performance 
lastly  in fiscal we began efforts to aggressively defend our design copyrights and have taken action to protect our creativity  and we believe these efforts are helping us retain and grow sales of certain upholstery fabrics 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at may  this change reflects the net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal noted above

during the second quarter of fiscal  assets with a carrying value of  were reclassified from held for sale see below paragraph 
as of may   the upholstery fabrics segment reported no carrying value associated with its property  plant  and equipment due to impairment charges incurred in fiscal see restructuring section below and the classification of property  plant  and equipment as assets held for sale 
at may  and may   this segment had assets held for sale with a carrying value of  and million  respectively 
due to the favorable results from our profit improvement plan and restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  management assessed the classification of upholstery fabric assets classified as held for sale during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of this assessment  upholstery fabric assets with a carrying value of  were reclassified from assets held for sale to held and used included in property  plant  and equipment on the may  consolidated balance sheet 
this carrying value of  represents these assets carrying amount before being classified as held for sale during the third quarter of fiscal adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recognized had these assets been classified as held and used  which is lower than these assets fair value at the date they were reclassified to held and used during the second quarter of fiscal 
consequently we recorded a charge totaling  in the second quarter of fiscal to depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring and related charges credits during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and related credit of  of which a credit of  was for employee termination benefits  a credit of  was for sales proceeds received on equipment with no carrying value  a credit of  was for inventory markdowns  a credit of  was for lease termination and other exit costs  offset by a charge of  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total credit  a charge of  was recorded to cost of sales and a credit of  was recorded to restructuring credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  total restructuring and related charges incurred were million  of which million was for write downs of equipment and buildings  million for inventory markdowns   for employee termination benefits   for lease termination and other exit costs  and  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of these total charges  million was recorded in cost of sales   was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and million was recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
of these total charges  million and million represent non cash and cash charges  respectively 
a detailed explanation of each of our significant restructuring plans for fiscal and is presented below 
september upholstery fabrics on september   our board of directors approved changes to the upholstery fabric operations  including the consolidation of plant facilities in china and the reduction of excess manufacturing capacity 
these actions were in response to the extremely challenging industry conditions for upholstery fabrics 
the plant closings associated with this restructuring plan have been completed 
during fiscal  a restructuring credit of  was recorded for lease termination and other exit costs 
this  credit was recorded to restructuring credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  restructuring and related charges totaled million  of which million related to impairment charges on equipment and leasehold improvements  million for accelerated depreciation   for inventory markdowns   for lease termination and other exit costs   for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities  and  for employee termination benefits 
the million accelerated depreciation charge represents the incremental depreciation expense to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations ceased 
of this total charge  million and million were recorded in restructuring expense and cost of sales  respectively  in the consolidated statement of operations 
december upholstery fabrics on december   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment to consolidate the company s us upholstery fabrics manufacturing facilities and outsource its specialty yarn production 
this process involved closing the company s weaving plant located in graham  north carolina  and closing the yarn plant located in lincolnton  north carolina 
we transferred certain production from the graham plant to our anderson  south carolina and shanghai  china plant facilities as well as a small portion to contract weavers 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring credit of  the  represents a credit of  for employee termination benefits  a credit of  for sales proceeds received for equipment with no carrying value  a credit of  for inventory markdowns  offset by a charge of  for lease termination and other exit costs  and a charge of  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this  restructuring credit  a credit of  was recorded in restructuring credit and a credit of  was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  we further assessed the net realizable value of our inventory  recoverability of our property  plant  and equipment  and selling  general  and administrative expenses based on demand trends related to our us upholstery fabric operations 
this assessment was required based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the depressed housing market  credit crisis  and decreased consumer spending that developed in the second quarter of fiscal  and which was more severe than we anticipated at the end of fiscal as a result  restructuring and related charges incurred were million  of which million related to impairment charges on a building and equipment   related to inventory markdowns   related to employee termination benefits   related to lease termination and other exit costs  and  related to other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total charge  million was recorded in restructuring expense   was recorded in cost of sales  and  was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
long lived asset impairments during fiscal  we did not incur any impairment charges regarding our upholstery fabric property  plant  and equipment 
during fiscal  we incurred impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment in connection with our restructuring activities 
these impairment charges totaled million and were recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million impairment charge included million for fixed assets that were abandoned in connection with the consolidation of certain plant facilities in china and  to reflect the million selling price of the company s corporate headquarters 
also  during the course of the company s strategic review in the second quarter of fiscal of its upholstery fabrics business  we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of our upholstery fabric fixed assets that were being held and used in operations 
this strategic review resulted in impairment losses of million and  for fixed assets located in china and the us  respectively 
in addition  we incurred impairment losses totaling  for assets held for sale associated with our u 
s upholstery fabric operations 
these losses reflect the amounts by which the carrying values of these fixed assets exceeded their estimated fair values determined by their estimated future discounted cash flows and quoted market prices 
other income statement categories selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a for the company as a whole were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase in sg a expenses primarily pertained to an increase in stock based compensation expense reflecting an increase in the company s stock price and an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of significantly improved financial performance 
interest expense income interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this trend reflected lower outstanding balances on our long term debt 
interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase reflected our higher cash and short term investment balances in fiscal compared with other expense other expense for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal this change primarily reflected fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for our subsidiary domiciled in canada 
as a result of our increased cash and short term investment position in fiscal  we tried to maintain a natural hedge by keeping an equal balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  other expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million  or of income before income tax expense  in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million  or of loss before income tax expense in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by for the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets associated with our us and china operations 
this reduction in our valuation allowance was primarily due to us taxable income generated by the repatriation of undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries located in china and the resulting usage of us net operating loss carryforwards 
also  this reduction pertained to the realization on and projected realization of deferred tax assets created from tax versus book depreciation associated with the company s china operations 
the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar was very volatile due to changes in oil prices and global economic conditions 
in order to mitigate our exposure to the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar and its impact on our income tax provision  we elected to file our canadian income tax returns in us dollars commencing with our fiscal tax year 
the income tax rate was reduced by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased for the recording of a deferred tax liability for estimated us income taxes that were paid upon repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company s subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for non deductible stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous items

handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment  and lease expense 
had these costs been included in cost of sales  gross profit would have been million or  in fiscal  million  or  in fiscal  and million  or  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit lines 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operations and capital expenditures 
we believe our present cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance of million  cash flow from operations  and current availability under our unsecured revolving credit lines will be sufficient to fund our business needs and fiscal contractual obligations see below commitments table 
despite the ongoing economic uncertainties  we have maintained a strong financial position and generated significant cash flow in fiscal our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at may   an increase of million from million at may   and an increase of million from million at may  this trend represents strong cash flow from operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our cash flow from operations in fiscal and reflected net income which was partially offset by significant cash capital expenditures of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily pertained to our investment in our mattress fabrics segment 
in addition  we had long term debt payments totaling million  of which million represented our last principal payment in march on our prior unsecured term notes 
lastly  we received cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance of million exceeded our total debt current maturities of long term debt and long term debt of million at the end of fiscal and represents of shareholders equity 
our next major scheduled long term debt principal payment of million is due august as of may   our lines of credit totaling million had no outstanding balances 
all of our long term debt and line of credit agreements are unsecured 
after several years of high levels of capital expenditures totaling million the last two fiscal years  which primarily pertained to our mattress fabrics segment  we are expecting significantly lower capital spending in the foreseeable future 
we are currently planning for capital expenditures of million in fiscal  which primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
our shareholders equity was million at may   an increase of from million at may   and an increase of from million at may  as a result of our strong financial position  on june   our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
under the common stock repurchase program  shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions  block trades  and through plans established under the securities exchange act rule b the amount of shares purchased and the timing of such purchases will be based on working capital requirements  market and general business conditions and other factors including alternative investment opportunities 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control  such as weakening industry demand and delays in receipt of payment on accounts receivable 
working capital accounts receivable at may   were million compared with million  at may  days sales in receivables were days and days at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inventories at may  were million  an increase of  compared with million at may  this increase was mainly due to higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal inventory turns for fiscal were versus for fiscal accounts payable trade as of may  were million  an increase of  compared with million at may  this increase primarily reflects our increase in inventory noted above 
operating working capital comprised of accounts receivable and inventories  less accounts payable trade and capital expenditures was million at may   compared with million at may  operating working capital turnover was in fiscal compared to in fiscal financing arrangements unsecured term notes in connection with the bodet horst acquisition note  we entered into a note agreement dated august  this agreement provided for the issuance of million of unsecured term notes with a fixed interest rate of and a term of seven years 
principal payments of million per year are due on the notes beginning august  the principal payments are payable over an average term of years through august  the agreement contains customary financial and other covenants as defined in the agreement 
government of quebec loan we have an agreement with the government of quebec for a term loan that is non interest bearing and is payable in equal monthly installments denominated in canadian dollars that commenced on december  the proceeds were used to partially finance capital expenditures at our rayonese facility located in quebec  canada 
revolving credit agreement united states we have an unsecured revolving credit agreement that currently provides for a loan commitment of million  including letters of credit of up to million

as of may   there were  in outstanding letters of credit all of which related to workers compensation 
at may  and may   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
on august   we entered into the sixteenth amendment to this revolving credit agreement  which increased the annual capital expenditure limit from million to million in each of fiscal years and revolving credit agreement china we have an unsecured credit agreement for our chinese operations that provides for a line of credit up to approximately million and expires on september  this agreement bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
there were no borrowings under this agreement as of may  and may  overall our loan agreements require  among other things  that we maintain compliance with certain financial covenants 
at may   the company was in compliance with these financial covenants 
the principal payment requirements for long term debt during the next five fiscal years are million  million  million  million  and million

at may   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
as a result of these inherent uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payment of these amounts 
of the million in total gross unrecognized tax benefits  million would not be subject to cash payments due to the company s us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
capital expenditures capital expenditures on a cash basis were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these capital expenditures for fiscal and primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
depreciation expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation expense for fiscal and primarily pertained to our mattress fabrics segment 
after several years of high levels of capital expenditures totaling million the last two fiscal years  we are expecting significantly lower capital spending in the foreseeable future 
we are currently planning for capital expenditures of million in fiscal  which primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
for fiscal  we currently expect depreciation expense to be approximately million  which primarily relates to our mattress fabrics segment 
accounts payable capital expenditures at may   we had total amounts due regarding capital expenditures totaling  which pertain to outstanding vendor invoices  none of which are financed 
inflation any significant increase in our raw material costs  utility energy costs and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  because competitive conditions have limited our ability to pass significant operating increases on to customers 
as discussed elsewhere in this report see segment analysis  significant increases in raw material costs led to lower profit margins for both of our business segments during fiscal critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of may   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of may   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
one customer within the upholstery fabrics segment represented of consolidated accounts receivable at may  no customers within the mattress fabrics segment represented more than of consolidated accounts receivable at may  we continuously perform credit evaluations of our customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that we could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was  and million at may  and may   respectively 
inventory valuation 
we operate as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory and the planned discontinuance of certain patterns 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
we also provide inventory valuation write downs based on the planned discontinuance of certain products based on the current market values at that time as compared to their current carrying values 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
goodwill 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying values 
at the end of fiscal  we tested for impairment of goodwill utilizing a two step approach 
in the first step  we estimated the fair market values of its reporting units mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics using a combination of the income approach and market approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to our market capitalization at the date of valuation 
we used a discount rate equal to our average cost of funds to discount the expected future cash flows 
if the fair market value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit was considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step the implied fair market value of the goodwill would be estimated as the fair market value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair market value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
based on the results of the fiscal impairment test  no impairment of goodwill was incurred and the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary 
the company s goodwill at may   of million relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
although we believe we have based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income loss in the period that includes the enactment date 
in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment at may   we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
at may   no valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily pertains to incurring significant us pre tax losses in prior years  with us loss carryforwards totaling million at may  due to the favorable results of our multi year restructuring process in our upholstery fabric operations and key acquisitions and capital investments made for our mattress fabric segment  on a cumulative three year basis ending may   our us operations have earned a pre tax income of million 
in addition  our us operations reported a pre tax income over the last fiscal years fiscal and totaling million 
we believe that fiscal years and are a more indicative measure of future pre tax income as these fiscal years reflect operating performance after the cost savings of the profit improvement and restructuring plans were realized and the full operational effects of the acquisitions associated with the company s mattress fabric operations located in the us although our us operations have reported pre tax income on a cumulative three year basis  the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  have made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations 
based on current economic conditions  we believe it is too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our us operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against the net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that is expected to reverse beyond fiscal and we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for projected us taxable income in fiscal that is expected to reduce our us loss carryforwards 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operation s fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to be realized  our china operations must have sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
during fiscal  management assessed both positive and negative evidence and concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our net deferred tax assets regarding our china operations will more likely than not be realized 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations have been profitable  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal and fiscal in addition  our china operations earned pre tax income of million over a cumulative three year period ending may  as a result of the improvement of our china operations pre tax income levels that have been demonstrated over a cumulative period of three years  there was sufficient positive evidence that our china operations can provide sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
based on this significant positive evidence  we did not to record a valuation allowance against our china net deferred tax assets at may  during fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit of million to reduce the valuation allowance of million recorded at may  the beginning of fiscal 
in accordance with asc topic  we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
at may   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements for fiscal recently issued accounting standards refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our revolving credit lines 
at may   our us revolving credit agreement provides for a pricing matrix to determine the interest rate payable on loans made under this agreement 
our revolving credit line associated with our china subsidiaries bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
at may   there were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit lines 
we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
our unsecured term notes have a fixed interest rate of and the loan associated with the government of quebec is non interest bearing 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for our subsidiaries domiciled in china  canada  and poland 
on january   we entered into a canadian dollar foreign exchange contract associated with our loan from the government of quebec 
the agreement effectively converted the canadian dollar principal debt payments at a fixed canadian dollar foreign exchange rate versus the united states dollar of 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we elected to terminate this contract due to the favorable canadian dollar foreign exchange rates in comparison to the fixed contractual rate noted above 
additionally  we try to maintain a natural hedge by keeping an equal balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries domiciled in canada  although there is no assurance that we will be able to continually maintain this natural hedge 
our foreign subsidiaries use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
a substantial portion of our imports purchased outside the united states are denominated in us dollars 
a change in either exchange rate at may   would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position
