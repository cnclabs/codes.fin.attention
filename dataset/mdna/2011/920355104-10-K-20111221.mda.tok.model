item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview the valspar corporation is a global leader in the paint and coatings industry 
with fiscal year sales of  and more than  employees in over countries  we believe we are the sixth largest paint and coatings company in the world 
our strong consumer brands and leading technologies  together with our technical expertise and customer service  differentiate us from our competition and allow us to grow and create value with customers in a wide variety of geographic and end use markets 
our fundamental business objective is to create long term value for our shareholders 
we accomplish this by focusing on helping our customers succeed  investing in brands and technologies  expanding our global presence  maintaining operational discipline  productivity improvement and prudent cost control  generating strong cash flow  and optimizing our allocation of capital to maintain and grow the business  increase dividends  fund internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions  and repurchase shares 
in addition to delivering sound financial results and creating value for our shareholders  we are committed to adhering to our values  ethical business conduct and doing business with integrity  improving our safety and environmental performance  and building our reputation by supporting the communities where we work and live through volunteer efforts and philanthropy 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in the context of this overview 
general economic and industry wide factors general economic conditions remain challenging 
the recovery in the paint and coatings industry has been slow and us volumes are still below levels 
the us housing markets have not recovered to historic levels and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  certain markets where valspar has a strong presence  including asia and latin america  continued to grow 
in fiscal year  we experienced a significant increase in raw material costs  along with shortages of certain raw materials  reflecting ongoing volatility in the chemical industry 
we expect some raw material inflation in fiscal year  but not at the significant levels we experienced in fiscal year despite challenging economic conditions and higher raw material costs  we made solid progress on our long term growth initiatives by continuing to invest in our brands and technologies  which enabled us to obtain new business and achieve consistent gains in consumer awareness of the valspar brand in the us and the huarun brand in china 
continuing to invest in strategic acquisitions that further expand our presence in fast growing coatings markets and improve the geographic diversity of our portfolio 
in february  we acquired isocoat tintas e vernizes ltda 
isocoat  a brazilian based manufacturer of powder coatings serving appliance  building products  transportation and other general industrial markets 
isocoat provides an immediate platform for growth and further strengthens our presence in latin america 
table of contents initiating restructuring actions in our coatings segment  primarily our wood coatings product line 
these actions reduced our wood coatings production footprint  lowered our overall cost structure and positioned the product line to be profitable in the current economic environment 
progressing with the integration of wattyl an australian paints acquisition completed in september and our plan to bring wattyl s profitability in line with the corporate average 
these actions include facility consolidation in manufacturing and distribution to lower wattyl s supply chain cost structure  closure of underperforming stores and reinvestment in new stores in better locations 
returning cash to shareholders by increasing our annual dividend to per share in fiscal year  our rd consecutive year with a dividend increase  and by repurchasing  shares for  which more than offset the exercise of stock options 
business performance net sales in increased to  from  in  primarily due to acquisitions  pricing  new business predominantly in our coatings segment and favorable foreign currency exchange 
our global presence grew significantly and international sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
we were successful in implementing pricing  improving productivity and gaining new business despite a challenging economic environment and significant raw material cost increases 
gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased due to the lag between higher raw material costs and the impact of our pricing actions 
our ability to return to historical gross margins will depend on the continued implementation of selling price increases 
we continually evaluate our cost structure in the normal course of our business 
during the fiscal year  we initiated restructuring actions in our coatings segment  primarily in our wood product line  which will reduce our manufacturing capacity and overall global headcount 
the end markets served by this product line  which are heavily influenced by the us housing market  have been weak for several years and we do not anticipate any significant changes to these market conditions in the near or medium term 
in addition  we initiated restructuring actions related to improving the profitability of our australian acquisition in the paints segment  wattyl 
specific actions include facility consolidations in manufacturing and distribution  store rationalization and other related costs 
we expect the above restructuring activities to continue through and the total costs to be to per share after tax 
restructuring activities during resulted in pre tax charges of  or per share after tax 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructuring 
during the year  we generated  in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities of  less capital expenditures and dividends  an increase of  from the prior year due to improved operating results 
our total debt of  including notes payable  increased by  due to share repurchases and the acquisition of isocoat see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information  partially offset by operating cash flow and option exercise proceeds 
our liquidity position is strong  with  in cash and cash equivalents and  in unused committed bank credit facilities providing total committed liquidity of  at year end  compared to  at the end of impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of this represents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in our wood coatings reporting unit  part of our coatings segment  and in our gelcoat reporting unit  part of all other 
the impairment charge resulted from changes in the structure of our reporting units used to conduct our impairment testing  as well as changes in our forecasts for the respective reporting units in light of economic conditions prevailing in the markets for these product lines 
in performing the impairment analysis  we reconsidered the appropriate reporting units as a result of i the long term financial outlook determined as part of our strategic planning process which occurs in the fourth quarter  ii the current volatility in the markets in which we compete  and iii a change in our chief operating decision maker codm 
the expected trends for the us housing market are a key input for our internal forecast  which serves as the basis for our strategic plan process 
while in previous years we had expected the us housing market to return to more normal levels during our planning horizon  in fiscal year we concluded that this will not occur 
as a result  the long term financial outlook for the wood and gelcoat product lines diverged from that of our other product lines and no longer met the criteria for aggregation within our historical reporting units 
the resulting impairment charge also reflects our view of anticipated risks based on our expectations of market and general economic conditions 
table of contents as a result of our conclusions  the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of were as follows goodwill intangible assets total wood reporting unit    gelcoat reporting unit    total impairment    wood intangible asset write downs were as follows i technology of  ii customer lists of  and iii trademarks of gelcoat intangible asset write downs were as follows i customer lists of  ii technology of  and iii trademarks of no impairment to the carrying values of the other reporting units was identified 
see note and note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our impairment testing 
earnings per share net income loss per common share diluted was for and for the table below presents adjusted net income per common share diluted  which excludes in the respective periods i the non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets  ii restructuring charges  iii acquisition related charges and iv a net gain on the sale of certain assets included in net income 
net income loss per common share diluted impact of dilutive shares non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets restructuring charges acquisition related charges net gain on sale of certain assets adjusted net income per common share diluted in the non gaap reconciliation of adjusted net income per common share  we used  diluted shares for the period to reflect positive net income on an adjusted basis and the related share dilution 
adjusted net income per common share diluted is a non gaap financial measure 
we disclose this measure because we believe the measure may assist investors in comparing our results of operations in the respective periods without regard to the impact of the non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring charges  acquisition related charges and a net gain on sale of certain assets 
the acquisition related charges are primarily related to the step up of inventory to fair value 
this non gaap measure is provided to enhance investors overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future 
specifically  we believe the non gaap measure provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses  gains and losses on purchases or sales of assets and non cash charges  which may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook 
in addition  because we have historically reported certain non gaap results to investors  we believe the inclusion of this non gaap measure provides consistency in our presentation of financial information

net income change consolidated net income   table of contents financial condition the company s financial condition  cash flow and liquidity remained strong in cash flow from operations was  in  compared to  in and  in the improvement in cash flow in was primarily driven by higher earnings excluding the impact of the non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges along with efficient working capital management 
a key metric we use to measure the effectiveness of our working capital management is working capital as a percentage of annual net sales october  of net sales october  of net sales accounts receivable   inventory   accounts payable   net working capital   our net working capital as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
this improvement was driven by our effective working capital management and a full year of wattyl sales our australian paints acquisition see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
during the period  we used the strong cash flow from operations and  in net proceeds from bank borrowings to fund  in share repurchases   in capital expenditures  and  in acquisitions 
we used cash on hand and  in proceeds from the sale of treasury stock to fund  in dividend payments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our restricted cash primarily associated with cash collateralization of our liability insurance programs 
the ratio of total debt to capital was at october   compared to at october  average debt outstanding during was  at a weighted average interest rate of versus  at last year 
interest expense for was  compared to  in under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under our multi currency credit facilities  senior notes  industrial development bonds  employee benefit plans  non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year  capital expenditures  commodity purchase commitments and telecommunication commitments 
some of our interest charges are variable and are assumed at current rates 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of october  for the fiscal years ending in october and thereafter total notes interest to banks   senior notes interest     industrial development bonds interest  medical retiree serp pension     operating leases      capital expenditures   commodity purchase commitments telecommunication commitments   total contractual cash obligations    we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  gross unrecognized tax benefits of  as of october   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
table of contents we maintain an unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
during the first quarter of  the bank syndicate facility was expanded by  to a total facility size of  and the maturity date was extended from june  to december  as of october  and october   our bank credit facilities consist of the following october  total outstanding facility size december bank syndicate facility   june bilateral facility   september bilateral facility   total unsecured committed revolving credit   uncommitted bank lines of credit   total bank credit facilities   october  total outstanding facility size december bank syndicate facility   june bilateral facility   september bilateral facility   total unsecured committed revolving credit   uncommitted bank lines of credit   total bank credit facilities   our bank syndicate facility includes  and of commercial paper as of october  and october   respectively 
we have a  commercial paper program backstopped by our  credit facility 
our credit facilities have covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of october  our debt covenants do not limit  nor are they reasonably likely to limit  our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
to ensure availability of funds  we maintain uncommitted bank lines of credit sufficient to cover outstanding short term borrowings 
these arrangements are reviewed periodically for renewal and modification 
at october   we had unused lines of committed and uncommitted credit available from banks of  we believe cash flow from operations  existing lines of credit  access to credit facilities and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs 
in the current market conditions  we have demonstrated continued access to capital markets 
we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements 
our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality  short term money market instruments and cash held by our international subsidiaries that are used to fund those subsidiaries day to day operating needs 
those balances have also been used to finance acquisitions 
our investment policy on excess cash is to preserve principal 
we use derivative instruments with a number of counterparties principally to manage well defined interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we evaluate the financial stability of each counterparty and spread the risk among several financial institutions to limit our exposure 
we will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an ongoing basis 
we do not have any credit risk related contingent features in our derivative contracts as of october  we paid common stock dividends of  or per share in  an increase of per share over common stock dividends of  or per share 
we have continuing authorization to purchase shares of our common stock at management s discretion for general corporate purposes 
we repurchased  shares totaling  in compared to  shares totaling  in and  shares totaling  in at october  we had  shares remaining under our current authorization 
table of contents we are involved in various claims relating to environmental and waste disposal matters at a number of current and former plant sites 
we engage or participate in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
we analyze each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution by us relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  we estimate the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 
we accrue appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities  we believe there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where we are one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of our products or waste disposal 
we believe these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which we are engaged 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  we believe there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
we sell extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claim payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
supplier and customer rebates in accordance with underlying agreements  as they are earned  we estimate and record supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on contractual terms of our current purchasing activity 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  we would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss  in the period identified  equal to the difference 
table of contents we review indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing those fair values to the carrying value 
in assessing fair value  we generally utilize a relief from royalty method 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews 
during the goodwill review  the carrying value for the wood and gelcoat reporting units exceeded the fair value  requiring a step valuation using an income approach level measurement in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of this represents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in our wood coatings reporting unit  part of our coatings segment  and in our gelcoat reporting unit  part of all other 
no impairment to the carrying values of the other reporting units was identified 
in performing the impairment analysis  we reconsidered the appropriate reporting units as a result of i the long term financial outlook determined as part of our strategic planning process which occurs in the fourth quarter  ii the current volatility in the markets in which we compete  and iii a change in our chief operating decision maker codm 
the expected trends for the us housing market are a key input for our internal forecast  which serves as the basis for our strategic plan process 
while in previous years we had expected the us housing market to return to more normal levels during our planning horizon  in fiscal year we concluded that this will not occur 
as a result  the long term financial outlook for the wood and gelcoat product lines diverged from that of our other product lines and no longer met the criteria for aggregation within our historical reporting units 
the resulting impairment charge also reflects our view of anticipated risks based on our expectations of market and general economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as long term sales growth rates  forecasted operating margins  market multiples and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
additionally  in assessing goodwill impairment we considered the implied control premium and concluded it was reasonable based on other recent market transactions 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the discount rate  long term growth rate  forecasted operating margins and market multiple assumptions are the four material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows and the business enterprise fair value used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we utilize a cash flow approach level valuation technique in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the income approach  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate  sales growth and forecasted operating margin assumptions used 
for the market approach  average revenue and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization multiples for our peer group are weighted to determine the reporting unit s business enterprise fair value 
the resulting values from the two approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value of the reporting units that will be compared with the reporting units carrying value when assessing impairment in step for reporting units that do not fail step  we perform a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate  long term growth rate and forecasted operating margin assumptions 
the discount rate could increase by more than of the discount rate utilized  the long term growth rate assumption could decline to a zero growth environment  or costs could remain at the current spending level with no cost savings realized in future periods and our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
other than the wood and gelcoat reporting units mentioned above  we have no other reporting units that are at risk of failing step of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
for additional information about goodwill  see note and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
table of contents pension and post retirement medical obligations we sponsor several defined benefit plans for certain hourly and salaried employees 
we sponsor post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans in accordance with gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
the irs has notified us that our fiscal us federal tax return will be audited 
we are currently under audit in several state and foreign jurisdictions 
we also expect various statutes of limitation to expire during the next months 
due to the uncertain response of taxing authorities  a range of outcomes cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
