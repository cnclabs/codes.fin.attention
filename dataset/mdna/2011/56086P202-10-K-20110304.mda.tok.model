item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview makemusic s mission is to develop and market solutions that transform how music is composed  taught  learned and performed 
this is accomplished by providing integrated technology  content and web services to enhance and expand how music is taught  learned and prepared for performance 
providing music education content developers with a technology enriched publishing platform that leverages their copyrighted assets while simultaneously increasing the content and value of the smartmusic library 
offering software solutions for engraving and electronically distributing sheet music 
makemusic develops and markets two product lines  smartmusic learning software for band  jazz ensemble  orchestra and voice and finale music notation software 
we believe these innovative products reinforce each other s features and competitiveness and will allow us to continue to achieve positive operating results 
the well established finale family of music notation software products provides a solid base business that serves a large customer base and generates consistent revenue through sales of new products  annual upgrades and trade up campaigns 
while our existing notation products enjoy leading market positions  in the fourth quarter of  we began the process of evaluating the potential to expand our reach outside of the market we have traditionally served with the assistance of an outside strategic consulting firm 
as a result of this work  we are currently evaluating additional investments for our notation business 
our fiscal year resulted in continued sales growth for makemusic and  overall  a increase over net revenue was achieved 
smartmusic revenue grew due to our year over year subscription growth from  to  and price increases implemented in the third quarter of  from to for teacher subscriptions and from to for student subscriptions 
notation revenue decreased overall  which we attribute primarily to reductions in our sales to distribution partners  offset by stronger direct sales of our finale products and downloads 
gross margin percentages were comparable at in and in operating expenses increased in  due to increased selling and marketing expenses as a result of the planned growth of marketing staff and expansion of our direct sales force 
development expenses also increased primarily due to consulting expenses incurred to support the release of smartmusic and for the review of future notation product direction 
our net income before taxes in was  compared to  in additionally  we reported a significant tax benefit in this tax benefit resulted primarily from reducing our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by  that represented management s estimate of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
during  we have maintained our policy established in the fourth quarter of of recording a deferred tax asset representing tax on three years of forecasted income  there continues to be enough uncertainty around our ability to forecast beyond three years that this policy is prudent 
the primary uncertainties relate to technological changes beyond three years potentially impacting our notation products 
the tax benefit in was  as a result of the factors mentioned  we reported net income of approximately  in compared to net income of  in we believe our greatest growth potential lies with smartmusic  a subscription based product directed toward the very large and constantly renewing market of music students and their teachers 
smartmusic combines a software application  a library of thousands of music titles  skill development exercises and a web service to provide students with a compelling experience and teachers with the realistic means to document the progress of every student 
smartmusic software enhances and transforms the hours spent practicing by putting students inside a professional band or orchestra so that they can hear how the music is supposed to be performed and how their part fits in 
this makes practicing much more engaging  causing students to practice longer and more often 
smartmusic 
table of contents provides access to an ever increasing library of band  jazz ensemble and orchestra literature 
each title includes individual part assignments authored by respected educators  thereby providing music teachers with a time saving solution for preparing selections for their next performance 
smartmusic also offers a rich variety of effective practice tools that make practice time more efficient and productive 
the combination of making practice time more engaging and productive leads to rapid student skill development  increased student confidence  higher student retention  and stronger music programs 
smartmusic gradebook is a web based grade book that is included with each teacher subscription designed to manage student assignments  grades  and recordings while documenting the progress of each student and assessing student achievement 
this provides music educators and students with exciting new possibilities to assist in developing strong music programs and complying with accountability requirements 
smartmusic gradebook enables teachers to easily send assignments to each of their students 
students complete the assignment on their home computer  provided that they have a smartmusic subscription  or on a school computer equipped with smartmusic 
submitted assignments are automatically graded and posted in the teacher s smartmusic gradebook thereby providing teachers with the visible means for measuring student achievement 
our educational sales organization focuses on direct school district sales aimed at the  schools who match our ideal demographic profile 
we sell site agreements that provide discounts for volume purchases 
the smartmusic quarterly site agreement totals are shown in the smartmusic metrics table below 
in addition to tracking the total number of subscriptions  we track the number of teachers who use smartmusic gradebook and the number of those teachers who are using smartmusic gradebook to deliver and manage student assignments to fifty students or more 
as of december   we reported  gradebook teachers compared to gradebook teachers as of december  the following table illustrates our quarterly smartmusic metrics dec mar jun sep dec total subscriptions educator accounts educators who have issued assignments gradebook teachers site agreements site agreement educator subscriptions annual statistics that restart on july of each year reflecting the start of the school year cycle the smartmusic target business model is to have music educators increase their use of smartmusic gradebook to set up their classes  enroll students and issue assignments  which we believe would result in an increase in student subscriptions 
as stated above   or  of the teachers who have purchased smartmusic have utilized smartmusic gradebook  and those teachers have  students receiving smartmusic assignments 
we increased the size of our educational sales force from to and our marketing staff from to in to strengthen our strategic sales and marketing initiatives 
we expect to continue to aggressively invest in expanding our sales force to increase the penetration level of our target market 
in addition  our development efforts have focused on improving and simplifying the smartmusic purchase process  gradebook class set up  student enrollment and smartmusic assignments 
the overall objective is to make these processes easy and intuitive for both teachers and students 
as a result of the increased focus of our direct sales force and product enhancements  site agreement educator subscriptions increased  from  at december   to  at december  we believe that our technological investments in smartmusic have created a digital pipeline between our growing subscriber base of more than  and the music publishers who provide smartmusic content 
this growing platform is a strategic asset for makemusic and we are focusing on finding additional ways to monetize it 
as a result  we expect to make additional investments in development to leverage the smartmusic platform and to increase our business model flexibility 

table of contents the following table illustrates the net new smartmusic subscriptions for each quarter for the years ended december  and quarterly quarter end beginning new renewed renewal subscriptions quarter end net new date subscriptions subscriptions subscriptions rate ended subscriptions subscriptions we define renewed subscriptions as those subscriptions that customers purchase within the two month period after their prior subscription ended 
because of changes to the start of school from year to year as well as fluctuations in the date that music teachers implement their curriculum  we commonly see subscribers that have a delay of up to two months in renewing their subscription 
as a result  we believe that using the above definition of a renewal more accurately reflects the renewal rate for smartmusic subscriptions 
in the fourth quarter of  the smartmusic renewal rate declined from prior quarters 
we believe this can be attributed to the price increase that was implemented during the third quarter that resulted in early renewals and purchases prior to the increase 
the renewal rate during the last six months of was compared to during the last six months of additionally  there were some educators who delayed adoption of smartmusic due to the late release and product functionality delays in smartmusic gradebook 
we have achieved positive cash flow from operations for the last six years  including the most recent year ended december  our quarterly results will fluctuate as a result of the seasonality of the education market 
due to current economic conditions and concerns over school budgets  we remain cautious regarding our future financial projections 
however  with increased revenues and  in particular  the growth in smartmusic subscriptions  plus improvements in operational efficiency over the last few years and the establishment of contingency plans to be implemented if our revenue and cash flow objectives are not met  we feel that we can continue to achieve positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our distribution of notation products in domestic and international markets through independent dealers and distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts  however  none are greater than of the total revenue 
some international customers pay for the product prior to shipment  domestic dealers and distributors who do not prepay are granted payment terms and credit limits based on credit checks and account history 
we have successfully done business with most of our dealers and distributors for many years 
there were no significant uncollectible accounts in or any sales directly to home users are prepaid and schools submit purchase orders for purchases 
makemusic records an accrual for potential non payments  which has historically been sufficient to cover uncollected accounts 
financial conditions in international markets and economic conditions can change quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 

table of contents sales returns and allowance reserves 
smartmusic teacher subscriptions automatically renew at the end of their subscription period 
notices of renewal are sent to the teacher in advance and an invoice is sent upon the renewal date 
a reserve is booked for those subscriptions that automatically renew and are subsequently cancelled due to teacher relocation  teacher cancellation  or non payment of accounts 
the reserve is then evaluated quarterly to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
when a new version of finale is released  dealers and distributors retain the right to return any unsold versions of the prior release normally of total prior year sales in exchange for an equal number of units of the updated version of the product that is returned 
the history of these returns is tracked and revenue is deferred based on the expected return rate until the new product is released  at which time the product may be returned for credit provided the customer places an equivalent number of units order for the new version 
inventory valuation 
inventories consisting of packaged product  materials and accessories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost method 
we record a provision to adjust slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market based on historical experience and current product demand 
the carrying value of inventory is evaluated at least quarterly and adjusted as needed 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence when the inventory is no longer used in products in their most current released version 
stock based compensation 
accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  formerly known as sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense we recognize for each option award 
there are several assumptions that we must make when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends payable  and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the options and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
capitalized software costs 
costs incurred in the development of software products are capitalized in accordance with asc  software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  formerly known as fas which requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when the detailed program design and all planning and testing activities are completed 
capitalization of computer software costs shall cease when a product is available for general release to customers 
we capitalize the costs of producing any new software product  which includes individual song titles to be included as repertoire with the smartmusic product 
the estimated economic life of smartmusic gradebook  whose capitalization and market introduction was completed in  has been established as five years 
this five year amortization period is consistent with the initial licensing term for the large ensemble titles available in smartmusic that have pre authored assignments for use by teachers within smartmusic gradebook 
similarly  upon release of a large ensemble song title into smartmusic  we amortize the related capitalized software costs over the estimated life of the song  not to exceed the five year licensing period 
a reserve is recorded for an estimate of song titles that will not be released 
annual development of notation products consists of maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to review our amortization period for capitalized software costs as considered necessary based upon any new information and information gained in our review of the net realizable value of unamortized costs 
post contract support 
we account for software maintenance offered on our notation products in accordance with asc  software software revenue recognition  formerly aicpa sop which states that revenue for post contract support pcs may be recognized upon the initial sale when pcs is included with the initial license  the cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant  there are no unspecified upgrades  and only minor bug fixes are offered to licensed users 
however  the estimated related costs are accrued in the same period that the sales price is recognized 
we provide unlimited  free telephone  e mail  and on line technical support to our customers and  therefore  accrue an estimated cost of future support for our notation products in the period of sale 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
we review goodwill for potential impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we have assigned all of our goodwill to the notation reporting unit and compare the fair value of this reporting unit effective january  as computed primarily by applying a combination of income and market valuation approaches  to its book carrying value  including goodwill step 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step to arrive at an implied fair value of the goodwill  by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the reported value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates by us  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by reporting units  the risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method provided by asc  income taxes formerly fas 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we assess the likelihood that  and the extent to which  our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
if we increase or decrease a valuation allowance in a given period  then we must increase or decrease the tax provision in our statements of income 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  minnesota net operating loss carry forwards of  and research and development tax credits of  and minnesota research and development tax credits of  the losses and tax credits are carried forward for federal and state corporate income taxes and may be used to reduce future taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we remained uncertain on how economic conditions would impact our back to school selling cycle and annual financial results 
based upon our strong performance in the fourth quarter of  our operating results in recent years and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined in that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our valuation allowance by  representing the approximate estimated tax on three years of forecasted net income 
during  we have maintained our policy established in the fourth quarter of of recording a deferred tax asset representing tax on three years of forecasted income 
there continues to be enough uncertainty around our ability to forecast beyond three years that this policy is prudent 
the primary uncertainties relate to technological changes beyond three years potentially impacting our notation products 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the balance of our deferred tax assets  as of december  we have maintained a valuation allowance of  should the remaining  valuation allowance be reversed in the future  a liability of  would have to be established for uncertain tax positions 
as required by asc  income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
in addition  future utilization of nol carry forwards is subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
the acquisition of additional shares by a greater than shareholder in january resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol s in the future will be limited

these quarterly fluctuations are created by the notation product release cycle and the seasonality impact of sales to schools related to the school year fiscal calendar 
management expects to continue to achieve positive annual cash flow in the foreseeable future but not necessarily in each quarter 
if we do not meet our anticipated revenue levels due to economic conditions  a significantly later than anticipated product release  or a decrease in demand for our products  management is committed to expense reductions as necessary to ensure adequate cash levels 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for investment in product development primarily relating to the additional titles and method books being added into smartmusic 
cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  this  reduction was due to our decrease in property and equipment purchases and repertoire development spending 
current year expenditures were  for purchases of property and equipment and  for capitalization of repertoire development 
we expect to incur higher levels of development spending in the future as our growth initiatives in both the notation and smartmusic segments 
cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to cash used of  in the year ended december  this change is primarily due to stock option exercise activity
