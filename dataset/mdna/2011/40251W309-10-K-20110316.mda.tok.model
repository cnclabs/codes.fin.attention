item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a holding company which conducts operations through our wholly owned china subsidiaries 
our business is conducted and reported in three segments 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  schc  we produce and trade bromine and crude salt 
we are one of the largest producers of bromine in china  as measured by production output 
elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture 
bromine also is used to form intermediary chemical compounds such as tmb bromine is commonly used in brominated flame retardants  fumigants  water purification compounds  dyes  medicines  disinfectants 
crude salt is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical  food beverage  and other industries 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  syci  we manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration  oil and gas distribution  oil field drilling  wastewater processing  papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals 
on december   we acquired  through a share exchange  upper class group limited  a british virgin islands holding corporation which then owned all of the outstanding shares of schc 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the share exchange is considered to be a capital transaction in substance  rather than a business combination 
that is  the share exchange is equivalent to the issuance of stock by upper class for the net assets of our company  accompanied by a recapitalization  and is accounted for as a change in capital structure 
accordingly  the accounting for the share exchange was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition  except no goodwill was recorded 
under reverse takeover accounting  the post reverse acquisition comparative historical financial statements of the legal acquirer  our company  are those of the legal acquiree  upper class group limited  which is considered to be the accounting acquirer 
share and per share amounts reflected in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on february   we  acting through schc  acquired syci 
since the ownership of gulf resources  inc and syci was then substantially the same  the transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  whereby we recognized the assets and liabilities of syci at their carrying amounts 
share and per share amounts stated in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on august   syci completed the construction of a new chemical production line 
it passed the examination by shouguang city administration of work safety and local fire department 
this new production line focuses on producing environmental friendly additive products  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration 
the line has an annual production capacity of  tons 
formal production of this chemical production line started on september  on october  we completed a for reverse stock split of our common stock  such that for each four shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split 
all shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split figures 
on october  our shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol gfre 
as a result of our acquisitions of schc and syci  our historical financial statements and the information presented below reflects the accounts of schc and syci 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  years ended december  december  change net revenue cost of net revenue gross profit sales  marketing and other operating expense research and development costs general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expenses  net income before taxes income taxes net income basic and diluted earnings per share net revenue net revenue was  in fiscal year  an increase of approximately million or as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to i the strong growth in our bromine segment  in which revenue increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately  ii the strong growth in our crude salt segment  in which revenue increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately  and iii strong demand in our chemical products segment  in which revenue increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately the increase in net revenue from our bromine segment was mainly due to the increase in the average selling price of bromine 
the average selling price of bromine increased from  per tonne for the fiscal year to  per tonne for fiscal year  an increase of 
the sales volume of bromine slightly decreased by  from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year the increase in average selling price was a result of i strong demand for brominated flame retardants  fumigants  water purification compounds  dyes  medicines  and disinfectants in the china market following the recovery of business and economic conditions and reforms in the medical industry in china  and ii expansion of bromine applications in a variety of industries 
the sales volume of crude salt slightly increased by  from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year  and the average selling price of crude salt increased from approximately per tonne to above per tonne  an increase of approximately 
the increase in net revenue from our chemical segment was mainly due to the strong demand for environmentally friendly oil and gas exploration chemicals and agricultural intermediaries 

table of contents net revenue by segment vs 
year ended year ended percent increase december  december  of net revenue segment percent of total percent of total bromine crude salt chemical products total sales years ended december percentage change bromine and crude salt segments product sold in tonnes increase decrease bromine crude salt although net revenue in all segments grew  the growth of sales of bromine and crude salt was much higher than that of our chemical products operations mainly due to the outweighed increase in average selling price of bromine and crude salt 
due to the diverse product mix and varying values  management does not believe that the tonne sold by the chemical product division is a meaningful metric 
cost of net revenue cost of net revenue reflects mainly the raw materials consumed and the direct salaries and benefits of staff engaged in the production process  electricity  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and other manufacturing costs 
our cost of net revenue was  in fiscal year  an increase of approximately million or approximately from the cost of net revenue in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the increase in purchase price in raw materials and mineral resources compensation fees paid in the bromine and chemical products segments 
the rate of increase for cost of net revenue was lower than that of net revenue because the rate of inflation relating to cost of net revenue was lower than the percentage increase in selling price of our products  as well as leverage due to the economies of scale 
gross profit years ended december of net revenue of net revenue cost of net revenue gross profit our gross profit was  or of net revenue  for fiscal year compared to  or of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a rise of margin percentage in our bromine and crude salt segments 
for the fiscal year as compared to  the average selling price of bromine increased from  per tonne to  per tonne with an increase of and the average selling price of crude salt increased from approximately per tonne to over per tonne with an increase of approximately  while the inflation rate for cost of net revenue in our bromine and crude salt segments were much lower than the increase rate of selling price because the demand exceeded the supply of bromine in the china domestic market 
we expect the trend will continue in the year of research and development costs research and development costs result from the agreement that syci and east china university of science and technology entered in june to establish a co op research and development center to develop new bromine based chemical compounds and products to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry 
all research findings and patents developed by this center will belong to gulf resources 
since the second quarter of  syci conducted research for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives  the purpose of which is for the testing the manufacturing routine and samples 
the research and development expense incurred for the aforesaid new production line from outside parties and the use of schc s products during the fiscal year were  and  respectively 
the total research and development costs incurred for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately  from the general and administrative expenses of  during fiscal year this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to i the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of approximately million for the fiscal year  which were previously treated as other income approximately million for fiscal year  and ii the increase in salary and welfare payments  depreciation  and land duty and franchise tax by approximately million 
during the year ended december   the company incurred a loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of approximately million as the equipment being disposed of was specialized equipment used in the bromine and chemical production industry which has few suppliers and an inactive second hand market  which resulted in low second hand price 
in order to take advantage of the increasing demand for environmentally friendly chemical products produced from bromine  we intend to focus our future chemical production on environmentally friendly products  and therefore  have disposed of certain machinery and equipment that has been used for other products 
also  in order to enhance our bromine production process  we disposed of certain outdated auxiliary machinery 
such increment was partly offset by i the decrease in non cash expenses related to stock options granted to our employees and a warrant granted to our investor relations firm by approximately  and ii the reclassification of prc mineral resources compensation fees of approximately million for fiscal year  which were previously treated as general and administrative expenses  but were reclassified as cost of net revenue approximately million for the fiscal year income from operations income from operations by segment year ended december  year ended december  percent of total percent of total segment bromine and crude salt for crude salt chemical products income from operations before corporate costs corporate costs income from operations separate segment information not available income from operations was  in fiscal year or of net revenue  an increase of  or approximately over income from operations in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue and relatively lower increase in cost of net revenue as explained hereinbefore 
in fiscal year  aggregate income from operations in the bromine and crude salt segments was  an increase of from  in fiscal year in fiscal year  income from operations in the chemical products segment was  a slight decrease of from  in fiscal year the increase in the income from operations of bromine and crude salt was mainly due to the increase in the selling price of bromine 
the decrease in income from operations of our chemical products was due to the extensive research and development costs incurred for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives for fiscal year which offset increases in revenue from our environmentally friendly oil and gas exploration chemicals and agricultural intermediaries 
other income expense other income was  for fiscal year  an increase of  from an expense of  for fiscal year such increase in other income was primarily due to the increase in interest income of approximately  and the sale of wastewater to some of our customers in the amount of approximately million since march wastewater is generated from the production of bromine which eventually becomes crude salt when it evaporates 
not all of our bromine production plants have sufficient area on the property to allow for evaporation of wastewater to produce crude salt 
certain of our customers who have facilities located adjacent to our bromine production plants have agreed to channel our wastewater into brine pans on their properties for evaporation 
these customers then are able to sell the resulting crude salt themselves 
we have signed agreements with three of our customers to sell them our wastewater at market prices 
for fiscal year  the major component of the other expense was the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of approximately million 
net income net income was  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in selling price of bromine and crude salt 

table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  years ended december  december  change net revenue cost of net revenue gross profit sales  marketing and other operating expense n a research and development costs general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expenses  net income before taxes income taxes net income basic and diluted earnings per share net revenue net revenue was  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the growth i in our bromine and crude salt segment with revenue increasing from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately  and ii in our sales of chemical products  which increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately 
the increase in the net revenue of bromine and crude salt was primarily due to the net effect of i the increase in sales volume arising from the increase in production capacity after the asset acquisitions made in january of and in september of  which are now in full operation  and ii the decrease in average selling price of both bromine and crude salt 
as the demand for bromine always exceeded the supply available  the increase in production of the company contributed to the increase in sales in the current year 
among the total increase of net revenue   was due to the asset acquisitions 
the increase in the net revenue of our chemical products was due to the introduction of new environmental friendly additive products which was in operation since september  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration in fourth quarter of  and improvement of our pesticide intermediate products 
net revenue by segment vs 
year ended year ended percent increase december  december  of net revenue segment percent of total percent of total bromine and crude salt chemical products total sales 
table of contents years ended december percentage change bromine and crude salt segment product sold in tonnes increase decrease bromine crude salt the proportion of our total net revenue represented by bromine and crude salt in fiscal year decreased as compared to the same period in as a result of fast growth in chemical production segment 
although net revenue in both segments grew  the growth of sales of bromine and crude salt was lower than that of our chemical products operations mainly due to the introduction of new environmental friendly additive products  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration in fourth quarter of  and improvement of our pesticide intermediate 
cost of net revenue cost of net revenue reflects the raw materials consumed  direct salaries and benefits  electricity and other manufacturing costs 
our cost of net revenue was  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately from the cost of net revenue in fiscal year the rate of increase for cost of net revenue was lower than the increase rate of sales due to the cost inflation rate was lower than the increase rate of selling price 
gross profit years ended december of net revenue of net revenue cost of net revenue gross profit our gross profit rate increased from in to in due to an increase in our net revenue by in compared to  which enabled us to leverage our fixed costs 
the increase was also due to the fact that increases in our selling prices were higher than increases in the rate of inflation in the prc in  because the demand exceeded the supply of bromine in the china domestic market 
research and development costs research and development costs result from a five year agreement entered into by syci and east china university of science and technology in june to establish a co op research and development center to develop new bromine based chemical compounds and products to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry 
all research findings and patents developed by this center will belong to gulf resources 
the research and development costs incurred for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately from the general and administrative expenses of  during fiscal year this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an expense in the amount of  related to a warrant issued to the placement agent in our december private placement and expenses in the amount of  relating to our listing on nasdaq in october income from operations income from operations by segment year ended december  year ended december  percent of total percent of total segments bromine and crude salt chemical products income from operations before corporate costs corporate costs income from operations 
table of contents income from operations was  in fiscal year or of net revenue  an increase of  or approximately over income from operations in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the increase in revenues and relatively lower increase in cost of net revenue as shown above 
this increase resulted from increases in income from operations in both the bromine and crude salt  and the chemical products segments of the company 
in fiscal year  income from operations in the bromine and crude salt segment was  an increase of from  in fiscal year in fiscal year  income from operations in the chemical products division was  an increase of from income from operations in this division of  in fiscal year the increase in the income from operations of bromine and crude salt was primarily as a result of the assets acquisitions as well production capacity expansion 
the increase in the income from operations of our chemical products was due to the new product of friendly additive products  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration in fourth quarter of  and improvement of our pesticide intermediate 
other income expense other expense was  for fiscal year  an increase of  from the other income of  for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the loss from disposal of property  plant and equipment 
during the year ended december   a loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of  was resulted because the property  plant and equipment being disposed of were specialized equipment used in the bromine producing industry in which there are a few suppliers and second hand market is not active  resulting in low second hand price 
net income net income was  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the  net revenue increase from bromine and crude salt segment and the  net revenue increase from chemical products segment 
another reason for this result was the leverage of fixed cost due to expansion of sales 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  as of december  the components of this increase of  are reflected below 
statement of cash flows years ended december net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net cash inflow for the fiscal year and  the company met its working capital and capital investment requirements mainly by using cash flows from operations 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities relating to bromine asset purchases 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operating activities of  primarily attributable to net income of  net cash provided by operating activities in increased by  from that of the primary source of this increment was due to the increase in net income 
as a result of increasing demand for bromine and crude salt in the china market  the selling price per tonne of bromine and crude salt for fiscal year increased by approximately and respectively  over fiscal year net cash used in investing activities and provided by financing activities we used approximately million cash for the construction of waste water chemical additives line during fiscal year we used another approximately million cash for the acquisition of bromine assets in june of we also used approximately million to build new channels and wells for bromine facilities during the fiscal year in late december  we used approximately million cash to acquire a crude salt field 
these projects were financed by opening cash balances as of january   proceeds from one of the placees of approximately million from a private placement and cash generated from operations during fiscal year 
table of contents we believe that our available funds and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs for the next twelve months 
however we will likely need to raise additional capital in order to fund the ongoing program of acquiring unlicensed bromine properties  increasing our chemical production capacity and developing new production line of wastewater treatment additives 
we expect to raise those funds through the issuance of additional shares of our equity securities in one or more public or private offerings  or through credit facilities obtained with lending institutions or a combination of both 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such funding  whether through the issuance of debt or equity  on terms satisfactory to management and our board of directors 
working capital at december  was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was mainly attributable to the cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year we had available cash of approximately million at december   most of which are in highly liquid current deposits with no or little interest rate 
we intend to retain the cash for future expansion of our bromine and crude salt businesses through acquisition  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
for the immediate future we intend to focus our efforts on the activities of schc and syci as these segments continue to expand within the chinese market 
our long term strategic goal is to extend our market to overseas countries 
as a result  we may issue additional shares of our capital stock and incur new debt in order to raise cash for acquisitions and other capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
as of december   we have committed approximately  for a year capital lease of a real property adjacent to factory no 
 with the related production facility  the land and pipelines  other production equipment and the buildings located on the property  with an annual payment of approximately  up to december   aggregating  and an extension construction of buildings and plant and machinery in factory no 
 of approximately  this capital lease commitment of  is included in the table shown below 
we may not be able to identify  successfully integrate or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire  or any expansion of our business 
an expansion may involve a number of risks  including possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management attention  inability to retain key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated events and the financial statement effect of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of operations 
in addition  if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase  the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially 
we may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable  under managed  or in its early stages of development or growth 
in addition  if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase  the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially 
our inability to implement and manage our expansion strategy successfully may have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
contractual commitments the following table sets forth payments due by period for fixed contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations contract for r d expenses   total critical accounting policies and estimates a use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
b accounts receivable and allowance of doubtful accounts accounts receivable is stated at cost  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of the collectability of trade and other receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the amount of allowance and we consider the historical level of credit losses and apply certain percentage to accounts receivable balance 
we make judgments about the credit worthiness of each customer based on ongoing credit evaluations  and monitors current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
if the financial condition of the customer begins to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 

table of contents as of december  and  allowance for doubtful accounts were nil 
no allowances for doubtful accounts were charged to the income statement for the years ended december   and c property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses 
expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives 
mineral rights are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses 
mineral rights are amortized ratably over the term of the lease  or the equivalent term under the units of production method  whichever is shorter 
construction in progress primarily represents the renovation costs of plant  machinery and equipment 
costs incurred are capitalized and transferred to property and equipment upon completion  at which time depreciation commences 
cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred 
our depreciation and amortization policies on property  plant and equipment other than mineral rights and construction in progress are as follows useful life in years buildings machinery motor vehicles equipment d asset retirement obligation we follow fasb asc  which established a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs 
fasb asc requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which the legal obligation associated with the retirement of the long lived asset is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation is paid  and to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid  a gain or loss upon settlement is recorded 
currently  there are no reclamation or abandonment obligations associated with the land being utilized for exploitation 
e recoverability of long lived assets long lived and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we are not aware of any events or circumstances which indicate the existence of an impairment which would be material 
f mineral rights we follow fasb asc that certain mineral rights are considered tangible assets and that mineral rights should be accounted for based on their substance 
mineral rights are included in property  plant and equipment 
g revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of value added tax  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the goods has occurred  customer acceptance has been obtained  which means the significant risks and ownership have been transferred to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
h income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

table of contents i stock based compensation common stock  stock options and stock warrants issued to employees or directors are recorded at their fair values estimated at grant date using the black scholes model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
common stock  stock options and stock warrants issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value using the black scholes model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the valuation date  which for options and warrants related to contracts that have substantial disincentives to non performance is the date of the contract  and for all other contracts the measurement date is the date that the service is complete 
expense related to the options and warrants is recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period 
where expense must be recognized prior to a valuation date  the expense is computed under the black scholes model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock at the end of the period  and any subsequent changes in the market price of the underlying common stock up through the valuation date is reflected in the expense recorded in the subsequent period in which that change occurs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk from its cash at bank and fixed deposits and accounts receivable 
the credit risk on cash at bank and fixed deposits is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial institutions 
accounts receivable are subjected to credit evaluations 
an allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts which have been determined by reference to past default experience and the current economic environment 
foreign exchange risk the value of the renminbi rmb against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the rmb has no longer been pegged to the us dollar at a constant exchange rate 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate within a flexible peg range against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in rmb  but our reporting currency is the us dollar  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in us dollars 
in addition  appreciation or depreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue in the future that will be exchanged into us dollars and earnings from  and the value of  any us dollar denominated investments we make in the future 
very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited  and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currencies 
most of the transactions of the company are settled in rmb and us dollars 
in the opinion of the directors  the company is not exposed to significant foreign currency risk 

table of contents inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs  could impair our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
company s operations are substantially in foreign countries substantially all of our operations are conducted in china and are subject to various political  economic  and other risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting business in china 
among other risks  the company and its subsidiaries operations are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds  export duties  quotas  and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  and political conditions and governmental regulations 
additional information regarding such risks can be found under the heading risk factors in this form k
