the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this form k contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by this forward looking information due to the factors discussed under risk factors  cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
as of january   we distributed approximately  products from over suppliers to service more than  customers nationwide  including dealers  industrial manufacturers  manufactured housing producers and home improvement retailers 
we operate our distribution business from sales centers in atlanta and denver  and our network of approximately distribution centers 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding  
table of contents outdoor living and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
industry conditions a number of factors cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of these factors are seasonal or cyclical in nature 
conditions in the united states housing market are at historically low levels 
our operating results are closely tied to united states housing starts  and therefore have declined during the past several years 
additionally  the mortgage markets have experienced substantial disruption due to a rising number of defaults and historically high levels of foreclosures 
this disruption and the related defaults have increased the inventory of homes for sale and also have caused lenders to tighten mortgage qualification criteria which further reduces demand for new homes 
we expect the downturn in new housing activity will continue to negatively impact our operating results for the foreseeable future 
we continue to prudently manage our inventories  receivables and spending in this environment 
along with many forecasters  however  we believe united states housing demand will improve in the long term based on population demographics and a variety of other factors 
tender offer on july   our board of directors our board received notice from our largest stockholder  cerberus abp investor llc cai that it intended to make a tender offer for the shares of our stock it does not own for in cash per share 
our board formed a special committee the special committee consisting of our three independent directors  to evaluate the tender offer 
the special committee was granted full power and authority to evaluate the proposal to determine our recommendation to our stockholders with respect to any tender offer commenced by cai and to take any other action it determined to be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders 
completion of the tender offer was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions  including that as result of the tender offer  cai would own of our issued and outstanding shares  which we refer to as the condition 
on september   cai and cerberus increased the purchase price to be paid in their cash tender offer to per share for all our outstanding publicly held shares not owned by cai or its affiliates 
on september   the special committee unanimously determined  by all members participating in the deliberations  that the tender offer was fair  from a financial point of view  to our stockholders other than cai and cerberus capital 
additionally  the special committee recommended  on behalf of us and the board  that our stockholders accept the tender offer and tender their shares 
on october   cai announced that the condition had not been satisfied and  as a result  the tender offer expired without cai purchasing any shares 
during fiscal  we incurred charges relating to stock valuation and legal fees of million as a result of the tender offer 
these charges were included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
supply agreement with g p on april   we entered into a modification agreement related to our supply agreement with g p 
the modification agreement effectively terminated the existing supply agreement with respect to our distribution of g p plywood  osb and lumber 
as a result of terminating this agreement  we are no longer contractually obligated to make minimum purchases of products from g p 
we continue to distribute a variety of g p building products  including engineered lumber  which is covered under a three year purchase agreement dated february  g p agreed to pay us million in exchange for our agreement to terminate the supply agreement one year earlier than the may  termination date previously agreed upon 
under the terms of the modification agreement  we received four quarterly cash payments of million  which began on may  and ended on february  as a result of the termination  we recognized a net gain of million 
table of contents in  as a reduction to operating expense 
the gain was net of a million write off of an intangible asset associated with the supply agreement 
we believe the early termination of the supply agreement contributed to the decline in our structural panel sales volume during fiscal and however  because the majority of these sales are through the direct sales channel  the lower structural panel sales volume had an insignificant impact on our gross profit during these periods 
to the extent we are unable to replace these volumes with structural product from g p or other suppliers  the early termination of the supply agreement may continue to negatively impact our sales of structural products which could impact our net sales and our costs  which in turn could impact our gross profit  net income  and cash flows 
the three year purchase agreement for engineered lumber contains a mechanism for establishing pricing for the products we purchase under the purchase agreement from g p 
if bluelinx and g p are unable to agree on product pricing in accordance with this mechanism  we could experience a product shortage unless and until we obtain a replacement supplier or suppliers 
we may not be able to obtain replacement products on favorable economic terms  or may not be able to obtain comparable alternative products 
an inability to replace products on favorable economic terms or with comparable products could adversely impact our net sales and our costs  which in turn could impact our gross profit  net income and cash flows 
osb litigation settlement until the third quarter of fiscal  we were a claimant in a class action lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that the following manufacturers of oriented strand board osb conspired in violation of federal antitrust law to restrict the supply of osb structural panel products and raise prices louisiana pacific corporation  weyerhaeuser company  georgia pacific llc f k a georgia pacific corporation  ainsworth lumber co 
ltd  potlatch corporation  norbord industries inc  tolko industries ltd  grant forest products inc 
and grant forest products sales inc  and jm huber corporation or huber engineered woods llc collectively  the defendants 
on september   we received a cash settlement in the amount of million in satisfaction of our claims under the class action lawsuit 
this million was recognized as a gain in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our statements of operations for fiscal year selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction 
we believe a substantial percentage of our sales are directly related to new home construction 
our operating results also are impacted by changes in product prices 
structural products prices can vary significantly based on short term and long term changes in supply and demand 
the prices of specialty products also can vary from time to time  although they generally are significantly less variable than structural products

seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital and accounts receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we have approximately million of excess availability under our amended revolving credit facility as of january  under our amended revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain our excess availability above the greater of million or the amount 
table of contents equal to of the lesser of the borrowing base  as defined therein  or million subject to increase to million if we exercise the uncommitted accordion provision in the amended revolving credit facility in full 
if we fail to maintain this minimum excess availability  the amended revolving credit facility requires us to i maintain certain financial ratios  which we would not meet with current operating results  and ii limit our capital expenditures  which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
for additional information regarding our financial covenants under our revolving credit facility  see the risk factors the instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business set forth under item a risk factors 
excess liquidity likely will continue to decrease while our industry and our company begins its recovery from this historic housing market downturn  however we believe that the amounts available from our revolving credit facility and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the next months 
if economic conditions  especially those related to the housing market  do not improve  we will need to seek additional sources of capital to support our operations 
the credit markets have experienced adverse conditions for the past few years  which may adversely affect our lenders ability to fulfill their commitment under our revolving credit facility 
based on information available to us as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have no indications that the financial institutions included in our revolving credit facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments 
we may elect to selectively pursue acquisitions 
accordingly  depending on the nature of the acquisition  we may use cash or stock  or a combination of both  as acquisition currency 
our cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing acquisitions in the future 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors

the decrease in other current assets is due to the receipt of our million federal tax refund in fiscal the decrease in cash is due to the movement discussed within coupled with our operating loss adjusted for non cash items 
this reduction is offset by an increase in inventory of million  due to the addition of a new outdoor living product line and the related build in inventory  a decrease in accounts payable and bank overdrafts of million 
the decrease in  accounts payable and overdrafts is due to the timing of payments 
the remaining decrease is related to various insignificant changes in other working capital components

the primary driver of cash flow used in operations was a net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to a reduction in purchase volume associated with decreased demand resulting from market conditions 
these cash outflows were offset by a decrease in inventories of million to meet existing demand and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to an overall decline in the housing market related to sales volume 
during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flow from operations was a decrease in inventories of million to meet existing demand and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to an overall decline in the housing market related to sales volume

investing activities during fiscal  cash flows used by investing activities totaled million  compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of million in during fiscal and fiscal  our expenditures for property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were used primarily to computer equipment  leasehold improvements  and certain machinery and equipment 
we estimate that capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million  which includes approximately million to purchase the replacement property for nashville  tn 
our capital expenditures are anticipated to be paid with borrowings from our amended revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of our nashville  tn property 
proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment were million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively

we classify the lowest projected balance of the credit facility over the next twelve months of million as long term debt 
as of january  and january   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling and million  respectively  for the purposes of securing collateral requirements under our interest rate swap  insurance programs and for guaranteeing payment of international purchases based on the fulfillment of certain conditions on july   we reached an agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  successor by merger to wachovia bank  national association  and the other signatories to our existing revolving credit facility  dated august   as amended  to amend the terms thereof 
this amendment extends the date of final maturity of the facility to january  and decreases the maximum availability under the agreement from million to million 
this decrease does not impact our current available borrowing capacity under the amended revolving credit facility since the borrowing base  which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  currently permits less than million in revolving credit facility borrowings 
this amendment also includes an additional million uncommitted accordion credit facility  which will permit us to increase the maximum borrowing capacity up to million 
as a result of reducing our maximum borrowing capacity from million to million  we recorded expense of million for the write off of the existing debt issuance costs associated with the reduction in borrowing capacity 
we incurred million in new debt issuance costs  which we capitalized and will amortize over the extended debt term to interest expense 
under the amended agreement  our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants and restrictions for asset based loans 
our most significant covenant is a requirement that we maintain a fixed charge ratio of to in the event our excess availability falls below the greater of million or the amount equal to of the lesser of the borrowing base or million subject to increase to million if we exercise the uncommitted accordion credit facility in full the excess availability threshold 
the fixed charge ratio is calculated as ebitda over the sum of cash payments for income taxes  interest expense  cash dividends  principal payments on debt  and capital expenditures 
ebitda is defined as bluelinx corporation s net income before interest and tax expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and other non cash charges 
the fixed charge ratio requirement only applies to us when excess availability under our revolving credit facility is less than the excess availability threshold for three consecutive business days 
as of january  and through the time of the filing this annual report on form k  we were in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facility 
we had million and million of availability as of january  and january   respectively 
our lowest level of availability in the last three years was million as of january  we currently do not anticipate our excess availability in fiscal will drop below the excess availability threshold 
should our excess availability fall below the excess availability threshold for more than three consecutive business days  however  we would not meet the required fixed charge ratio with our current operating results 
in addition  we must maintain a springing lock box arrangement where customer remittances go directly to a lock box maintained by our lenders and then are forwarded to our general bank accounts 
our outstanding borrowings are not reduced by these payments unless our excess availability is less than the excess availability threshold  excluding unrestricted cash  for three consecutive business days or in the event of default 
our amended revolving credit facility does not contain a subjective acceleration clause which would allow our lenders to accelerate the scheduled maturities of our debt or to cancel our agreement 
during fiscal  we elected to permanently reduce our revolving loan threshold limit from million to million 
as a result of these actions  we recorded expense of million for the write off of deferred financing costs 

table of contents on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge 
through january   the hedge was highly effective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows 
fluctuations in the fair value of the ineffective portion  if any  of the cash flow hedge were reflected in earnings 
during fiscal  we reduced our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by million  which reduced outstanding debt below the interest rate swap s notional amount of million  at which point the hedge became ineffective in offsetting future changes in expected cash flows during the remaining term of the interest rate swap 
we used cash on hand to pay down this portion of our revolving credit debt during the first  second  and third quarters of fiscal as a result  changes in the fair value of the instrument were recorded through earnings from the point in time that the revolving credit facility balance was reduced below the interest rate swap s notional amount of million  which was during the first quarter of fiscal changes associated with the ineffective interest rate swap recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal were approximately million of income and are comprised of amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive loss over the life of the ineffective swap of million offset by income of million related to fair value changes in the ineffective swap liability 
changes associated with the ineffective interest rate swap recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal were approximately million and were comprised of a non cash million pro rata reduction to accumulated other comprehensive loss with an offsetting charge to earnings related to reducing our borrowings outstanding by million  amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive loss over the life of the ineffective swap of million  and income of million related to fair value changes since the date of the reduction 
the remaining amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized over the remaining month term of the interest rate swap and recorded as interest expense 
any further reductions in borrowings under our revolving credit facility will result in a pro rata reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the payment date with a corresponding charge recorded to interest expense 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the unrealized losses related to our interest rate swap measured at fair value in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of january  in thousands balance at january  changes associated with ineffective interest rate swap recorded to interest expense balance at january  the fair value of our ineffective swap liability at january  and january  was million and million  respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves  inventory valuation  fair value measurements  impairment of long lived assets  and income taxes 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on 
table of contents shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all revenues are recorded at gross 
the key indicators used to determine when and how revenue is recorded are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment and all other aspects of the customer relationship 
title passes to bluelinx  and we carry all risk of loss related to warehouse  reload inventory and inventory shipped directly from vendors to our customers 
we are responsible for all product returns 
we control the selling price for all channels 
we select the supplier 
we bear all credit risk 
in addition  we provide inventory to certain customers through pre arranged agreements on a consignment basis 
customer consigned inventory is maintained and stored by certain customers  however  ownership and risk of loss remains with us 
when the inventory is sold by the customer  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for each of the reported periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will ultimately be uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we include all charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventory to its existing condition and location 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged  excess and obsolete inventory 
the damaged  excess and obsolete reserve generally includes discontinued items or inventory that has turn days in excess of days  excluding new items during their product launch 
fair value measurements we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  which may affect our operating results and financial position 
when deemed appropriate  we minimize our risks from interest rate fluctuations through the use of an interest rate swap 
this derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the swap is valued using a valuation model that has inputs other than quoted market prices that are both observable and unobservable 

table of contents we endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
to determine fair value of the interest rate swap we used the discounted estimated future cash flows methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value in the period were i the present value factors used in determining fair value ii projected libor  and iii the risk of counterparty non performance risk 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management 
we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate swap is a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the level measurement is the risk of counterparty non performance on the interest rate swap liability that is not secured by cash collateral 
the affect of counterparty non performance was immaterial during fiscal and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we consider whether there were indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses  management s decision to exit a facility  reductions in the fair market value of real properties and changes in other circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual distribution facility 
in the event of indicators of impairment  the assets of the distribution facility are evaluated by comparing the facility s undiscounted cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset  which ranges between years  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the estimated fair market value 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows is subject to assumptions that affect estimated operating income at a distribution facility level 
these assumptions are related to future sales  margin growth rates  economic conditions  market competition and inflation 
in the event that undiscounted cash flows does not exceed the carrying value of a facility  our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals and our experience with related market transactions 
we use a two year average of cash flows based on ebitda and projected ebitda  which includes a small growth factor assumption  to estimate undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions used to determine impairment are considered to be level measurements in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we experienced improvement in fiscal operating income when compared to fiscal at the distribution facility 
however  our operating results continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing downturn in the housing market 
to the extent that reductions in volume and operating income have resulted in impairment indicators  in all cases our carrying values continue to be less than our projected undiscounted cash flows 
as such  we have not identified significant known trends impacting the fair value of long lived assets to an extent that would indicate impairment 
income taxes as of january   our deferred income tax assets were million with a full valuation allowance 
deferred income tax assets and income tax benefits are recognized for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred 
table of contents income tax assets  we considered the four sources of taxable income that should be considered when determining whether a valuation allowance is required including from least to most subjective taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating and non operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
substantial changes in these assumptions could result in changes in our judgments around our ability to realize future tax benefit 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which will require that the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments be included in interim financial statements 
this guidance also requires entities to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments on an interim and annual basis and to highlight any changes from prior periods 
this guidance was effective for us during the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on subsequent events that establishes authoritative accounting and disclosure guidance for recognized and non recognized subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the guidance also requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this guidance was effective for us beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  and was applied prospectively 
in february  the fasb issued guidance which removes the requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated in both originally issued and reissued financial statements for sec filers 
we have adopted this amendment  which is effective immediately 
in july  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states gaap 
the codification does not change current united states gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative united states gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the form k beginning in the year ending january  and all subsequent public filings will reference the codification as the sole source of authoritative literature 
in january  the fasb amended fair value measurement guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurement  including the amount of transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for transfers in or out of level of the fair value hierarchy and activity for recurring level measures 
in addition the amendments clarify certain existing disclosure requirements related to the level at which fair value disclosures should be disaggregated  and the requirement to provide disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities classified as levels or this guidance is effective for periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements 
these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
this guidance did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on our current year financial statements and disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to 
table of contents perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity must consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating an impairment may exist 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  this guidance is effective for our fiscal year ending december  we do not have goodwill recorded on the balance sheet and therefore this guidance does not currently impact us 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which clarifies that  when presenting comparative financial statements  sec registrants should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current period business combinations had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
this guidance is directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance is effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
this guidance is therefore effective for acquisitions made after the beginning of our fiscal year ending december  we expect that this guidance may impact our disclosures for any future business combinations  but the effect will depend on acquisitions that may be made in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a variety of practices to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading  and are not used to address risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
we record derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risk exposure 
interest rates 
our revolving credit facility accrues interest based on a floating benchmark rate the prime rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
a change in interest rates under the revolving credit facility would have an impact on our results of operations 
however  a change of basis points in the market rate of interest would have an immaterial impact based on borrowings outstanding at january  additionally  to the extent changes in interest rates impact the housing market  we would be impacted by such changes 
on june   certain special purpose entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ours entered into a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate of 
by entering into this fixed rate mortgage  we insulated ourselves from changes in market interest rates on a portion of our indebtedness 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated 
foreign exchange rates 
less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and we do not believe our total exposure to currency fluctuations to be significant 
commodity prices 
we believe that general inflation did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and may do so in the future
