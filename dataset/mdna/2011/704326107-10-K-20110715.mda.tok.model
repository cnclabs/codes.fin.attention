service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients  checks or transactions per client per pay period  and utilization of ancillary services 
we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance by providing high quality  timely  accurate  and affordable services  growing our client base  increasing utilization of our ancillary services  leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure  and expanding our service offerings 
our financial results for fiscal reflected year over year growth 
we continued to see improvement in many of our key business indicators  especially in checks per client 
checks per client increased for fiscal  compared to a decline of for fiscal checks per client began to show year over year growth in the three months ending may  with growth for that quarter and continued to improve throughout fiscal  reflecting increases of    and for each of the sequential quarters 
our revenue growth has been modest  as new sales units were relatively flat compared to the prior year  largely due to lack of growth in new business starts 
our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment 
the equity markets hit a low in march  with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time 
the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to since december our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal we continue to manage our headcount and expenses while investing in our business  particularly in areas related to selling and servicing our clients  product development  and the technology required to support these areas 
we believe these investments are critical to our success 
looking to the future  we continue to focus on investing in our products  people  and service capabilities  positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth 
highlights of our financial results for fiscal compared to fiscal are as follows payroll service revenue increased to billion 
human resource services revenue increased to million 
interest on funds held for clients decreased to million 
total revenue increased to billion 
operating income increased to million  and operating income  net of certain items  increased to million 
refer to the non gaap financial measure discussion on page for further information on operating income  net of certain items 
operating income for fiscal reflected an expense charge of million to increase the litigation reserve related to the rapid payroll court decision  which reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal by per share 
net income and diluted earnings per share increased to million and per share  respectively 

table of contents cash flow from operations increased to million  primarily related to the increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
dividends of million were paid to stockholders  representing of net income 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisition of two software as a service companies  opening up additional areas of the markets we serve 
surepayroll  inc surepayroll  a provider of payroll processing for small businesses  was acquired on february  for million  net of cash acquired 
surepayroll serves small businesses with its easy to use  online payroll product and mobile application 
this acquisition allows us entry into a new area of the online payroll market  and provides our clients with a mobile self service alternative 
the acquisition of surepayroll was dilutive to fiscal by less than per share 
eplan services  inc eplan  a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace  was acquired on may  for million  net of cash acquired 
both entities now operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of paychex 
our financial results include the results of these entities from their respective dates of acquisition 
neither acquisition is significant to our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measure in addition to reporting operating income  a united states us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure  we present operating income  net of certain items  which is a non gaap measure 
we believe operating income  net of certain items  is an appropriate additional measure  as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period 
it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year s targets and measuring management s performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards 
operating income  net of certain items  excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal to increase the litigation reserve 
interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates  which are not within the control of management 
the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature 
it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period 
operating income  net of certain items  is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission 
as such  it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and  therefore  should not be used in isolation  but in conjunction with the gaap measure 
the use of any non gaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies 
operating income  net of certain items  increased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal business outlook our client base was approximately  clients as of may   compared to approximately  clients as of may   and approximately  clients as of may  our client base increased for fiscal  compared to declines of for fiscal and for fiscal excluding the impact of  surepayroll clients  our client base would have declined for fiscal this reduction reflects the impact of lack of growth in new business starts on our client base  as our new sales units were relatively flat compared to fiscal on a positive note  our sales to clients who previously utilized the services of local and regional competitors improved for fiscal for fiscal  payroll services client retention was approximately of our beginning client base  a two percentage point improvement over the prior year  as clients lost decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in client losses was largely attributable to fewer clients going out of business or having no employees for fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we lost fewer clients to local and regional competitors for fiscal through our focus on providing high quality service to our customers to maximize client retention  we received the highest client satisfaction results in the past several years 

table of contents ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and  therefore  are beneficial to our operating margin 
the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings as of may  paychex hr solutions client employees paychex hr solutions clients insurance services clients health and benefits services applicants retirement services clients includes paychex hr essentials as of may  includes workers compensation insurance services clients and health and benefits services clients

in fiscal  we made investments in our sales force and product development 
our sales force increased to  sales representatives for fiscal  and is expected to grow to  sales representatives for the fiscal year ending may  fiscal 
this growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other human resource services offerings 
we have continued to expand our enhanced payroll processing platform to include additional service offerings 
this new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients 
our enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within our operations  contributing to the increase in our operating income  net of certain items  as a percentage of service revenue to for fiscal  compared to for the prior year 
over the next few years  we will continue to invest in our product development  as we believe it is critical to our success 
we have introduced new product offerings to add value for our clients 
in fiscal  we introduced paychex hr essentials  an aso offering that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee related topics 
we also introduced paychex smarttime tm time clocks for small businesses 
this self contained system offers small businesses an economical  easy to use time and attendance solution that automatically collects and calculates employee hours  and integrates with paychex payroll 
we continued the expansion of our insurance services nationwide  simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers 
we now service over  clients through our subsidiary  paychex insurance agency  inc we believe insurance services is an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth 
we strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties 
we provide free webinars  white papers  and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes 
in addition  the paychex insurance agency  inc website  www 
paychexinsurance 
com  helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage 
financial position and liquidity the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices 
despite this macroeconomic environment  as of may   our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal 
yields on high quality financial instruments remain low  negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments 
we invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds  pre refunded bonds  which are secured by a us government escrow  and essential services revenue bonds 
our primary short term investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes 
starting in november  we began to invest in select a p rated variable rate demand notes vrdns and have gradually increased our investment in vrdns to million as of may  during fiscal  we earned an after tax rate of approximately for vrdns compared to approximately for us agency discount notes 

table of contents we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings 
we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
all investments held as of may  were traded in active markets 
our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal historically  we have funded our operations  capital purchases  business acquisitions  and dividend payments from our operating activities 
our positive cash flows in fiscal allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders 
during fiscal  dividends paid to stockholders were of net income 
it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years   and  and our financial position as of may   refer to the tables and analysis in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item and the discussion in the critical accounting policies section of this item outlook our outlook for fiscal is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes 
consistent with our policy regarding guidance  our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates 
our fiscal guidance reflects anticipated results for surepayroll and eplan 
the anticipated service revenue impact is approximately and the earnings dilution is expected to be approximately per share  mainly due to amortization of acquired intangible assets 
our fiscal guidance is as follows low high payroll service revenue human resource services revenue total service revenue interest on funds held for clients investment income  net net income operating income  net of certain items  as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from to for fiscal the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate for fiscal interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal are expected to be impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment 
the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be for fiscal as of may   the long term investment portfolio had an average yield to maturity of and an average duration of years 
in the next twelve months  slightly more than of this portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 
investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations  though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal for business acquisitions 
under normal financial market conditions  the impact to our earnings from a basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would be in the range of million to million  after taxes  for a twelve month period 
such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 
purchases of property and equipment for fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million 
this includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development 
fiscal depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of million to million  and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
intangible assets acquired from surepayroll and eplan are expected to increase amortization expense for fiscal  partially offset by the impact of fully amortized intangibles

we did not hold any vrdns as of may  payroll service revenue payroll service revenue increased to billion for fiscal  compared to a decline for fiscal fiscal revenue benefited from an increase in checks per client and revenue per check 
checks per client increased for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue per check was positively impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and price increases 
our client base  excluding the impact of surepayroll  declined during fiscal this was largely attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units from lack of growth in new business starts 
client retention improved for fiscal  with client losses that were lower than for fiscal  largely a result of fewer clients going out of business or having no employees 
in addition  fiscal new sales units and client losses related to local and regional competitors improved compared to the prior year 
the decrease in payroll service revenue for fiscal was as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume 
our client base decreased during fiscal and checks per client decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
human resource services revenue growth for both fiscal and fiscal was impacted by the revenue earned from stromberg time and attendance operations stromberg  an immaterial component of paychex  prior to its sale in october in addition  retirement services revenue growth for fiscal was impacted by billings in fiscal related to restatements of clients retirement plans required by statute  which are not expected to recur for approximately six years 
this favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal by million and did not recur in fiscal excluding the impact of stromberg in both fiscal and fiscal  and the impact of retirement plan restatement billings for fiscal  human resource services revenue growth would have been as follows change human resource services revenue  as reported human resource services revenue excluding stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings 
table of contents this growth was generated from the following in billions as of may  change change paychex hr solutions client employees paychex hr solutions clients insurance services clients health and benefits services applicants retirement services clients asset value of retirement services client employees funds includes paychex hr essentials as of may  includes workers compensation insurance services clients and health and benefits services clients 
includes eplan as of may  excluding eplan clients  retirement services clients would have increased for fiscal human resource services revenue growth for fiscal reflects modest improvements in economic conditions  the client growth noted above  and price increases 
paychex hr solutions revenue for fiscal was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees 
contributing to this growth in clients and client employees is our new product offering  paychex hr essentials 
growth in certain products that are primarily beneficial to our mms clients contributed positively to human resource services revenue growth for both fiscal and fiscal also  insurance services revenue continued to grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits services and workers compensation insurance services revenue 
health and benefits services revenue continued its accelerated growth since inception  increasing for fiscal and for fiscal  driven primarily by the number of applicants 
somewhat offsetting these positive factors  fluctuations in our peo revenue had an adverse impact on human resource services revenue growth for fiscal peo net service revenue is more variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as healthcare rates change 
for fiscal  client growth as noted above positively impacted human resource services revenue  however  the rates of growth were adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base 
this particularly affected retirement services  although client growth for retirement services rebounded somewhat late in fiscal as client losses improved compared to the prior year 
in fiscal and fiscal  the and increases in the asset value of retirement services client employees funds were driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to paychex 
for both fiscal and fiscal  retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers 
total service revenue total service revenue increased for fiscal and declined for fiscal  attributable to the factors previously discussed 
interest on funds held for clients the decrease of in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned  offset somewhat by an increase in average investment balances 
the decrease of in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances  offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities 
average investment balances for funds held for clients increased for fiscal and decreased for fiscal the increase in average investment balances for fiscal was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the calendar year and the increase in checks per client  offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base 
the decline in average investment balances for fiscal was the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client 
table of contents base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the american recovery and reinvestment act of the economic stimulus package 
in the second half of fiscal  the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the calendar year 
the economic stimulus package went into effect in april  and its impact on year over year comparisons of average investment balances had abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal this factor  along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates  resulted in average investment balances for funds held for clients growing for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal refer to the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k  for more information on changing interest rates 
combined operating and sg a expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal years in millions change change compensation related expenses facilities expenses depreciation and amortization other expenses expense charge to increase the litigation reserve total operating and sg a expenses during fiscal  we recorded an expense charge of million to increase our litigation reserve 
refer to note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional information on legal matters 
excluding the aforementioned million expense charge  combined operating and sg a expenses increased for fiscal and decreased for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily driven by personnel related costs  in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and k match as indicated below 
in addition  we continued to invest in our product development and supporting technology 
improvements in productivity with related lower headcount in operations have moderated this increase 
fiscal compensation related expenses include one time costs related to the separation agreement entered into during the three months ended august  with jonathan j 
judge  our former president and chief executive officer 
expenses of surepayroll and eplan  which are included in our results since their respective acquisition dates  further impacted the growth in operating and sg a expenses 
the decline in combined operating and sg a expenses for fiscal was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount  offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force  customer service  and product development and supporting technology 
in fiscal  we saved approximately million from a freeze on salary increases and providing no matching contributions to our k plan 
we reinstituted salary increases beginning march  and reinstated a k match effective january  as of may   we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  employees as of may  and  employees as of may  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business 
amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions  which are amortized using either straight line or accelerated methods 
depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal due to the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan 
other expenses include items such as delivery  forms and supplies  communications  travel and entertainment  professional services  and other costs incurred to support our business 
the increase in other expenses for fiscal was primarily attributable to the largely fourth quarter impact from our two acquisitions 

table of contents operating income operating income increased for fiscal and declined for fiscal the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed

investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients  which is included in total revenue 
the increase of in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of higher average invested balances and a slight increase in average interest rates earned 
the increase in average investment balances for fiscal was the result of investment of cash generated from operations  partially offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during the second half of fiscal the increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer term investment portfolio compared to the prior year 
the decrease of in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal  and for fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to lower tax exempt income on available for sale securities during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes 
refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional disclosures on income taxes 
net income and earnings per share net income increased to million for fiscal and decreased to million for fiscal diluted earnings per share increased to per share for fiscal and decreased to per share for fiscal these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed 
in particular  the million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by per share for fiscal combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal decreased or million  reducing diluted earnings per share by per share 
liquidity and capital resources the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices 
despite this macroeconomic environment  our financial position as of may  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
we also believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations lines of credit as of may   we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february bank of america  na million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 
the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary 
no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal or as of may  jp morgan chase bank  na and bank of america  na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit  which are discussed below 
letters of credit as of may   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million  required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies 
the letters of credit expire at various dates between july and december  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios 
no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal or as of may  subsequent to may   the letter of credit expiring in july was renewed and will expire in july other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that  under gaap  are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may  payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations 
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations 
included in the total purchase obligations is million of commitments to purchase capital assets 
amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately million as of may  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for more information on income taxes 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 
we are currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years ended may  through on july   we received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the new york state department of taxation and finance  which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of may  the outcome 
table of contents of the audit and the timing of settlement  if any  are subject to significant uncertainty 
it is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact  if any  if resolution is ultimately unfavorable to us 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage payroll services inc advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices associates  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services 
under these arrangements  advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients 
when we acquired advantage  there were fifteen associates 
over the past few years  some arrangements with various associates have been discontinued  and there are currently fewer than ten associates 
since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain  obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above 
commission expense for the associates for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
historically  there have been no material losses related to such guarantees 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  which require us to defend and  if necessary  indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 
we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party 
we currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans 
our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
historically  the amounts accrued have not been material 
we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability  errors and omissions  warranty liability  theft and embezzlement  and acts of terrorism  and capacity for deductibles and self insured retentions through our captive insurance company 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
we do maintain investments as a limited partner in low income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than of our total assets as of may  operating cash flow activities year ended may  in millions net income non cash adjustments to net income cash provided by used in changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal resulted mainly from an increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal related primarily to lower net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in non cash adjustments to net income in fiscal is primarily due to the million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve  partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit 
the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation  peo payroll  income tax  and other liabilities 

table of contents investing cash flow activities year ended may  in millions net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities purchases of property and equipment  net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment acquisition sale of businesses purchases of other assets net cash used in provided by investing activities funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
the fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments 
as a result of volatility in the financial markets  in september we divested of any vrdn securities held and began to utilize us agency discount notes as our primary short term investment vehicle 
us agency discount notes are cash equivalents 
vrdns  although priced and traded as short term securities  are classified as available for sale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities 
as a result of the divestiture  the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities exceeded the purchases of available for sale securities in fiscal much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio 
in november  we began to again invest in select a p rated vrdns  although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year 
we utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these vrdns  and in fiscal these purchases of available for sale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of available for sale securities 
also in fiscal  more corporate funds have been invested in longer term municipal bonds 
in fiscal  we continued to increase our investment in vrdns and the amounts of purchases and sales for available for sale securities increased 
however  partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing within the funds held for clients portfolio of remittances versus collections 
see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 
in general  fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases  sales  or maturities of investments 
the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds  and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services 
additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k 
purchases of long lived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth  purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software  and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities 
during fiscal years   and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation 
the chairman  president  and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the board 
during fiscal  we paid million for the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan 
during fiscal  we received million from the sale of stromberg  an immaterial component of the company 
the purchases of other assets were for customer lists 

table of contents financing cash flow activities year ended may  in millions  except per share amounts net change in client fund obligations dividends paid proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock based awards net cash used in financing activities cash dividends per common share net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds  and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services 
collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the outflow of funds for fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the federal holiday on may   offset by an increase in client fund obligations for higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for calendar year as a result of may  being a federal holiday  client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday  may  that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june this resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal also  for fiscal there was an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the calendar year 
may  did not fall on a federal holiday  so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal dividends paid a quarterly dividend of per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal years   and the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled   and for those respective fiscal years 
the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 
exercise of stock options proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock based awards increased for fiscal and decreased for fiscal as compared to the respective prior years 
common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were million shares for each of fiscal years   and the increase for fiscal was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional disclosures on our stock based compensation incentive plans 
other recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements at this time  we do not anticipate that recently issued accounting guidance that has not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred were billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal  and billion for fiscal revenue from stromberg time and attendance solutions was recognized during fiscal and fiscal until the date of disposition  when all of the following were present persuasive evidence that an arrangement existed  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery was complete for the software and hardware  the fee was fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility was reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts were generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts was recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting  holding  and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
our maximum individual claims liability was million under both the fiscal and fiscal policies 
as of may  and may   we had recorded current liabilities of million and million  respectively  and long term liabilities of million and million  respectively  for workers compensation claims 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million and million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may  and may   respectively  resulting from acquisitions of 
table of contents businesses 
the increase in goodwill was due to the acquisition in fiscal of two software as a service companies  whose results are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter 
based on the results of our reviews  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal year  or subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation costs all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility 
expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 
we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change  and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards 
we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements  we must conclude that tax positions must be more likely than not to be sustained  assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after 
table of contents examination by taxing authorities 
if a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment  and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit 
a change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions was million as of may  and million as of may  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities 
we follow an investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal 
we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings  with more than of our portfolio rated aa or better 
we invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds  pre refunded bonds  which are secured by a us government escrow  and essential services revenue bonds 
we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
all investments held as of may  were traded in active markets 
starting in november we began to invest in select a p rated vrdns and have gradually increased our investment in vrdns to million as of may   up from million as of may  during fiscal  we earned an after tax rate of approximately for vrdns compared to approximately for us agency discount notes  which have been our primary short term investment vehicle 
we have no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities  sub prime mortgage securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was  compared with for fiscal and for fiscal when interest rates are falling  the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and long term interest rate changes 
during a falling interest rate environment  the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments  and over time decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of years  would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
in the next twelve months  slightly more than of our available for sale portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 

table of contents the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  amortized fair in millions cost value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically to years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 
the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year the federal funds rate was a range of zero to as of may   may   and may  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous  and financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 
subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of less than days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 

table of contents the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of million as of may   compared with an unrealized gain of million as of may  in determining fair value  we utilize the interactive data pricing service 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from million to million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from million to million 
the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and as of may  and may   respectively 
the weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may  and may  assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value 
this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary and an impairment loss recognized 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that the investments we held as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired 
while million of our available for sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost  we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms  and that the unrealized loss of million was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns 
all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may  and may  held an aa rating or better 
we intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity  and further believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment
