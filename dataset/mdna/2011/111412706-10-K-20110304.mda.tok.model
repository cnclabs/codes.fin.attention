overview since  broadvision has been a pioneer and consistent innovator of e business solutions 
we deliver a combination of technologies and services into the global market that enable customers of all sizes to power mission critical web initiatives that ultimately deliver high value to their bottom line 
our offering consists of a robust framework for personalization and self service  modular applications and agile toolsets that customers use to create e commerce  portal solutions  and enterprise social networks 
as of december   we had licensed our products to about companies including baker hughes  epson  fiat  ww grainger  hilti  iberia  indian railways catering and tourism company  sina  sony  us navy  vodafone  and xerox 
our objective is to further our position as a global supplier of web based  self service applications 
this will require us to continue to build new functionality into our applications that offer our customers a compelling value proposition to license our products rather than design and build custom solutions 
we generate revenue from fees for licenses of our software products and related maintenance  consulting services and customer training 
we generally charge fees for licenses of our software products based on the number of persons registered to use the product  the number of cpus utilized by the machines on which the product is installed  or usage of saas software as a service  a software model in which vendors host software that customers access remotely 
payment terms are generally days from the date the software products are delivered  the maintenance or subscription contracts are booked  or the consulting services are provided 
from to  we incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations 
in fiscal years and  we incurred significant cash usage related to the termination of excess real estate obligations  certain reductions in workforce and the execution and subsequent termination of an acquisition agreement 
we generated net income in year  and  and net loss in year and our ability to generate profits or positive cash flows in future periods remains uncertain 
our operations in faced three major challenges severe worldwide recession  continued consolidation of the enterprise software industry  and maturity of our major revenue generating products 
consequently  revenues declined significantly as compared to previous years 
we managed these challenges by rigorously controlling costs  diligently caring for and serving our installed base to improve customer loyalty  and heavily investing in new products  most notably the cloud based clearvale enterprise social network 
we made important progresses with clearvale in  including in research and development  general availability of new versions of clearvale saas  and channel development 
clearvale did not generate material revenue in it will take time for revenue from sales of clearvale to grow 
we strive to anticipate changes in the demand for our services  and manage our costs appropriately 
as part of our budgeting process  cross functional management participates in the planning  reviewing and managing of our business plans 
this process is intended to allow us to adjust our cost structures to changing market needs  competitive landscapes and economic factors

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates this management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivable reserves  stock based compensation  investments  income taxes and restructuring  as well as contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview our revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products  maintenance  consulting services and customer training 
we generally charge fees for licenses of our software products either based on the number of persons using the product or based on the number of cpus on which the product is installed 
licenses for software for which fees are charged based upon the number of persons using the product include licenses for development use and licenses for use by registered users of the customer website deployment use 
licenses for software for which fees are charged on a per cpu basis differentiate between development and deployment usage 
our revenue recognition policies comply with accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition asc  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we apply the separation criteria in asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  to determine whether our arrangements with multiple deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting 
asc indicates that revenue recognized for any multiple element contract is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element 
the determination of the fair value of each element is based on our analysis of objective evidence from comparable sales of the individual element 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
for the fixed or not to exceed fees contracts  revenues are recognized based on asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts asc 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts on a basis of utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
software license revenue we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers and application service providers asp 
in general  software license revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
in case of electronic delivery  delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
for products that cannot be used without a licensing key  the delivery requirement is met when the licensing key is made available to the customer 
if collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
subscription based license revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of list prices 
we do not grant resellers the right of return 
we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of asc revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as licenses for software products  maintenance  consulting services or customer training 
the determination of fair value is based on vendor specific objective evidence  which is specific to us 
we limit our assessment of objective evidence for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we have not yet adopted accounting standards update asu an update to asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asu  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we will apply asu on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on or after january  we have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements if any  upon the adoption of asu we record unearned revenue for software license agreements when cash has been received from the customer and the agreement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy 
we record accounts receivable for software license agreements when the agreement qualifies for revenue recognition but cash or other consideration has not been received from the customer 
services revenue consulting services revenues and customer training revenues are recognized as such services are performed 
maintenance revenues  which include revenues bundled with software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to our products  are deferred and recognized ratably over the related agreement period  generally twelve months 
our consulting services  which consist of consulting  maintenance and training  are delivered through the worldwide e business solution organization webso 
the services that we provide are not essential to the functionality of the software 
we record reimbursement from our customers for out of pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues 

table of contents receivable reserves occasionally  our customers experience financial difficulty after we record the sale but before payment has been received 
we maintain receivable reserves for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our normal payment terms are generally to days from the invoice date 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make the contractual payments  additional reserves may be required 
losses from customer receivables in the two year period ended december   have not been significant 
if all efforts to collect a receivable fail  and the receivable is considered uncollectible  we would write off against the receivable reserve 
research and development and software development costs asc  costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed asc  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model 
to date  costs incurred by us between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant 
accordingly  we have charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred 
income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  is not expected to be realized 
we analyze our deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization 
we have established a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent that management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization 
we consider the effects of estimated future taxable income  current economic conditions and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
under asc  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we adopted the alternative transition method provided in asc for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to asc in the fourth quarter of fiscal the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of asc the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we did not recognize any significant share based employee compensation costs in our statements of operations prior to january   as options granted to employees and non employee members of the board of directors generally had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
prior to the adoption of asc  we provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss applicable to common stockholders as if the fair value based method had been applied 
in the pro forma information for periods prior to  we accounted for pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
our operating results for prior periods have not been restated 
further details related to our stock benefit plans and our adoption of asc are provided in note stockholders equity deficit in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring through december   we have approved restructuring plans to  among other things  reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities 
restructuring and asset impairment charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of i lease termination costs and or costs associated with permanently vacating our facilities  and ii other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan 
we account for each of these costs in accordance with asc  exit or disposal of cost obligations asc 
excess facilities costs 
we account for excess facilities costs as follows for exit or disposal activities  we account for lease termination and or abandonment costs in accordance with asc  which requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured initially at fair value on the cease use date of the facility 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings to date  the majority of estimates made by management have related to charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charges for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates have related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce our lease obligations 
we based our estimates of sublease income  in part  current market conditions and rental rates  an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
we have recorded the low end of a range of assumptions modeled for restructuring charges 
adjustments to the facilities accrual will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations in current operations based on management most current estimates 
further details related to our restructuring charges and activities are provided in note restructuring in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
