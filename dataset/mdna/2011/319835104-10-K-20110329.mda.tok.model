item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview first community corporation is a one bank holding company headquartered in lexington  south carolina 
we operate from our main office in lexington  south carolina and our full service offices located in lexington two  forest acres  irmo  cayce west columbia  gilbert  chapin  northeast columbia  prosperity  newberry and camden 
during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of dekalb bankshares  inc  the holding company for the bank of camden 
the merger added one office in kershaw county located in the midlands of south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first acquisition of another financial institution when we merged with dutchfork bancshares  inc  the holding company for newberry federal savings bank 
the merger added three offices in newberry county 
in  our college street office in newberry was consolidated with our wilson road office in newberry 
we engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision making  emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium sized businesses  professional concerns and individuals 
the following discussion describes our results of operations for as compared to as compared to  and also analyzes our financial condition as of december  as compared to december  like most community banks  we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
a primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during  and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the years shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this noninterest income  as well as our noninterest expense  in the following discussion 
the discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report 

table of contents on october   the treasury announced the cpp under the eesa  pursuant to which the treasury could make senior preferred stock investments in participating financial institutions that qualifies as tier i capital 
based on our risk weighted assets as of september   we were eligible to issue up to million in new senior preferred stock under the program 
on november   as part of the cpp established by the treasury under the eesa  first community corporation entered into the cpp purchase agreement with the treasury dated november  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the treasury i the series t preferred stock and ii the cpp warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the proceeds from this offering qualify as tier capital under the regulatory capital guidelines 
cumulative dividends on the series t preferred stock accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years  and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but will be paid only if  as  and when declared by the company board of directors 
the series t preferred stock has no maturity date and ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company 
the series t preferred stock generally is non voting 
under the terms of the agreement the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par after february  prior to this date  the company may redeem the series t preferred stock at par if i the company has raised aggregate gross proceeds in one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the cpp purchase agreement in excess of approximately million  and ii the aggregate redemption price does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds from such qualified equity offerings 
the recovery act signed by the president on february  amended the terms of the agreement and allows the company to redeem the series t preferred stock prior to february  any redemption is subject to the consent of the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
recent regulatory development on april   the bank entered into the formal agreement with the occ  our primary bank regulator 
the formal agreement is based on the findings of the occ during a on site examination of the bank 
as reflected in the formal agreement  the occ primary concern with the bank is driven by the rating agencies downgrades of non agency mortgage backed securities mbs in its investment portfolio 
these securities  purchased in through  were all rated aaa by the rating agencies at the time of purchase  however  they have been impacted by the economic recession and the stress on the residential housing sector 
these ratings do not reflect the discounted purchase price paid by the bank 
they only reflect their analysis of the performance of the security overall  and therefore  a downgrade does not capture the risk of loss to the bank 
the formal agreement did not require any adjustment to the bank balance sheet or income statement  nor did it change the bank well capitalized status 
the occ has  however  separately established the following individual minimum capital ratios for the bank a tier leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   the bank exceeds each of these ratios and remains well capitalized 
the board of directors has appointed an independent compliance committee made up of directors to monitor and report on compliance with the terms of the formal agreement 
the bank intends to take all actions necessary to enable it to comply with the requirements of the formal agreement  and as of the date hereof management has submitted all documentation required as of this date to the occ 
there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to comply fully with the provisions of the formal agreement  and the determination of our compliance will be made by the occ 
however  management believes the bank is currently in compliance with all provisions of the formal agreement 
failure to meet the requirements of the formal agreement could result in additional regulatory requirements  which could result in regulators taking additional enforcement actions against the bank 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  the impact of current events  and conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation and recognition of other than temporary impairment otti on certain investments including our private label mortgage backed securities and other corporate debt security holdings requires significant judgment and estimates 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the evaluation of otti include projected cash flows including prepayment assumptions  default rates and severities of losses on the underlying collateral within the security 
under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions  the actual otti recognized by us may be different from the actual amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for the disclosure of certain of the assumptions used as well as otti recognized in the financial statements during the years ended december   and results of operations our net income was million  or diluted earnings per common share  for the year ended december   as compared to net loss of million  or diluted loss per common share  for the year ended december   and a net loss of million  or diluted loss per common share  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we returned to profitability after two years of net losses which were primarily a result of two specific transactions one occurring in and one in each of which are discussed in the following paragraphs below 
during the year ended december   we were able to improve our net interest income and the related net interest margin 
we continued to control the growth in assets by reducing funding from brokered certificates of deposits and other borrowings 
as a result of the continued slow economic recovery  loan demand remained very weak throughout loans decreased by million at december  as compared to december  average loan balances were relatively flat during at million as compared to million in during the year ended december   we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or per diluted share  that represented the complete write off of our goodwill intangible 
goodwill resulted from business acquisitions and represented the value attributable to 
table of contents unidentifiable intangible elements in the businesses acquired 
the analysis and valuation which was performed in the third quarter resulted in our determination that goodwill was impaired 
this determination was reflective of the impact of the then and ongoing economic environment and its effect on the banking industry and our company 
the calculation of fair value as part of the goodwill impairment test is subject to significant management judgment and estimates 
industry wide  market capitalization and acquisition multiples had significantly declined since and  which are the dates of the acquisition of dutchfork bankshares and dekalb bancshares  respectively 
our company experienced the same trend  with a decline in its market price per share and an extended period of time trading at a discount to book value and tangible book value 
this non cash charge represented the accounting recognition of the events 
given the non cash nature of a goodwill charge  this non interest expense item had no adverse impact upon our regulatory capital  liquidity position  operating performance or our prospects for future earnings 
there was no tax benefit recognized as a result of this goodwill impairment charge 
the net loss for the year ended december  included a charge to recognize an otti in the amount of million on our investment in a preferred stock issue of freddie mac a gse reflecting a write down of substantially all of its carrying value 
during the second quarter of  we made a decision to recognize an unrealized mark to market loss on the security that at that time was rated investment grade in the amount of million as an otti based on the significant decline in the market value of the security caused by potential deterioration of freddie mac financial condition  and the then current lack of clarity about the impact of an announced plan which was approved by the house and senate and signed into law by the president 
that plan provided support for freddie mac as well as other gses 
on september   the secretary of the treasury announced a decision to place freddie mac into conservatorship and as part of that decision the dividend payments on existing preferred shares would be terminated for an unspecified period of time 
as a result of that decision we took an additional million otti charge in the third quarter of to write off substantially all of the remaining investment in this freddie mac security 
the preferred stock issue was purchased in and acquired by first community corporation in the merger with dutchfork bankshares 
as noted above in item under reconciliations  our operating earnings were million  or per diluted common share  for as compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share  for net interest income increased by thousand in from million in to million in the increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin in as compared to the impact of the improvement in net interest margin was somewhat offset by a decrease in average earning assets of million from million during to million in the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  during was as compared to during net interest spread  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in as compared to in see below under net interest income and market risk and interest rate sensitivity for a further discussion about the effect of the increase in net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses was million in as compared to million in non interest income was million in as compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a negative fair value adjustment on an interest rate swap contract  higher other than temporary impairment charges  and less gains on sales of investments in as compared to operating non interest expense see reconciliation above increased to million in as compared to million in as discussed below under non interest income and expense the increase is primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefits of thousand and thousand in other real estate expenses in as compared to our operating earnings see reconciliation above were million  or per diluted common share  for as compared to million  or diluted earnings per common share  for net interest income increased by thousand in from million in to 
table of contents million in the increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the level of average earning assets 
average earning assets equaled million during as compared to million during the effect of the increase in earning assets was offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from during to during on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest spread  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in as compared to in the provision for loan losses was million in as compared to million in non interest income  excluding the fhlmc otti charge of million  was million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily due to a negative fair value adjustment on interest rate contracts of thousand in as compared to a positive adjustment of thousand in operating non interest expense see reconciliation above increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to a substantial increase in the fdic fico premiums from thousand in to million in net interest income net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the yield on earning assets was   and in  and  respectively 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was   and in   and  respectively 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was in  in and in our loan to deposit ratio on average during was  as compared to during and during loans typically provide a higher yield than other types of earning assets and thus one of our goals is to grow the loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets which should improve the overall yield on earning assets and the net interest margin 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio was 
the net interest margin improved in as compared to after two years of declining margins in and starting in early and continuing through  interest rates have been at historic lows 
the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and our cost of funds decreased by basis points in as compared to this resulted in an increase in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to our average borrowings and time deposits  which are typically the higher costing funding source  decreased million and million  respectively  in as compared to during the same period our average transaction accounts interest and non interest bearing  money market accounts and savings deposits increased by million 
this change in the mix of funding sources contributed to the increase in our margin between the two periods 
throughout  time deposits and borrowed funds represented of our total interest bearing funding sources and in these balances represented of our interest bearing funding sources 
in comparing to  the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and our cost of funds decreased by basis points in as compared to this resulted in an increase in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to despite this  our net interest margin decreased basis points as a slightly higher percentage of our average earning assets volume were funded by interest bearing liabilities volume in as compared to in addition  a slight change in the mix of funding sources in as compared to  contributed to the decline in our margin

as previously stated  these sources of funding are typically higher cost funds than alternative sources 
average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following table depicts  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from daily averages

table of contents the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and the amount attributable to changes in rate

the risk of loss can be measured in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
we have established an asset liability management committee alco to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the alco monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the alco has established policy guidelines and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
a monitoring technique employed by us is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
also  asset liability modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
neither the gap analysis or asset liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income including  the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

securities based on amortized cost 
we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement on october  the swap agreement has a million notional amount 
we receive a variable rate of interest on the notional amount based on a three month libor rate and pay a fixed rate interest of 
the contract was entered into to protect us from the negative impact of rising interest rates 
our exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
our exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the changes in the market value of the swap between reporting periods 
at december  and the fair value of the contract was a negative thousand and thousand  respectively 
the fair value adjustment during each reporting period is recognized in other income 
for the years ended december   and the adjustment reflected in earnings amounted to thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the fair value of the contract is the present value  over the remaining term of the contract  of the difference between the estimated swap rate  for the remaining term  as the reporting date multiplied by the notional amount and the fixed interest rate of multiplied by the notional amount of the contract 

table of contents at december   we had an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the cap rate of interest is three month libor 
the cap agreement expired on august  and at december  the agreement had no value 
in the first quarter of  we had a floor agreement with a notional amount of million which was sold and received thousand in cash and recognized a gain in the amount of thousand in other income 
these agreements are entered into to protect assets and liabilities from the negative effects of volatility in interest rates 
the agreements provide for a payment to the bank of the difference between the cap floor rate of interest and the market rate of interest 
the bank exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
the bank exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the market value of the cap and floor 
gains or losses on the value of these interest rate contracts are recognized in earnings on a current basis 
the bank received payments under the terms of the cap contract in the amounts of thousand during the year ended december  the bank recognized thousand in other income to reflect the decrease in the value of the cap contract for the years ended december  through simulation modeling  we monitor the effect that an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points and basis points up and down will have on net interest income over the next months 
based on the many factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates  the following table estimates the hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december  and over the subsequent months 
even though we are liability sensitive  the model at december  reflects a decrease in net interest income in a basis point declining rate environment 
this primarily results from the current level of interest rates being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts 
the interest rates on these accounts are at a level where they cannot be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates 
the increase and decrease of and basis points assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity hypothetical percentage change in net interest income december  change in short term interest rates bp bp flat bp bp we also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the present value of equity pve over a range of changes in market interest rates 
the sensitivity of pve to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon 
at december  and  the pve exposure in a plus basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be and  respectively 
during  we were able to modestly reduce our pve exposure in a rising rate environment 
we continue to reduce our current exposure to increases in interest rates by shortening the lives or repricing periods of our earning assets as well as extending the length of repricing periods on our interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  our provision for 
table of contents loan loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans  the quality  mix  and size of our overall loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower ability to repay  the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans  our historical loan loss experience  and a review of specific problem loans 
we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures  changes in the local national economy  changes in volume or type of credits  changes in volume severity of problem loans  quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit 
periodically  we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period  especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in our market areas 
we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification see note loans 
the annualized weighted average loss ratios over the last months for loans classified substandard  special mention and pass have been approximately  and  respectively 
the allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance 
the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
as a result of the economic downturn beginning in and continuing throughout real estate values have been dramatically impacted 
with our loan portfolio consisting of a large percentage of real estate secured loans we  like most financial institutions  have experienced increasing delinquencies and problem loans 
we are not immune to the continued effects of the recessionary economy and continue to experience some deterioration of our loan portfolio in general as evidenced by the increase in non performing assets from million of total assets at december  to million of total assets at december  and million of total assets at december  while we believe these ratios remain favorable in comparison to current industry results  we are concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local businesses and professionals 
as noted below in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table the unallocated portion of the allowance as a percentage of the total allowance has grown over the last several years 
the allocated portion of the allowance is based on historical loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors as explained above 
the qualitative factors have been established based on certain assumptions made as a result of the current economic conditions and as conditions change are adjusted to be directionally consistent with these changes 
with the ongoing uncertainty in economic conditions and particularly real estate valuations we do not believe it would be prudent to reduce substantially the overall level of our allowance at this time 
as economic conditions show sustainable improvement the unallocated portion of the allowance should decrease as a percentage of the total allowance 
in the near term this percentage may continue to increase slightly 
our company has a significant portion of its loan portfolio with real estate as the underlying collateral 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio had real estate collateral as compared to approximately at december  see note to financial statements for 
table of contents concentrations of credit 
when loans  whether commercial or personal  are granted  they are based on the borrower ability to generate repayment cash flows from income sources sufficient to service the debt 
real estate is generally taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment and as a secondary source of repayment 
during this economic cycle many borrowers traditional income sources have been impacted significantly and real estate values have dropped significantly 
we will continue to work closely with all our borrowers that are experiencing economic problems as a result of this cycle and believe we have the processes in place to monitor and identify problem credits 
until this economic cycle reverses we are likely to continue to experience higher than historical delinquencies and problem loans 
therefore  we anticipate funding our provision for loan losses at levels higher than we have historically experienced 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allowance is also subject to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december    and  we had non accrual loans in the amount of million  million and thousand  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of loans 
all of these loans are considered to be impaired  are substantially all real estate related  and have been measured for impairment under the fair value of the collateral method 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is believed that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
such fair values are obtained using independent appraisals  which we consider to be level inputs 
the aggregate amount of impaired loans was and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the non accrual loans range in size from thousand to million 
the largest relationship is in the amount of million with a mortgage on a developed parking complex near the university of south carolina athletic complex 
in addition to the non accrual loans that are considered to be impaired  we have six loans totaling million that are classified as trouble debt restructurings but are accruing loans as of december  the largest of these is for million 
this loan is collateralized by owner occupied commercial real estate and certain marketable securities 
the debtors cash flow coverage to service the debt has been impacted over the last couple of years and therefore the loan was placed on interest only for a period of time and has subsequently been termed and is amortizing principle and interest on a monthly basis 
due to the collateral coverage on this credit  it is not anticipated that we would incur a material loss in the event the debtor fails to service the debt under the restructured terms 
the other five loans included as troubled debt restructurings range in size from thousand to thousand and have been evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral see note loans  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 
there were million  million  and million in loans delinquent to days at december   and  respectively 
there were thousand  thousand and thousand in loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing interest at december   and  respectively 
our management continuously monitors non performing  classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition of these loans 
we have identified three loans in the amount of thousand which are current as to principal and interest at december  and not included in non performing assets but that could be potential problem loans 
each of these loans are real estate related and range in size from thousand to thousand 
they have been identified as potential problems based on our review that their traditional sources of cash flow have been impacted 
table of contents significantly and they may ultimately not be able to service the debt 
these loans are continually monitored and are considered in our overall evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our allowance for loan losses

table of contents the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each of the past five years 
the allocation is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations 
the entire amount is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial residential consumer unallocated  n a n a n a n a n a total accrual of interest is discontinued on loans when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that a borrower financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest  which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid  is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
our primary source of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts 
in addition  we originate mortgage loans that are pre sold and funded by the third party acquirer  for which we receive a fee 
other sources of noninterest income are derived from investment advisory fees and commissions on non deposit investment products  bankcard fees  atm debit card fees  commissions on check sales  safe deposit box rent  wire transfer and official check fees 
non interest income decreased from million in to million in deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to over the last two years we have experienced fewer items being presented for payment on accounts with insufficient funds and as a result this source of fee income has continued to decline since in addition  changes to regulation e that became effective july  required that customers affirmatively opt in to our overdraft protection program 
to the extent customers who have utilized this product do not opt in  this will reduce fees related to the program that result from atm and point of sale transactions 
it is expected that this regulatory change along with other proposals or recommendations related to overdraft protection programs  mandated limitations on the number of items an institution can charge within established time frames  as well as  the order in which items presented for payment must be processed on accounts  may continue to reduce deposit service charge fees in the future 
mortgage origination fees increased by thousand to million in from thousand in this increase is primarily as a result of an increase in the level of refinancing activity during changes to underwriting and appraisal requirements established by fnma and fhlmc as well as changes in the regulatory environment continue to impact the ability of individuals to qualify for loans

table of contents addition  regulatory changes related to allowable compensation arrangements for loan originators  as well as  new registration requirements for all mortgage loan originators may have an impact on this source of fee income and the cost related to providing these services in the future 
for the year ended december   we had gains on the sale of securities in the amount of thousand  as compared to million in the comparable period of during  we restructured a portion of our available for sale investments 
during the second quarter of  we sold a cdo see note investment securities to our consolidated financial statements for further information  and realized a loss in the amount of million 
approximately million in available for sale gse bonds and mbss were sold that realized a gain of approximately million 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we sold two corporate securities  certain non taxable municipal securities and other gse securities and realized gains of thousand 
the sales and resulting net gains during the last half of were a result of our desire to restructure the portfolio to better position us for a rising rate environment as well as investing in securities that have a lower regulatory risk weighting such as gnma mortgage backed securities and sba pools 
other than temporary impairment charges of thousand credit component on nine private label mortgage backed securities and of million on one pooled trust preferred security were recognized during see note investment securities to our consolidated financial statements for further information

during  we recorded a negative fair value adjustment on an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million in the amount of thousand 
this compares to a positive fair value adjustment of thousand during the interest rate swap was entered into in to protect assets and liabilities from the negative impact in a rising interest rate environment see market risk and interest rate sensitivity discussion 
other noninterest income increased by thousand in as compared to the increase primarily relates to increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees as well as modest increases in other miscellaneous fees 
during  we realized fee income related to atm and debit card usage  to include interchange fees  of approximately thousand 
the impact of the changes to allowable fees assessed will not be known until the final regulatory guidance is issued 
as a result of the otti charge on fllmc preferred stock we had a non interest income loss during of million 
operating non interest income for was million see reconciliation above as compared to million in deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to this decrease in deposit service charges resulted from a continued decline in overdraft fees in as compared to in  we realized gains on the sale of securities in the amount of million 
this gain was partially offset by a thousand loss on the early extinguishment of certain federal home loan bank advances 
we sold approximately million in investments in the fourth quarter of to fund the early extinguishment of million in advances 
the balance of the payoff was funded from short term overnight funds 
the gain on the sale of the investments offset the loss on the paydown of the advances 
other gains realized throughout were realized to take advantage of favorable spreads on certain available for sale securities and shorten the average life of the portfolio 
mortgage origination fees increased by thousand in as compared to continued low interest rates as well as tax credits available to new home buyers increased the volume of loans closed in as compared to in addition  there were fewer mortgage origination alternatives available as compared to prior years due to the ongoing economic cycle causing many origination businesses to close

adjustment to assets and liabilities carried at fair value had a negative impact on non interest income of thousand in whereas it had a positive impact of thousand in see note to financial statements 
other noninterest income increased by thousand in as compared to the increase primarily related to modest increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees  loan late charges as well as other miscellaneous fees 
noninterest expense 
in the very competitive financial services industry  we recognize the need to place a great deal of emphasis on expense management and continually evaluate and monitor growth in discretionary expense categories in order to control future increases 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to goodwill acquired in previous acquisitions see discussion above under results of operations 
operating noninterest expense increased from million in to million in total non interest expense  excluding the goodwill impairment in  increased by million  or   as compared to salary and benefit expense increased thousand from million in to million in the at december  we had full time equivalent employees as compared to full time employees at december  the increase in number of full time equivalent employees  normal salary adjustments made over the last months as well as a lower amount of deferred salary expense resulting from decreased loan originations account for the increase in salary and benefit expense in as compared to fdic insurance assessments decreased  in as compared during the second quarter of  the fdic assessed a one time special assessment on all insured institutions of basis points 
this special assessment amounted to thousand and was expensed in the second quarter of the fdic assessment rate for averaged approximately basis points 
the recently passed financial institution reform legislation broadens the assessment base for calculation of the fdic assessment 
the new assessment base is scheduled to take effect in the second quarter of it is estimated that we will have reduced assessments in the amount of approximately thousand annually when compared to the existing assessment base 
in november  all insured institutions with limited exceptions were required to prepay insurance assessments for a three year period 
our prepayment made in december amounted to approximately million 
at december   the remaining prepaid insurance assessment amounted to million and is included in other assets 
other real estate expense increased to thousand during as compared to thousand in the same period of this is a result of the increased balance of other real estate owned and includes cost associated with foreclosure  force placed insurance coverage as well as property taxes paid on prior year delinquent taxes on these properties 
it is anticipated that these other real estate costs will remain at or near the levels throughout non interest expense other miscellaneous decreased by thousand from thousand in to thousand in operating noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefit expense of thousand and an increase in fdic fico premiums of thousand in as compared to the increase in salary and benefit expenses are a result of normal salary increases and a modest increase in cost of medical insurance provided to employees 
the fdic fico premiums increase resulted from significant increases in the normal assessment rates implemented by the fdic as well as a special assessment in the third quarter of in the amount of approximately thousand 
professional fees and other noninterest expense increased by thousand and thousand  respectively in as compared to these increases are primarily related to additional cost related to loan collection efforts as well as legal fees associated with loan workouts and general increases related to addressing and complying with regulatory changes and issues facing the industry 
marketing and public raelations expenses decreased by thousand in 
table of contents as compared to this decrease was a result of our intentional reduction in this discretionary expense during the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the primary components of noninterest expense year ended december  in thousands salary and employee benefits occupancy equipment marketing and public relations atm debit card processing supplies telephone courier correspondent services fdic fico premium insurance other real estate expenses professional fees loss on limited partnership interest postage director fees amortization of intangibles impairment of goodwill other income tax expense income tax expense for was thousand as compared to income tax expense benefit for the year ended december  of thousand and million for the year ended december  we recognize deferred tax assets for future deductible amounts resulting from differences in the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is then established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
in  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance of thousand primarily related to contribution carryforwards that expired at the end of contribution carry forwards of approximately thousand expired in and the related valuation allowance in the amount of thousand was reversed 
at december   there is a remaining deferred tax valuation reserve in the amount of thousand primarily related to a capital loss carryforward 
the net loss generated during was a result of the impairment of goodwill acquired in tax free acquisitions and therefore is not deductible for income tax purposes 
as previously discussed  we had an otti charge on certain securities of million during the loss is not deductible for federal income tax purposes until the securities are sold or deemed worthless 
therefore  the loss resulted in recognizing a deferred tax asset in the amount of million in the net operating loss carryforward period for federal income taxes is generally years 
any carry forward period related to realized tax losses on these securities will not start until they are sold or deemed worthless 
we have a net operating loss carry forward acquired in the acquisition of dutchfork and dekalb for federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable

financial position assets totaled million at december  as compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
loans at december  were million as compared to million at december  we funded in excess of million of new loan production in  but due to scheduled pay downs during the period as well as transfers from loans to other real estate owned  loans declined by million from december  to december  at december   loans accounted for of earning assets  as compared to at december  the loan to deposit ratio at december  was as compared to at december  investment securities increased from million at december  to million at december  short term federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances increased from million at december  to million at december  deposits increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  in  we paid down million in callable brokered certificates of deposits 
at december   we had no brokered certificates of deposits 
due to the current economic cycle and the significant emphasis by regulators and the investment community on tangible capital  regulatory capital ratios and overall liquidity  we have attempted to control the growth of our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity throughout we have focused on growing our core deposit base while continuing to fund soundly underwritten loans 
to enhance our liquidity and improve our exposure to rising interest rates see market risk management section  the growth in deposits was invested in interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank of richmond and shorter maturity amortizing investments such as agency cmo and sba pools 
during the second quarter of  we restructured a portion of our available for sale investments 
we sold a cdo with a carrying value of million and realized a loss in the amount of million 
this security had been previously downgraded to below investment grade see note investment securities to our consolidated financial statements and did not mature until july approximately million in gse bonds and mortgage backed securities were sold that realized a gain of approximately million 
the funds received from this transaction were primarily invested in other securities that have a lower regulatory risk weighting such as gnma mortgage backed securities and sba pools 
both of these types of securities carry a zero percent regulatory risk weighting and are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
in the third and fourth quarter we sold two corporate securities  certain non taxable municipal securities and other gse securities and realized gains of thousand 
these funds from these sales were primarily reinvested in lower regulatory risk weighted assets 
a significant portion of the proceeds were reinvested into adjustable rate securities 
as a result of these transactions  we believe we have structured the balance sheet to continue to provide for improvement in our net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment  reduced the level of investments rated below investment grade  as well as improved our overall regulatory capital ratios 
during the second and third quarter of  we reclassified five private label mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of million  previously categorized in the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale category 
this transfer was made as a result of changes in circumstances that meet the accounting guidance in accordance with asc this transfer meets the guidance as outlined in section a of asc as a result of a significant deterioration in the issuer creditworthiness 
during the fourth quarter of  we reclassified all of the remaining investment securities in the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the majority of the investments in the held to maturity portfolio were non agency mortgage backed securities 
as a result of this transfer  the difference in the carrying value and fair value was recorded as an unrealized loss of 
table of contents approximately million net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 
the ratings agencies approach to downgrading these mortgage backed securities has varied significantly over the past two years and we do not believe a rating downgrade by itself is necessarily enough or the only factor to be considered to meet criteria a of the guidance 
we believe this significant deterioration is further determined by whether or not otti was recorded on the security 
these securities transferred in the second and third quarters of had incurred otti and in accordance with asc  at the time of the otti  we also recorded an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the unrealized loss on these securities is treated differently than unrealized losses on our available for sale securities for regulatory capital purposes  specifically in the way it treats the deferred tax asset on the unrealized loss 
based on the deterioration in credit quality as discussed above  we believe we have met the requirements in section a described above and did not taint the remaining held to maturity portfolio at the time of these transfers 
we made the decision to reclassify the remaining held to maturity securities to the available for sale portfolio as a result of differences in regulatory capital treatment of deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on available for sale securities versus those in the held to maturity portfolio and the potential that some of these would be transferred when or if they incurred otti 
at december   there are no securities classified as held to maturity 
we also do not consider any of our investments to have additional other than temporary impairment in excess of amounts previously recognized at december  subsequent to december   we have sold nine non agency mortgage backed securities with a total book value of million 
six of these securities with a total book value amount of approximately million were rated below investment grade by the rating agencies and the other three were rated above investment grade 
the transaction resulted in a net realized gain of approximately thousand 
since december   and including this subsequent transaction  the company portfolio of non agency mortgage backed securities has decreased from million to million and its total book value of securities rated below investment grade has decreased from million to million during this same period see note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
shareholders equity totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  as previously discussed  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of which was the reason we recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
net income available to common shareholders less dividend payments to common shareholders stock resulted in retained deficit decreasing to million as of december  earning assets loans 
loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
during  loans accounted for of average earning assets as compared to of average earning assets in the loan portfolio averaged million in as compared to million in loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  quality loan portfolio growth continues to be a strategic focus into and thereafter 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks  which we attempt to control and counterbalance 
a goal of the treasury cpp  which we participated in  was to provide funds capital to financial institutions to assist in unfreezing the credit markets 
one of our goals as a community bank has  and continues to be  to grow our assets through quality loan growth by providing credit to small and mid size businesses  as well as individuals within the markets we serve 
in  we funded new loans of approximately million 
loan production and portfolio growth rates continue to be impacted by the current economic recession  as borrowers are less inclined to leverage their corporate and personal balance sheets 
however  we remain committed to meeting the credit needs of our local markets 
a continuation of the very slow recovery from recessionary national and local 
table of contents economic conditions as well as deterioration of asset quality within our company could significantly impact our ability to grow our loan portfolio 
significant increases in regulatory capital expectations beyond the traditional well capitalized ratios and significantly increased regulatory burdens will impede our ability to leverage our balance sheet and expand the loan portfolio 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category december  in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction mortgage residential mortgage commercial consumer home equity other total gross loans allowance for loan losses total net loans in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
we follow the common practice of financial institutions in the company market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan components 
generally  we limit the loan to value ratio to 
the principal components of our loan portfolio at year end and were commercial mortgage loans in the amount of million and million  representing and of the portfolio  respectively 
significant portions of these commercial mortgage loans are made to finance owner occupied real estate 
we continue to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding our underwriting guidelines  and believe it will reduce the risk elements of the loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is a source of liquidity 
the following table sets forth the loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial and agricultural r e construction all other loan loans maturing after one year with variable rate fixed rate 
table of contents the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  as compared to million in this represents and of the average earning assets for the year ended december  and  respectively 
at december  and our investment securities portfolio amounted to million and million  respectively 
beginning in and lasting through the bond markets and many institutional holders of bonds have come under a great deal of stress partially as a result of increasing delinquencies in the sub prime mortgage lending market 
as of december   we own total mbss and cmos with an amortized cost of million and an approximate fair value of million 
these included securities with an amortized cost of million and approximate fair value of million issued by gses 
the current economic recessionary cycle has impacted mbss issued by gses  such as fhlmc and fnma 
these entities continue to experience increasing delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the mbss and cmos 
as of december  and all of the mbss issued by gses are classified as available for sale 
unrealized losses on certain of these investments are not considered to be other than temporary and we have the intent and ability to hold these until they mature or recover the current book value 
the contractual cash flows of the investments are guaranteed by the gse 
accordingly  it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than our amortized cost 
also included in our mbs and cmo portfolio are plmbss with an amortized cost of million and approximate fair value of million at december  although these are not classified as sub prime obligations or considered the high risk tranches  the majority of structured investments within all credit markets have been impacted by volatility and credit concerns and economic stresses throughout through the result has been that the market for these investments are less liquid and the spread as compared to alternative investments widened dramatically 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a leverage strategy whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
all of the mortgage assets acquired in this transaction were classified as prime or alt a securities and represented the senior or super senior tranches of the securities 
the assets acquired as part of this strategy were classified as held to maturity in the investment portfolio 
due to the significant spreads on these securities  they were all purchased at discounts 
from the inception of the leverage strategy in through december   we have realized an approximate net interest margin of on the strategy 
a detailed analysis of each of the cmo pools included in this leverage transaction as well as privately held cmos held previously in the available for sale portfolio have been analyzed by reviewing underlying loan delinquencies  collateral value and resulting credit support 
starting in early  many of these securities acquired in the leverage strategy  as well as others that were owned prior to  began to be downgraded by the various rating agencies  and at december   cusips held have been downgraded below investment grade 
we perform an internal detailed analysis on each cusip on a quarterly basis 
our internal analysis includes stressing each security using various assumptions for conditional default rate cdr  prepayment speeds cpr and severities of loss on underlying collateral once it is liquidated 
in addition  we have an independent third party perform an analysis of each security to assist with evaluating and stressing each of the securities that have been downgraded below investment grade 
our analysis to evaluate the credit loss component of the impairment includes stressing the expected cash flows using the average cpr  cdrs 
table of contents and severities over the last six months 
each cusip is reviewed and if circumstances indicate that a shorter time frame is appropriate because cdrs and severities are rapidly increasing  we will adjust these assumptions 
for the year ended december  we recognized impairment charges on six plmbs investments whereby the credit component was thousand recognized through earnings and the amount recognized through other comprehensive income amounted to million for the year ended december  see note to the financial statements 
for the year ended december  we recognized the credit impairment charges of thousand as the credit component on four plmbs securities through earnings and million through other comprehensive income 
all of these investments are held in our available for sale portfolio 
the plmbs continue to experience high levels of delinquencies in the underlying loans that make up the plmbss  and as a result we could experience additional otti in the future 
the following table summarizes the plmbss portfolio by credit rating 
the rating reflects the lowest rating by any major rating agency 
credit rating number of cusips par value amortized cost fair value aaa aa a a baa baa below investment grade total in our opinion  the current rating system does not properly reflect the overall risk in these types of multi obligor bonds 
generally  they are rated below investment grade when there is a projected loss of a level of principal based on the par value of the bond 
the process does not adequately consider what the holder paid for the bond or the impact that they are multi obligor securities 
this can cause an entire security to be rated below investment grade even though a majority of the underlying obligors are paying timely on the underlying obligation 
based on the increased trading levels and prices paid for such securities  we believe that in certain investors became more comfortable with their ability to model the cash flows underlying this type of security and began to institute strategies to acquire portfolios of plmbss 
as a result  the additional demand caused the spreads on these investments to narrow throughout and the amount of the unrealized losses on our portfolio has decreased 
we believe that the robust internal and independent external monitoring process that we have in place allows us to properly evaluate the credit risk underlying these securities and record any further otti in a timely manner 
as previously noted  subsequent to december   we sold nine non agency mortgage backed securities with a total book value of million 
six of these securities with a total book value amount of approximately million were rated below investment grade by the rating agencies and the other three were rated above investment grade 
the transaction resulted in a net realized gain in the first quarter of of approximately thousand 
since december   and including these subsequent first quarter transactions  the company portfolio of non agency mortgage backed securities has decreased from million to million and the total book value of securities rated below investment grade has decreased from million to million during this same period 
the decrease was accomplished through the sales noted above as well as normal principal paydowns and to a lesser extent the otti charges discussed above 
the result of selling these securities will have a negative impact on the overall yield on the investment portfolio but  while not eliminating  significantly reduces the overall risk and exposure to additional otti in the event the underlying collateral performance of these securities deteriorates in the future 

table of contents we also hold corporate bonds and other securities with an amortized cost value of million and fair value of million as of december  the unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to bonds with four different issuers 
all of these bonds are carried in the available for sale portfolio 
the economic conditions throughout and have had a significant impact on all corporate debt obligations 
as a result  the spreads on all of these securities have widened dramatically and the liquidity of many of these investments has been negatively impacted 
each of these bonds is rated bbb investment grade or better s p with the exception of two bonds downgraded during the last months 
one downgraded investment is rated cc by fitch and ca by moody and is a preferred term security with a book value of thousand and fair value of thousand 
this bond has a par value of million and during we recognized otti in the amount of million through earnings credit component and thousand through other comprehensive income 
the fourth bond is rated bbb by s p and ba by moody with a carrying value of thousand and a fair value of thousand 
all of the corporate bonds held by the company are reviewed on a quarterly basis to identify downgrades by rating agencies as well as deterioration of the underlying collateral or in the issuer ability to service the debt obligation 
for corporate debt securities  we review the underlying issuer credit quality  additional underlying credit support  and the length of maturity of the bond 
if our analysis determines that it is likely we will recover all of the projected cash flows  we do not deem the security to be otti

on april   the bank entered into the formal agreement with the occ  our primary bank regulator 
the formal agreement is based on the findings of the occ during a on site examination of the bank 
as reflected in the formal agreement  the occ primary concern with the bank is driven by the rating agencies downgrades of non agency mbs in its investment portfolio 
these securities  purchased in through  were all rated aaa by the rating agencies at the time of purchase  however  they have been impacted by the economic recession and the stress on the residential housing sector see discussion above under investments and note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the formal agreement did not require any adjustment to the bank balance sheet or income statement  nor did it change the bank well capitalized status 
in addition to the formal agreement  the occ has separately established the following individual minimum capital ratios for the bank a tier leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   the bank exceeds these ratios 
the board of directors has appointed an independent compliance committee made up of directors to monitor and report on compliance with the terms of the formal agreement

there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to comply fully with the provisions of the formal agreement  and the determination of our compliance will be made by the occ 
however  management believes the bank is currently in compliance with all provisions of the formal agreement 
failure to meet the requirements of the formal agreement could result in additional regulatory requirements  which could result in regulators taking additional enforcement actions against the bank

the ability of the company to pay cash dividends is dependent upon receiving cash in the form of dividends from the bank 
the dividends that may be paid by the bank to the company are subject to legal limitations and regulatory capital requirements 
in addition to the formal agreement  the approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any 
table of contents calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus 
further  the company cannot pay cash dividends on its common stock during any calendar quarter unless full dividends on the series t preferred stock for the dividend period ending during the calendar quarter have been declared and the company has not failed to pay a dividend in the full amount of the series t preferred stock with respect to the period in which such dividend payment in respect of its common stock would occur 
however  restrictions currently exist  including within the formal agreement  that prohibit the bank from paying cash dividends to the company 
in addition  the company must currently obtain preapproval of the federal reserve board before paying dividends

liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet 
table of contents components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally the ability to generate customer deposits in our market area 
in addition  liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against approved lines of credit federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time 
these advances are secured by securities pledged by the bank or assignment of loans within the bank portfolio 
with the successful completion of the common stock offering in  the secondary offering completed in  the trust preferred offering completed in september  the acquisition of dutchfork in october  the acquisition of dekalb in june and the preferred stock offering under the cpp program in november we have maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital along with retained earnings less the and net loss  sufficient to fund the operations of the bank for at least the next months 
we anticipate that the bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next months 
the loss related to goodwill impairment in was a noncash charge and had no impact on regulatory capital or tangible equity 
total shareholders equity was of total assets at december  and at december  funds sold and short term interest bearing deposits are our primary source of liquidity and averaged million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the bank maintains federal funds purchased lines  in the amount of million each with two financial institutions  although these were not utilized in the fhlb atlanta has approved a line of credit of up to of the bank assets  which would be collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities and or eligible loans 
we regularly review the liquidity position of the company and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non core sources 
we believe that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully 
we believe our liquidity remains adequate to meet operating and loan funding requirements and that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term and short term liquidity needs successfully 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with gaap  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
please refer to note of the company financial statements for a discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and the bank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and 
table of contents change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we continually seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
