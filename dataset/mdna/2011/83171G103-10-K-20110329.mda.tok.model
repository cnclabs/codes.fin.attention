item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of see forward looking statements following the table of contents of this k 
because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we measure our operations using both financial and other metrics 
the financial metrics include revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and income from continuing operations 
other key metrics include i revenues by sales source  ii online sales  iii cash flows and iv ebitda 
some of the most significant trends affecting our business are the following the increasing recognition by professionals and corporations that they must continually improve their skills and those of their employees in order to remain competitive  continuing and expanding professional education requirements by governing bodies  including states and professional associations  the plethora of new laws and regulations affecting the conduct of business and the relationship between employers and their employees  the increased competition in today s economy for skilled employees and the recognition that effective training can be used to recruit and train employees  the development and acceptance of the internet as a delivery channel for the types of products and services we offer  and current economic conditions 
over the last five years  our annual revenues have grown by approximately percent from million in to million this year 
this growth is due in large part to the acquisitions that we have completed in this period 
we intend to continue focusing on acquisitions that will allow us to increase the breadth and depth of our current product offerings  including the general corporate market for compliance  governance and ethics 
we will also consider acquisitions that will give us access to new markets and products 
we prefer acquisitions that are accretive  as opposed to those that are dilutive  but ultimately the decision will be based on maximizing shareholder value rather than short term profits 
the size of the acquisitions will be determined  in part  by our size  the capital available to us and the liquidity and price of our stock 
we may use debt to enhance or augment our ability to consummate larger transactions 
there are many risks involved with acquisitions  some of which are discussed in item of part of this report under the caption certain risk factors that may affect our growth and profitability 
these risks include identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  successfully negotiating the business  legal and financial terms of the acquisitions  integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and corporate structure  retaining key employees and minimizing disruptions to our existing business 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or negotiate reasonable terms or that any acquired business or assets will deliver the shareholder value that we anticipated at the outset 
with respect to our performance for the recently completed fiscal year  the downturn in the economy affected us as well  resulting in decreased revenues and an operating loss 
while we reduced our operating costs wherever possible  including headcount  we were unable to increase prices 
we also experienced a dramatic decrease in custom work and decreased attendance in our live seminar business 
our core subscription based business was able to remain relatively flat and we saw a small increase in revenues from our financial services division 
all our other divisions and subsidiaries experienced a reduction in revenue for various reasons 
overall  revenue from our accounting finance division increased  primarily attributable to our eei division  which had its first full year of operations 
as the overall business environment improves  we expect to recognize an increase in revenues from our major business units 
on the expense side  eei was a significant factor in the increase of operating expenses  as we absorbed a full year of its overhead costs  offset by reductions in staff and overhead from other divisions 
we have reduced our overhead costs and continually monitor our direct and general and administrative costs and make the necessary adjustments where warranted 
we are also constantly looking for new avenues for our existing products and we continue to expend a significant amount of money to upgrade our library  create new products and develop new technology 
seasonality and cyclicality historically  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter  primarily because a portion of our business is non subscription based 
custom jobs and consulting work are subject to both the general business climate and client s needs 
our engineering revenue is subject to staffing levels in both the private and public sector and the timing of various licensing exams 
in economic downturns  staff reductions result in fewer people taking professional engineering licensing exams 
our subscription based revenue is spread over the life of the subscription which is generally one year and can be effected by staff reductions as well 
with our acquisition of loscalzo and eei  these quarterly fluctuations have become more evident and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
both loscalzo and eei generate most of their revenue from live training programs 
in eei s case  the revenue is recognized almost exclusively in the second and fourth quarters  when the sessions take place 
in loscalzo s case  the revenue tends to be recognized over the second  third and fourth quarters  with the fourth quarter revenue being the greatest 
while the costs that are directly related to the production of this revenue are expensed over the same period  both loscalzo and eei have general and administrative expenses that are incurred ratably over the year  creating the fluctuations in our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
revenues a large portion of our revenues is in the form of subscription fees for any of our monthly accounting update programs or access to our library of accounting  financial services training and legal courses 
other sources of revenue include direct sales of programs or courses on a non subscription basis or from various forms of live training  fees for website design  software development  video production  course design and development  ongoing maintenance of the pec  and licensing fees 
subscriptions are billed on an annual basis  payable in advance and deferred at the time of billing 
sales made over the internet are by credit card only 
renewals are usually sent out days before the subscription period ends 
larger transactions are usually dealt with by contract  the financial terms of which depend on the services being provided 
revenues from subscription services are recognized as earned  deferred at the time of billing or payment and amortized into revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription 
engineering products are non subscription based and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product or  in the case of online sales  payment 
revenues from live training are recognized when earned  usually upon the completion of the seminar or conference 
revenues from non subscription services provided to customers  such as website design  video production  consulting services and custom projects are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis where sufficient information relating to project status and other supporting documentation is available 
the contracts may have different billing arrangements resulting in either unbilled or deferred revenue 
we obtain either a signed agreement or purchase order from our non subscription customers outlining the terms and conditions of the sale or service to be provided 
otherwise  these services are recognized as revenues after completion and delivery to the customer 
duplication and related services are generally recognized upon shipment or  if later  when our obligations are complete and realization of receivable amounts is assured 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived tangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year and or whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered or are impaired 
goodwill is evaluated by comparing the value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable company s data 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
any impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the evaluation of the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset against estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with it 
impairment may be caused by a number of factors  including a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires the company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
upon completing our review and testing for the current period we believe that we have not incurred any impairment to such assets 
stock based compensation compensation costs are recognized in the financial statements for stock options or grants awarded to employees and directors 
options and warrants granted to non employees are recorded as an expense at the date of grant based on the then estimated fair value of the security granted 
segment reporting all of our operations constitute a single segment  that of educational services 
revenues from non educational services  such as video production are not a material part of our operating income 
income taxes we account for deferred tax assets available principally from our fixed and intangible assets and our net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with the accounting standards codification 
we make significant estimates and assumptions in calculating our current period income tax liability and deferred tax assets 
the most significant of these are estimates regarding future period earnings 
our net deferred tax asset is estimated by management using a five year taxable income projection 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and the following table compares our statement of operations data for the years ended december   and the trends suggested by this table may not be indicative of future operating results  which will depend on various factors including the relative mix of products sold accounting finance  engineering or corporate training and the method of sale video or online 
year ended december amount percentage amount percentage change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating loss income other income  net loss income before provision for income taxes income tax provision net loss income net revenues net revenues for decreased percent  compared to net revenues for  primarily as a result of the decrease in custom work from skye and decreases in other product lines 
our live training businesses now represent approximately percent of our net revenues 
revenues from online sales of subscription based products and other related sales accounted for approximately million  or percent  of our revenues 
net revenues from sales of our accounting finance products grew in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  primarily as a result of a full year of operations by eei 
in  net revenues from our accounting finance and related products were million  compared to million in in each of and net revenues from accounting finance products including both subscription and non subscription based revenue was million 
net revenues from live training  custom work and advertising were million in  as compared to million in the difference is primarily attributable to eei 
net revenues from sales of our engineering products  which are not subscription based  were  in  compared to  in the decrease in engineering sales is due to the general economic climate as there are less exam candidates 
however  this is not indicative of any long term trends  as we are seeing renewed interest in some of our course material 
net revenues from video production  duplication and consulting services decreased in to  from  in  as a result of decreased consulting work and a reduction in video work as well 
video production and duplication income fluctuates annually  but overall they continue to decline 
the duplication business has declined because tape is no longer used and we do not have the capability of doing very large dvd duplication projects 
our video production facility is primarily used for internal work and income results from the renting of our facilities and or our equipment 
consulting work varies from year to year and sales are credited to the department from which they originate and not to the department where the work is performed 
net revenues from sle decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  from our cognistar legal division  and a decrease of  from our ethics division 
the decrease in cognistar sales is due to the economy as many law firms have reduced staff and cut budgets 
the ethics division s income is from custom consulting jobs and economic conditions have curtailed spending in that area as well 
skye generated million of net revenues in  compared to million in skye produces customized training and educational material for the pharmaceutical industry  professional firms  financial services companies and others 
it took skye a much longer time to feel the effects of the economic downturn as it completed projects in early that began in many companies have cut back on custom work or are assessing alternatives methods of production in an effort to reduce their costs 
our financial services training division generated net revenues of million in  compared to only million in the largest portion of the growth comes from financialcampus course sales  which are delivered over the internet 
our technology training division  watchit  generated net revenues of  in  compared to  of revenues in  due to a decrease in custom projects 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes i production costs  such as the salaries  benefits and other costs related to personnel  whether our employees or independent contractors  who are used directly in connection with producing or conducting our educational programs  ii royalties paid to third parties  iii the cost of materials  such as dvds  printed matter and packaging materials and iv shipping costs 
compared to  cost of revenues in decreased by approximately million 
this decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue from skye  who employs a large amount of outsourced labor in completing their projects 
cost of revenues in decreased to percent from percent in  resulting in a percent increase in our gross profit margin 
with the addition of loscalzo and eei  which together represent approximately percent of our current net revenues  we anticipate a lower gross profit percentage as these businesses are more labor and cost intensive than our subscription based products 
there are many different types of expenses that are characterized as production costs and they vary from period to period depending on many factors 
the expenses that showed the greatest variations from to and the reasons for those variations are as follows outside labor and direct production costs 
outside labor includes the cost of hiring actors and production personnel such as directors  producers and cameramen and the outsourcing of non video technology 
it also includes the costs of instructors for live training and the production of those courses 
these costs decreased by approximately million in from both skye and our consulting technology departments employ a number of consultants to write scripts  edit course material and provide technology services 
loscalzo and eei employ a number of consultants to develop course material  in addition to hiring instructors to deliver programs throughout the united states 
we have been outsourcing some of the programming and content development functions that were previously done by our employees to firms in india and china at a substantial savings 
direct production costs  which are costs related to producing videos other than labor costs such as the cost of renting equipment and locations  and the purchase of materials decreased by  these variations are related to the type of video production and custom projects and do not reflect any trends in our business 
salaries 
overall payroll and related costs attributable to production personnel decreased by approximately  the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in head count in our skye and sle subsidiaries  as well as reductions in some of our other divisions  offset by a full year of related costs from our eei acquisition 
our sle and skye salaries and related costs decreased by  this was offset by increased salaries from eei of approximately  reduction in salaries and related costs from our loscalzo subsidiary accounted for approximately  in savings and our financialcampus division accounted for an additional  in savings  offset by an increase of  in our technology division 
royalties 
royalty expense increased in  as compared to  by approximately  royalty expense is directly related to sales of certain products in our accounting and engineering catalogs  and as usage fluctuates so does our royalty expense 
this increase was due to increased royalties in accounting education from one of our partners  offset by a decrease in royalties related to our engineering products 
we often have to estimate the royalty expense due our partners  as the information may not be available 
if volume increases or if we enter into new agreements or modify existing agreements  the actual royalty payments in under these agreements may be either higher or lower than they were in other costs 
this includes the cost of venues for our live training business  travel for instructors and others  shipping costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
these other costs increased by  primarily related to eei s live training business 
the largest component of these expenses are venue  travel and course administration costs that increased by  in from the remaining increase was from increased shipping costs of  related to shipping instructional materials to the various venues  a substantial portion of which are charged to the clients 
travel costs incurred by skye and loscalzo are often billed to their respective clients 
as our business grows we may be required to hire additional production personnel  increasing our cost of revenues 
selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include corporate overhead such as i compensation and benefits for administrative  sales and marketing and finance personnel  ii rent  iii insurance  iv professional fees  v travel and entertainment and vi office expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased from by  but as a percentage of net revenue it increased percent 
the decrease in terms of actual expenses is primarily from reductions in payroll and related costs as headcounts have been reduced 
reductions in compensation expense totaled  after recognizing a full year of eei compensation expenses 
overhead expenses for advertising  promotional material and other selling expenses increased by approximately  this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of such costs for eei 
exclusive of these increases  other overhead expenses increased approximately  primarily due to increases in our communication costs  the general increase in use of credit cards for payments and other miscellaneous costs 
in addition  in conformity with applicable accounting standards  we are expensing the costs associated with the grants of options and restricted stock to employees and directors 
this non cash expense in was  and  in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain constant in as we have now fully absorbed the eei acquisition with its substantial marketing expenses and our costs remain constant 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were  higher in than they were in the increase is attributable to intangible assets acquired in the loscalzo and eei transactions  as well as from the capitalization of intangible assets developed internally principally our new pec  known as ecampus 
the total cost of the intangible assets acquired in the loscalzo and eei transaction  exclusive of goodwill  was approximately  which is being amortized over various periods ranging from three to years 
the total capitalized cost of ecampus is  and is being amortized over five years 
as we are always upgrading our computer hardware and systems  and because we have a number of projects in development  we expect our depreciation and amortization expenses on our fixed and intangible assets to increase 
operating loss income for  our operating loss was  compared to an operating profit of  in the decrease in net revenues from our skye subsidiary and our legal and ethics division are the primary reasons for the decrease in operating income 
other income  net other income and expense items primarily consist of interest earned on deposits  offset by the loss from our joint venture in ireflect  llc 
we currently have no outstanding debt  other than normal trade payables 
net interest income increased by  due to the collection of interest from a note receivable that was repaid during the year 
we do not anticipate an increase in interest income as interest rates continue to remain very low in and in addition  our joint venture in ireflect resulted in a loss of  in  compared to a loss of  in income tax expense in  we recorded a net tax expense of  compared to a  expense in we have analyzed all of the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and have recorded a net benefit of million after taking a valuation allowance of approximately  as compared to a net deferred tax asset of million in the prior year 
the tax expense consists of net federal income tax benefit of  offset by state and local income tax expense of approximately  in the prior year we recorded a net tax expense of  after recording a net federal tax benefit of  offset by state and local income tax expense of approximately  net loss income for  we recorded a net loss of  compared to a net income of  for the decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit and higher depreciation and amortization expenses offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our working capital requirements through internally generated funds  sales of equity and debt securities and proceeds from short term bank borrowings 
at year end  we had no indebtedness for borrowed money 
our working capital as of december   was approximately million compared to a million working capital as of december  the decrease is attributable to a number of factors including the payment of approximately  in dividends  and the repurchase of our common stock for approximately  our current ratio at december   is to  compared to to at december  the current ratio is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities and is a measure used by lending sources to assess our ability to repay short term liabilities 
the largest component of our current liabilities  approximately million and million at december   and respectively  is deferred revenue  which is revenue collected or billed but not yet earned under the principles of revenue recognition 
most of this revenue is in the form of subscription fees and will be earned over the next months 
the cost of fulfilling our monthly subscription obligation does not exceed this revenue and is booked to expense as incurred 
for some of our products  there are no additional costs  other than shipping costs  required to complete this obligation as the material is already in our library 
for the year ended december   we had a net increase in cash of  we generated million in cash from operations  offset by  used in investing activities including  for asset acquisitions and  for the capitalization of software and courses 
in addition  we expended  for the purchase of treasury shares and  for the payment of dividends 
the primary components of our operating cash flows are our net income adjusted for non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  and the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred revenues 
in comparison  for the year ended december   we had a  increase in cash 
that increase was a result of cash generated by operations of million  offset by cash expended for investing activities of million primarily for acquisitions of million and  for various asset acquisitions or internal capitalization of intangibles 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   were approximately  of which  consisted primarily of telecommunication equipment  computer equipment and software  most of which was for our off site hosting facility  a requirement of sox compliance 
we capitalized  of costs for the production of various courses and  for capitalizing the costs of ecampus and other products 
we are constantly reviewing and upgrading our technology 
for fiscal  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures other than software and course development costs in march  our board of directors declared a dividend of 
per common share payable on april   to shareholders of record on march  contractual obligation  commitments and contingencies as of december   we had commitments under various leases for our offices in hawthorne  new york  the sle office in westborough  massachusetts  skye s offices in bridgewater  new jersey  and loscalzo s office in red bank  new jersey 
the total aggregate commitment under these leases is approximately million through january sle recently entered into a new lease that expires in january and calls for a monthly rent of approximately  the skye lease was recently extended to january at a monthly rental of  and the lease for the loscalzo office expires on june   at a monthly rent of  in the future  we may issue additional debt or equity securities to satisfy our cash needs 
any debt incurred or issued may be secured or unsecured  at a fixed or variable interest rate and may contain other terms and conditions that our board of directors deems prudent 
any sales of equity securities may be at or below current market prices 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in generating sufficient capital to adequately fund our liquidity needs 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities or money market funds  we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
credit risk most of our cash is held in deposit accounts  us treasury and non treasury money market funds 
our bank deposit accounts are insured by the us government but only up to a maximum of  at any one bank 
our money market funds are held in a brokerage account that is insured by the security industry protection corp up to  and various brokerage firms may carry additional insurance from commercial insurance companies 
our cash balances vary from time to time based on a variety of factors but in most cases are significantly in excess of the insurable limit 
as a result  we have exposure on these accounts in the event these financial institutions become insolvent 
in addition  we may have credit risk with respect to customers who default on custom orders or who default on subscription payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to topic  which provides further guidance on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative basis 
this amendment affect all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
this amendment is effective for years ending after december  the implementation of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb also issued an amendment to topic  business combinations 
the amendment describes the requirements for issuing pro forma information related to business combinations that occurred in the current accounting period 
this amendment is effective for periods ending after december  we believe that this amendment has no current impact on our consolidated financial statements as no acquisitions were made in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a smaller reporting company  as defined by regulation s k  and  as such  are not providing the information contained in this item pursuant to regulation s k
