supplemental information unaudited the following estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  both developed and undeveloped  represent interests owned by the company located solely in the united states 
disclosures of oil and gas reserves  which follow  are based on estimates prepared by independent petroleum engineers for the years ended december    and such analyses are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
these estimates do not include probable or possible reserves 
these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission sec 
because of unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts  crude oil and natural gas price changes  largely influenced and controlled by us and foreign government actions  and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary significantly  management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited 
estimates of future net cash flows presented do not represent management assessment of future profitability or future cash flows to the company 
management investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves as well as probable reserves  and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here 
it should be recognized that applying current costs and prices and a ten percent standard discount rate does not convey fair market value 
the discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of the value of proved reserves

our estimated proved developed and undeveloped gas reserves were decreased by  primarily due to the unsuccessful effort to restore production from hanson b in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil reserves were revised upward by  as a result of improved pricing and performance at our edison  belridge  and pleasant valley leases 
c in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped gas reserves were decreased by  mcf due to evaluations at our hanson lease 
d in december  the average oil price for properties we operated was  which was lower than the previous year evaluation average oil price of a decrease of 
due to the dramatic drop in oil prices  all producing properties in which tri valley held interests at year end were operating at uneconomic levels when assessed applying the parameters prescribed by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
as a result  at year end  oil reserves were reduced by  barrels  to zero  a decrease 
e in  completion of wells in the moffat ranch field and extended production of the martins severin and webb tract wells increased reserves by  mcf 
f in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil reserves were decreased by  bbls due to the sale of our belridge and edison properties

gas reserve estimates of mcf for one small  non operated lease were reduced to zero 
supplemental information unaudited continued standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is presented below for the years ended december    and the future net cash inflows are developed as follows estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year end economic conditions 
the estimated future production of proved reserves is priced on the basis of year end prices 
the resulting future gross revenue streams are reduced by estimated future costs to develop and to produce proved reserves  based on year end cost estimates 
the resulting future net revenue streams are reduced to present value amounts by applying a ten percent discount 
disclosure of principal components of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows provides information concerning the factors involved in making the calculation 
in addition  the disclosure of both undiscounted and discounted net cash flows provides a measure of comparing proved oil and gas reserves both with and without an estimate of production timing 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves reflects income taxes 
december  december  december  future cash in flows future production costs future development costs future income tax expenses future net cash flows annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow refer to the following table for analysis in changes in standardized measure 
changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve quantities this statement discloses the sources of changes in the standardized measure from year to year 
the amounts reported as net changes in prices and changes in production costs represent the present values of changes in prices and production costs multiplied by estimates of proved reserves as of the beginning of the year 
the accretion of discount was computed by multiplying the ten percent discount factor by the standardized measure as of the beginning of the year 
the sales of oil and gas produced  net of production costs is expressed in actual dollar amounts 
revisions of previous quantity estimates is expressed at year end prices 
the net change in income taxes is computed as the change in present value of future income taxes

controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls the company conducted an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of rules a e and d e as of december  based upon that evaluation  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective as of december   as discussed in management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
limitations on the effectiveness of controls our management  including our chief executive and chief financial officers  does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  but not absolute  assurance that the objectives of a control system are met 
further  any control system reflects limitations on resources  and the benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within tri valley corporation have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of a control 
a design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected
