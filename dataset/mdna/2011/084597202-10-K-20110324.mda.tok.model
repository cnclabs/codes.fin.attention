item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of berkshire bancorp inc and subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended december  and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes notes located in item herein 
reference is also made to part i  item business herein 
segments management has determined that the company through its wholly owned bank subsidiary  the bank  operates in one business segment  community banking 
the bank principal business activity consists of gathering deposits from the general public and investing those deposits in residential and commercial mortgage loans and commercial non mortgage loans  both unsecured and secured by personal property 
in addition  the bank invests those deposits in debt obligations issued by the us government  its agencies  business corporations and mortgage backed securities 
series a preferred shares on october   the company sold an aggregate of  series a preferred shares at  per share  or million in the aggregate  to the company chairman of the board and majority stockholder  and two non affiliated investors 
each series a preferred share bears non cumulative cash dividends at the rate of per annum  payable quarterly  is mandatorily convertible into shares of our common stock on october  and was redeemable at the option of the company between april  and november  at a redemption price of  no series a preferred shares were redeemed during the redemption period 
so long as any share of series a preferred shares remains outstanding  unless the full dividends for the most recent dividend payment date have been paid or declared  no dividends may be paid or declared on the company common stock 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of series a preferred shares 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than any of its other significant accounting estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see further discussion of the allowance for loan losses in provision for loan losses 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether charges to the recorded balances are necessary 
the company tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at the bank  the reporting unit 
a fair value is determined based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceed the book value  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company books to write down the related goodwill to the carrying value 
as of december   the goodwill was evaluated for impairment and the company determined that the recognition of impairment totalling million was necessary 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
the company evaluates unrealized losses on securities to determine if any reduction in the fair value is other than temporary 
this amount will continue to be dependent on market conditions  the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances of the issuer of the security  and the company intent and ability to hold impaired investments at the time the valuation is made 
if management determines that an impairment in the investment value is other than temporary  earnings would be charged 
the company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of its assets and liabilities considered to be financial instruments 
for the company  as for most financial institutions  the majority of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments 
the company values those financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement

net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
average balances for berkshire bancorp inc parent only have been calculated on a monthly basis 
changes in net interest income may be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense

the allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses that is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates which involve a high degree of judgment  subjectivity of the assumptions utilized  and potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with us gaap  principally fasb asc  contingencies  asc and fasb asc  receivables  asc 
under the above accounting principles  we are required to maintain an allowance for probable losses at the balance sheet date 
we are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
management performs a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are made for loans determined to be impaired 
impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or  as a practical expedient for collateral dependent loans  the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses 
the bank considers its investment in one to four family real estate loans and consumer loans to be smaller balance homogeneous loans and therefore excluded from separate identification for evaluation of impairment 
these homogeneous loan groups are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis under asc the general reserve is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
management also analyzes historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions  geographic concentrations  and industry and peer comparisons 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan segments to determine the amount of the general reserves 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses management has established which could have a material negative effect on the company financial results 
on a monthly basis  the bank management committee reviews the current status of various loan assets in order to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this evaluation process  specific loans are analyzed to determine their potential risk of loss 
this process includes all loans  concentrating on non accrual and classified loans 
each non accrual or classified loan is evaluated for potential loss exposure 
any shortfall results in a recommendation of a specific allowance if the likelihood of loss is evaluated as probable 
to determine the adequacy of collateral on a particular loan  an estimate of the fair market value of the collateral is based on the most current appraised value available 
this appraised value is then reduced to reflect estimated liquidation expenses 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisal valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio  management believes the primary risks are increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  generally  and a decline in real estate market values in the new york metropolitan area 
any one or combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses reflects the inherent credit risk in our portfolio  the level of our non performing loans and our charge off experience 
a loan is considered nonperforming when it becomes delinquent ninety days or when other adverse factors become known to us 
we generally order updated appraisals from independent third party licensed appraisers at the time the loan is identified as nonperforming 
depending upon the property type  we receive appraisals within thirty to ninety days from the date the appraisals are ordered 
upon receipt of the appraisal  which is discounted by us to take account of estimated selling and other holding costs  we compare the adjusted appraisal amount to the carrying amount of the real estate dependent loan and record any impairment through the allowance for loan loss at that time 
the majority of our real estate dependent loans are concentrated in the new york city metropolitan area  we do not make adjustments to the appraisals for this concentration 
we do not increase the appraised value of any property 
any adjustments we make to the appraisals are to decrease the appraised value due to selling and other holding costs 
although management believes that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses what it believes is the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation  new york state banking department  and other regulatory bodies  as an integral part of their examination process  will periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net loss allocated to common stockholders 
net loss allocated to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended december  was million  or per common share  as compared to million  or per common share  for the fiscal year ended december  the net loss allocated to common stockholders was primarily due to the write off of goodwill of million  or per common share  the other than temporary impairment otti charges on securities of million  or per common share  the loss on the termination of our pension plan of million  or per common share and dividends on our series a preferred stock of million  or per common share  partially offset by the benefit for income taxes of million  or per common share 
the net loss allocated to common stockholders in fiscal was primarily due to otti charges on securities of million  or per common share  and dividends on our series a preferred stock of million  or per common share  partially offset by the benefit for income taxes of million  or  per common share 
the otti charge was due to our investment  directly and indirectly through auction rate securities  in preferred shares of fannie mae and freddie mac 
these government sponsored agencies were placed into conservatorship by the federal government in september resulting in  among other things  the suspension of dividend payments 
in january  the bank filed an arbitration proceeding with the financial industry regulatory authority against the issuing financial institution of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
the outcome of the arbitration process  scheduled for july of  and the amount we may recover  if any  is uncertain at this time 
the company net income is largely dependent on interest rate levels  the demand for the company loan and deposit products and the strategies employed to manage the interest rate and other risks inherent in the banking business 
interest income 
total interest income for the fiscal year ended december  decreased by million to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in total interest income in fiscal was primarily due to the million decrease in the average amount of interest earning assets to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and the decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the following table presents the composition of interest income for the indicated periods fiscal fiscal interest income of total interest income of total in thousands  except percentages loans investment securities other total interest income loans  which are inherently risky and therefore command a higher return than our portfolio of investment securities and other interest earning assets  decreased to of total average interest earning assets during fiscal from of total interest earning assets during fiscal the average amounts of investment securities increased to of total average interest earning assets during fiscal from of total interest earning assets during fiscal while we actively seek to originate new loans with qualified borrowers who meet the bank underwriting standards  our strategy has been to maintain those standards  sacrificing some current income to avoid possible large future losses in the loan portfolio 
at december   our portfolio of investment securities included approximately million at cost of auction rate securities and approximately million at cost of corporate notes  including single issuer and pooled trust preferred securities 
the fair value of these securities  presently million and million  respectively  could be negatively impacted in the future 
were this to occur  we may be required to reflect a write down of certain of our securities in future periods as a charge to earnings if any of these securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
such impairment charge could be material to our results of operations 
as required by fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities  securities are classified into three categories trading  held to maturity and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account activities in the statement of income 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company does not have a trading securities portfolio and has no current plans to maintain such a portfolio in the future 
the company generally classifies all newly purchased debt securities as available for sale in order to maintain the flexibility to sell those securities if the need arises 
the bank has a limited portfolio of securities classified as held to maturity  represented principally by securities purchased a number of years ago 
federal home loan bank stock 
the bank owns stock of the fhlbny which is necessary for it to be a member of the fhlbny 
membership requires the purchase of stock equal to of the bank mortgage related assets investments and loans plus of the outstanding borrowings 
the stock is redeemable at par 
therefore  its cost is equivalent to its redemption value 
the bank ability to redeem fhlbny shares is dependent upon the redemption practices of the fhlbny 
at december   the fhlbny neither placed restrictions on redemption of shares in excess of a member required investment in stock  nor stated that it will cease paying dividends 
the bank did not consider this asset impaired at either december  or the following table presents the composition of average interest earning assets for the indicated periods fiscal fiscal average amount of total average amount of total in thousands  except percentages loans investment securities other total interest earning assets interest expense 
total interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  decreased by million to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in total interest expense was due to the million decrease in the average amounts of interest bearing liabilities to million during fiscal from million during fiscal and the decrease in the average rates paid on such liabilities to from during fiscal years and  respectively 
the following table presents the composition of interest expense for the indicated periods fiscal fiscal interest expense of total interest expense of total in thousands  except percentages interest bearing deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest expense the following table presents the composition of average interest bearing liabilities for the indicated periods fiscal fiscal average amount of total average amount of total in thousands  except percentages interest bearing deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest income 
the company primary source of revenue is net interest income  or the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including i the amount of interest earning assets that the company can maintain based upon its funding sources  ii the relative amounts of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  and iii the difference between the yields earned on those assets and the rates paid on those liabilities 
non performing loans adversely affect net interest income because they must still be funded by interest bearing liabilities  but they do not provide interest income 
furthermore  when we designate an asset as non performing  all interest which has been accrued but not actually received is deducted from current period income  further reducing net interest income 
for the fiscal year ended december   net interest income increased by approximately  to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in net interest income in fiscal was due to the decrease in the average amount of interest bearing liabilities  the decrease in interest expense and the decrease in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as discussed above 
the company interest rate spread  the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  increased by basis points to during fiscal from during fiscal net interest margin 
net interest margin  or net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets  increased by basis points to during fiscal from during fiscal we seek to secure and retain customer deposits with competitive products and rates  while making strategic use of the prevailing interest rate environment to borrow funds at what we believe to be attractive rates 
we invest such deposits and borrowed funds in what we believe to be a prudent mix of fixed and adjustable rate loans  investment securities and short term interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest margin during fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense 
non interest income 
non interest income consists primarily of realized gains on sales of marketable securities and service fee income 
for the fiscal year ended december   total non interest income increased by million to million from  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was due to the million gain on the sales of marketable securities in fiscal compared to a loss of  on such sales during fiscal the following table presents the composition of non interest income for the indicated periods fiscal fiscal non interest income of total non interest income of total in thousands  except percentages service charges on deposits investment securities gains losses other total non interest income non interest expense 
non interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  legal and professional fees  other operating expenses associated with the day to day operations of the company and otti charges on investment securities 
total non interest expense for the fiscal years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  including otti charges on investment securities of million and million  respectively 
excluding the otti charges  the one time charge of million resulting from the termination of our pension plan and the charge of million for the write off of goodwill in fiscal  total non interest expense during fiscal increased by  to million from million during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined to close its bank branch in ridgefield  nj 
based upon an appraisal of the property  we recorded an impairment charge of  at december   included in other non interest expense 
the increase in other expense during fiscal was also due to a fraud perpetrated on the company by unknown persons resulting in a loss to the company of the following table presents the composition of non interest expense for the indicated periods

for the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of million compared to a benefit for income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended december  the tax benefit in fiscal relates to the loss before provision for income taxes and the decrease in the valuation allowance  offset by significant permanent item add backs mainly related to the goodwill write off 
the tax benefit in fiscal includes the benefit from the actual losses realized on sales of investment securities 
investment activities general 
the investment policy of the bank is designed primarily to provide satisfactory yields while maintaining adequate liquidity  a balance of high quality  diversified investments  and minimal risk 
the bank does not  as a rule  invest in equity securities 
however  the company does invest in some equity securities 
the largest component of the bank investments  representing more than of total investment securities  are debt securities issued by us government agencies including freddie mac  fannie mae or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
the remainder of the bank debt securities investments are primarily short term debt securities issued by the united states or its agencies 
the bank maintains a portfolio of high yield corporate debt securities 
recognizing the higher credit risks of these securities  the bank underwrites these securities in a manner similar to its loan underwriting procedures 
the following is a summary of held to maturity investment securities december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands us government agencies december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands us government agencies the following is a summary of available for sale investment securities december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands us treasury notes us government agencies mortgage backed securities corporate notes single issuer trust preferred cdo pooled trust preferred cdo municipal securities auction rate securities marketable equity securities and other totals december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands us treasury notes us government agencies mortgage backed securities corporate notes single issuer trust preferred cdo pooled trust preferred cdo municipal securities auction rate securities marketable equity securities and other totals management uses a multi factor approach to determine whether each investment security in an unrealized loss position is other than temporarily impaired otti 
an unrealized loss position exists when the current fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost basis 
the valuation factors utilized by management incorporate the ideas and concepts outlined in relevant accounting guidance 
these include such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition of the issuer of the security as well as the near and long term prospect for the issuer  the rating of the security by a national rating agency  historical volatility and movement in the fair market value of the security  and adverse conditions relative to the security  issuer or industry 
the following table shows the outstanding auction rate securities at december  and amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value in thousands federal home loan mortgage corporation preferred shares preferred shares of money center banks public utility debt and equity securities totals the fair value of the auction rate securities is determined by management using a discounted cash flow analysis and by valuing the underlying security 
the auction rate securities allow for conversion to the underlying preferred security after two failed auctions 
as of december   there have been more than two failed auctions for all outstanding auction rate securities 
because of the lack of liquidity in the market for the auction rate securities as compared to the market for the underlying preferred shares and as there is a possibility of an orderly transaction and market for the underlying preferred shares without significant adjustment to their carrying value  we considered the market value of the underlying preferred shares to be more objective and relevant 
for the public utility debt and equity securities  the security is collateralized by a mutual fund in which the majority of the investments are public utility debt and equity securities 
as this fund  as well as other mutual funds for public utilities  has not been severely impacted by the market dislocation  these funds  and consequently our auction rate securities  have continued to perform 
the final market sector  noted above as other  is collateralized by long term debt of a seasoned issuer that deals in business machinery 
in determining whether there is an otti  management considers the factors noted above 
the financial performance indicators we review include  but are not limited to  net earnings  change in liquidity  and change in cash from operating activities  and  for money center banks  the regulatory capital ratios and the allowance for loan losses to the nonperforming loans 
through december   the auction rate securities have continued to pay interest at the highest rate as stipulated in the original prospectus  except for the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
in addition to valuing the auction rate securities ars by valuing the collateral  we completed discounted cash flow analyses 
in determining the appropriate cash flow analysis for our auction rate securities  the company reviewed multiple factors and prepared multiple discounted cash flow analyses 
the four main factors affecting our cash flow analysis for each ars were the expected future interest rate of the ars  the expected holding period  the expected principal to be received at the end of the holding period  and an assumed discount rate 
in determining the expected future interest rate  we used the current ars rate at december  and kept the rate constant for future cash flow estimates 
the current rates being paid on the majority of these securities are the maximum penalty rate and we believe that these rates will not change significantly in the future 
in addition  if the rates do increase or decrease in future periods  we believe that this would increase or decrease the risk profile of these securities which would cause a corresponding change in the discount rate assumption so the discounted cash flow analysis would not be significantly affected by interest rate changes 
in determining the expected holding period of each security using discounted cash flow analysis  we ran several scenarios 
these scenarios included holding the security until the trust dissolution date maturity date  and a five year scenario  inasmuch as we believe five years from december  would be the earliest that the ars market may resume the normal auction process 
the expected principal that we would receive in the discounted cash flow analysis was based upon two scenarios 
these scenarios included receiving par at the maturity date and at the five year assumed recovery date and receiving the market value of the underlying preferred shares at the maturity date and at the five year assumed recovery date 
under the terms of the ars agreements  we would receive the assets of the trust at the trust dissolution date which would constitute a conversion to the underlying preferred shares 
finally  in determining the discount rate  we reviewed numerous industry rates and determined a separate discount rate for each ars as follows we obtained the year credit default swap spread for each of the underlying issuers we believed that this was the most readily available information that would most closely represent an equivalent yield 
we then adjusted this rate by basis points depending on how far out the actual maturity date was in excess of years maturity dates range from approximately years to years 
we then added the year swap rate at december   and finally added or basis points for the illiquidity and other market risks 
the liquidity factor applied to these securities was based on the credit rating of the security basis points for securities above investment grade and basis points for securities slightly below investment grade 
the final discount rates ranged from 
for the freddie mac securities that we are holding as of december   we did not perform a discounted cash flow analysis 
these securities are no longer paying interest so a discounted cash flow analysis would show a value far less than what would be an appropriate fair value 
we believe that for these securities an analysis of the underlying value of the preferred shares is the best way to value these securities 
based on these analyses  the discounted cash flows ranged from a total of approximately million to million 
we believe that of these scenarios  the most likely scenario as of december  is that we will hold these securities to the maturity based on the high interest rates and will receive par 
however  we also verified the reasonableness of the value by analyzing receipt of the fair value of the underlying preferred securities at maturity 
the calculated fair values using the par value approach was million as compared to million using the underlying preferred securities 
the current fair value that the bank has recorded for the ars portfolio based on the value of the underlying securities is approximately million 
as our current fair value falls within the range of the discounted cash flows analyses performed and higher than the most likely scenarios  we believe that our current fair value is an appropriate representation of what a willing market participant would pay for these securities and is an accurate estimate of our ars fair value at december  based upon our methodology for determining the fair value of the auction rate securities  we recorded an otti charge of million for the year ended december  and an otti charge totaling million related to the freddie mac auction rate securities for the year ended december  we concluded that  as of december  and  the unrealized loss for the remainder of the auction rate securities is due to the market interest volatility  the continued illiquidity of the auction rate markets  and uncertainty in the financial markets as there has not been a deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer of the auction rate securities or a downgrade of the auction rate security from investment grade 
it is not more likely than not that the company would be required to sell the auction rate securities prior to recovery of the unrealized loss  nor does the company intend to sell the security at the present time 
at december   we had six auction rate securities totaling million which were below investment grade 
at december   we had six auction rate securities totaling million which were below investment grade 
during the year ended december  no auction rate securities were redeemed 
during the year ended december   approximately million of auction rate securities were redeemed with no gain or loss recognized 
during fiscal year  million of auction rate securities were sold at auction with no gain or loss recognized on the sale 
during the year ended december   million of federal national mortgage association fannie mae auction rate securities were converted into the underlying preferred shares and simultaneously sold recognizing a loss totaling million 
at both december  and  we had a trust preferred security issued by a non registrant regional bank with an amortized cost of million after otti charges and million  respectively  and a fair value of million and million  respectively 
there are no tranches associated with this security 
when this asset was acquired it was an investment grade security but has subsequently deteriorated to a non rated security 
the issuer of this security is experiencing deterioration of its loan portfolio and net losses  but appears to be prepared to rectify these adverse conditions as the controlling family contributed sufficient amounts to ensure this institution remains well capitalized 
this security has not defaulted nor deferred any interest payments as all interest has been paid as contractually stipulated 
based on an evaluation of the otti factors as fully described above during the year ended december   the company recorded a credit related otti charge of million 
the otti charge was determined using a price quote from an independent broker level as compared to the amortized cost as of december  at both december  and  we had one pooled trust preferred cdo tpcdo with an amortized cost of million after otti charges and a fair value of  and  respectively 
we own a class b tranche of the tpcdo  which was considered below investment grade at both december  and during the year ended december   we recognized a credit related impairment charge totaling million to reduce the amortized cost to million 
at december   we obtained discounted cash flow scenarios from independent third parties 
we used the most conservative result in order to value our tpcdo  which we believe also reflects the most likely expected cash flow 
the factors used to value the tpcdo were a discount rate of  a prepayment speed of  and default ratios based upon the texas ratios as noted 
historically  there have been no prepayments on this security but the issuers into the tpcdo can prepay at their discretion after january we used prepayment speed range of to in the cash flow analyses 
the cash flow analysis that we utilized in valuing the tpcdo used a prepayment speed for the next two years 
as there have been no prepayments and we continue to expect the underlying issuers in the tpcdo to focus on improving capital and liquidity  we expect prepayments to be minimal on this security 
we factored in a nominal prepayment assumption into our cash flow analysis as the underlying issuers have the right to prepay 
the discount rate used in our analysis was the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
for purposes of completing the cash flow analysis  defaults and deferrals are treated in the same manner 
at december  and  there were five institutions in deferral status which were excluded from the discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to estimate potential defaults and deferrals we segregated the underlying issuers by their texas ratio 
this ratio is a key indicator of the health of an institution and the likelihood of failure or deferral of payments 
we also reviewed other factors of each institution ie capital amounts and operating results to determine the likelihood of failure or deferral 
based on each issuers texas ratio and other mitigating factors  we applied an expected deferral default rate to each underlying issuer 
for the riskiest issuers texas ratios greater than  current deferrals with no mitigating factors a default assumption was applied 
for the institutions with certain risk factors texas ratios of to with no mitigating factors a default assumption was applied 
for the least risky institutions texas ratios less than no default assumption was applied 
based on industry analysis we determined that a texas ratio of or higher is a good indicator of a troubled institution and a texas ratio of to indicated certain risks

the below investment grade for the student lender was one factor evaluated in determining whether it was appropriate to recognize an otti 
we also considered and evaluated analysis prepared by two independent third party analysts and the financial data of the issuer 
the financial factors we evaluated included but are not limited to  net income  return on assets  increased cash and cash equivalents  increased originations  and the amount of debt included in current liabilities 
we also considered the effects of the student loan overhaul included in the health care legislation signed by president obama in march which will eliminate the student lender ability to originate new student loans 
management believes this security has a fair value below cost due to the weak economic environment  high unemployment  slow salary growth  and high consumer debt which has adversely affected income generation of the borrowers 
as a result  student loans have exhibited increased delinquency and defaults 
the student lender bond the company owns was purchased in prior to the current credit crisis and for which the underlying loans are guaranteed by the federal government at 
based upon the entirety of the evidence of the student lender corporate bond outlined above  management concluded that otti was not appropriate and that the unrealized loss was due to market factors 
at december  and  all other single issuer debt securities had a credit rating of investment grade 
during the year ended december   the company recorded otti charges related to four single issuer corporate bonds totaling million 
the company evaluated the length of time and extent the amortized cost exceeded fair value and the credit rating of the issuer 
during  two issuers filed for bankruptcy which resulted in a credit related otti charge of million 
the company concluded that the financial deterioration of these two issuers resulted in a credit loss 
the preponderance of the remainder of the loss was due to an airline company bond 
the airline company issuer had not shown improved earnings and operations since a merger in the fourth quarter of since there was no improvement  the company concluded full receipt of the principal was unlikely and recorded a credit related otti 
the amounts of the otti charges were determined based upon broker quotes level 
at december  and  the company owned preferred and common stock collectively equities 
the fair value of the equities was determined by quoted market prices  unrealized gain or loss was determined by comparing the cost of the equity to its fair value 
in order to determine whether otti should be recognized  we evaluated the length of time and the extent to which the fair value was below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the company intent and ability to retain the equity security to allow for recovery 
based upon the length of time these securities were in an unrealized loss position  the amount by which the cost exceeded fair value  and the financial prospects of the issuer  we recorded a million otti charge during the fiscal year ended december  there was no otti recognized on equities during the year ended december  the table below details certain information related to the equity securities as of december  and in thousands december  industry cost fair value unrealized gain loss common telecommunications airline preferred airline flooring and other mining december  industry cost fair value unrealized gain loss common telecommunications airline preferred airline flooring and other mining money center banks the company has investments in certain debt securities  as noted in the table below  that have unrealized losses or may be otherwise impaired  but otti has not been recognized in the financial statements as management believes the decline is due to the credit markets coupled with the interest rate environment

the company also had equity securities with an aggregate fair market value of million which were temporarily impaired at december  the total unrealized loss on these securities was  the preponderance of the unrealized loss for marketable equity securities and other is a  unrealized loss at december  on one money center bank preferred issue 
as the stock market declined in the first and second quarter of  especially related to the financial sector  the company investments decreased in value 
at march   the unrealized loss totaled  subsequent to march   the fair value of this security has rebounded to an unrealized position of  at december  the issuer of this preferred equity security has raised sufficient capital to repay the troubled asset relief program tarp funds  continue to pay its dividend  maintain its credit rating and remain well capitalized 
based upon these factors  coupled with the increasing stock market prices  especially in the financial sector  the company does not believe an otti charge is warranted at december  the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held to maturity  by contractual maturity  at december  and are shown below

the bank owns stock of the fhlbny which is necessary for it to be a member of the fhlbny 
membership requires the purchase of stock equal to of the bank mortgage related assets investments and loans plus of the outstanding borrowings 
the stock is redeemable at par 
therefore  its cost is equivalent to its redemption value 
the bank ability to redeem fhlbny shares is dependent upon the redemption practices of the fhlbny 
at december   the fhlbny neither placed restrictions on redemption of shares in excess of a member required investment in stock  nor stated that it will cease paying dividends 
the bank did not consider this asset impaired at either december  or loan portfolio loan portfolio composition 
the company loans consist primarily of mortgage loans secured by residential and non residential properties as well as commercial loans which are either unsecured or secured by personal property collateral 
most of the company loans are either made to individuals or personally guaranteed by the principals of the business to which the loan is made 
at december  and  the company had total loans  net of unearned income of million and million  respectively  and an allowance for loan losses of million and million  respectively 
from time to time  the bank may originate residential mortgage loans  sell them on the secondary market  normally recognizing fee income in connection with the sale 
interest rates on loans are affected by the demand for loans  the supply of money available for lending  credit risks  the rates offered by competitors and other conditions 
these factors are in turn affected by  among other things  economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  and legislative tax policies 
in order to manage interest rate risk  the bank focuses its efforts on loans with interest rates that adjust based upon changes in the prime rate or changes in united states treasury or similar indices 
generally  credit risks on adjustable rate loans are somewhat greater than on fixed rate loans primarily because  as interest rates rise  so do borrowers payments  increasing the potential for default 
the bank seeks to impose appropriate loan underwriting standards in order to protect against these and other credit related risks associated with its lending operations 
in addition to analyzing the income and assets of its borrowers when underwriting a loan  the bank obtains independent appraisals on all material real estate in which the bank takes a mortgage 
the bank generally obtains title insurance in order to protect against title defects on mortgaged property 
commercial mortgage loans 
the bank originates commercial mortgage loans secured by office buildings  retail establishments  multi family residential real estate and other types of commercial property 
substantially all of the properties are located in the new york city metropolitan area 
the bank generally makes commercial mortgage loans with loan to value ratios not to exceed and with terms to maturity that do not exceed years 
loans secured by commercial properties generally involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties  repayment may be subject  to a greater extent  to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies 
the bank evaluates the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower  including credit history  profitability and expertise  as well as the value and condition of the underlying property 
the factors considered by the bank include net operating income  the debt coverage ratio the ratio of cash net income to debt service  and the loan to value ratio 
when evaluating the borrower  the bank considers the financial resources and income level of the borrower  the borrower experience in owning or managing similar property and the bank lending experience with the borrower 
the bank policy requires borrowers to present evidence of the ability to repay the loan without having to resort to the sale of the mortgaged property 
the bank also seeks to focus its commercial mortgage loans on loans to companies with operating businesses  rather than passive real estate investors 
commercial loans 
the bank makes commercial loans to businesses for inventory financing  working capital  machinery and equipment purchases  expansion  and other business purposes 
these loans generally have higher yields than mortgage loans  with maturities of one year  after which the borrower financial condition and the terms of the loan are re evaluated 
at december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of the company total loan portfolio consisted of such loans 
commercial loans tend to present greater risks than mortgage loans because the collateral  if any  tends to be rapidly depreciable  difficult to sell at full value and is often easier to conceal 
in order to limit these risks  the bank evaluates these loans based upon the borrower ability to repay the loan from ongoing operations 
the bank considers the business history of the borrower and perceived stability of the business as important factors when considering applications for such loans 
occasionally  the borrower provides commercial or residential real estate collateral for such loans  in which case the value of the collateral may be a significant factor in the loan approval process 
residential mortgage loans to family loans 
the bank makes residential mortgage loans secured by first liens on one to four family owner occupied or rental residential real estate 
at december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of the company total loan portfolio consisted of such loans 
the bank offers both adjustable rate mortgages arms and fixed rate mortgage loans 
the relative proportion of fixed rate loans versus arms originated by the bank depends principally upon current customer preference  which is generally driven by economic and interest rate conditions and the pricing offered by the bank competitors 
at both december  and  approximately of the bank residential one to four family owner occupied first mortgage portfolio were arms and approximately were fixed rate loans 
the percentage represented by fixed rate loans tends to increase during periods of low interest rates 
the arms generally carry annual caps and life of loan ceilings  which limit interest rate adjustments 
the bank residential loan underwriting criteria are generally comparable to those required by fannie mae and other major secondary market loan purchasers 
generally  arm credit risks are somewhat greater than fixed rate loans primarily because  as interest rates rise  the borrowers payments rise  increasing the potential for default 
the bank teaser rate arms arms with low initial interest rates that are not based upon the index plus the margin for determining future rate adjustments were underwritten based on the payment due at the fully indexed rate 
in addition to verifying income and assets of borrowers  the bank obtains independent appraisals on all residential first mortgage loans and title insurance is required at closing 
private mortgage insurance is required on all loans with a loan to value ratio in excess of and the bank requires real estate tax escrows on such loans 
real estate tax escrows are voluntary on residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios of or less 
fixed rate residential mortgage loans are generally originated by the bank for terms of to years 
although year fixed rate mortgage loans may adversely affect our net interest income in periods of rising interest rates  the bank originates such loans to satisfy customer demand 
such loans are generally originated at initial interest rates which exceed the fully indexed rate on arms offered at the same time 
fixed rate residential mortgage loans originated by the bank generally include due on sale clauses  which permit the bank to demand payment in full if the borrower sells the property without the bank consent 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rates on the bank fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio  and the bank will generally exercise its rights under these clauses if necessary to maintain market yields 
arms originated in recent years have interest rates that adjust annually based upon the movement of the one year treasury bill constant maturity index  plus a margin of to 
these loans generally have a maximum interest rate adjustment of per year  with a lifetime maximum interest rate adjustment  measured from the initial interest rate  of or 
the bank offers a variety of other loan products including residential single family construction loans to persons who intend to occupy the property upon completion of construction  home equity loans secured by junior mortgages on one to four family owner occupied residences  and short term fixed rate consumer loans either unsecured or secured by monetary assets such as bank deposits and marketable securities or personal property 
at december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of the company total loan portfolio consisted of such other loan products 
origination of loans 
loan originations can be attributed to depositors  retail customers  phone inquiries  advertising  the efforts of the bank loan officers  and referrals from other borrowers  real estate brokers and builders 
the bank originates loans primarily through its own efforts  occasionally obtaining loan opportunities as a result of referrals from loan brokers 
at december   the bank was generally not permitted to make loans to one borrower in excess of approximately million  with an additional amount of approximately million being permitted if secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank was also not permitted to make any single loan in an amount in excess of approximately million 
at december   the bank was in compliance with these standards 
delinquency procedures 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the bank attempts to cause the deficiency to be cured by contacting the borrower 
the bank reviews past due loans on a case by case basis  taking the action it deems appropriate in order to collect the amount owed 
litigation may be necessary if other procedures are not successful 
judicial resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the bank first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
if a non mortgage loan becomes delinquent and satisfactory arrangements for payment cannot be made  the bank seeks to realize upon any personal property collateral to the extent feasible and collect any remaining amount owed from the borrower through legal proceedings  if necessary 
it is the bank policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan when it is days past due or if management believes that continued interest accruals are unjustified 
the bank may continue interest accruals if a loan is more than days past due if the bank determines that the nature of the delinquency and the collateral are such that collection of the principal and interest on the loan in full is reasonably assured 
when the accrual of interest is discontinued  all accrued but unpaid interest is charged against current period income 
once the accrual of interest is discontinued  the bank records interest as and when received until the loan is restored to accruing status 
if the bank determines that collection of the loan in full is in reasonable doubt  then amounts received are recorded as a reduction of principal until the loan is returned to accruing status

the bank prices its deposit offerings competitively within the market it serves 
these products are designed to attract new customers  retain existing customers and create opportunities to offer other bank products or services

short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within days from the date of the transactions

the details of these categories are presented below years ended december  dollars in thousands securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased balance at year end average during the year maximum month end balance weighted average rate during the year rate at december capital resources and liquidity liquidity the management of the company liquidity focuses on ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet loan funding commitments  withdrawals from deposit accounts  the repayment of borrowed funds  and ensuring that the bank and the company comply with regulatory liquidity requirements 
liquidity needs of the bank have historically been met by deposits  investments in federal funds sold  principal and interest payments on loans  and maturities of investment securities 
additional liquidity  up to approximately million is available from the federal reserve bank and the fhlbny 
the current uncertainties in the credit markets have negatively impacted our ability to liquidate  if necessary  investments in auction rate securities 
we are not certain as to when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve  however  we have the intent to hold these available for sale securities to maturity  and do not believe we will be required to sell these securities prior to maturity 
approximately million principal amount of auction rate securities that came due during the year ended december  were redeemed with no gain or loss recognized 
no auction rate securities came due during the year ended december  during the year ended december   million of auction rate securities were sold at auction with no gain or loss recognized 
at december   our portfolio of investment securities included approximately million  at cost  of corporate notes  including single issuer and pooled trust preferred securities  for which an otti charge has not been recorded in our financial statements

otti is a non cash charge and not necessarily an indicator of a permanent decline in value 
security valuations require significant estimates  judgments and assumptions by management and are considered a critical accounting policy of the company 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities and corporate notes to affect our capital  liquidity or our ability to execute our current business plan 
we have cash and cash equivalents totaling million  or of total assets at december  in addition  we have the capacity to borrow up to approximately million from the federal reserve bank and approximately million from the fhlbny if the need should arise

interest rate risk fluctuations in market interest rates can have a material effect on the bank net interest income because the yields earned on loans and investments may not adjust to market rates of interest with the same frequency  speed and extent as the rates paid by the bank on its deposits 
most of the bank deposits are either interest bearing demand deposits or short term certificates of deposit and other interest bearing deposits with interest rates that fluctuate as market rates change 
management of the bank seeks to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations by concentrating on loans and securities investments with either short terms to maturity or with adjustable rates or other features that cause yields to adjust based upon interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  to cushion itself against the potential adverse effects of a substantial and sustained increase in market interest rates  the bank has from time to time purchased off balance sheet interest rate cap contracts which generally provide that the bank will be entitled to receive payments from the other party to the contract if interest rates exceed specified levels 
these contracts  when written  are entered into with major financial institutions 
the company seeks to maximize its net interest margin within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of the forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to favorable or unfavorable movements in interest rates 
interest rate risk  or sensitivity  arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of liabilities 
in the banking industry  a traditional measure of interest rate sensitivity is known as gap analysis  which measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at various time intervals 
the following table sets forth the company interest rate repricing gaps for selected maturity periods berkshire bancorp inc interest rate sensitivity gap at december  in thousands  except for percentages months or less through months through years over years total fair value federal funds sold rate interest bearing deposits in banks rate loans adjustable rate loans rate fixed rate loans rate total loans investments rate total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts savings and now rate money market rate time deposits rate total deposit accounts repurchase agreements rate other borrowings rate total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate caps gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap to total rate sensitive assets adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which the interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which the loans mature 
fixed rate loans are scheduled according to their maturity dates 
includes nonaccrual loans 
investments are scheduled according to their respective repricing variable rate investments and maturity fixed rate securities dates 
investments are stated at book value 
now accounts and savings accounts are regarded as readily accessible withdrawal accounts 
the balances in such accounts have been allocated among maturity repricing periods based upon the berkshire bank historical experience 
all other time accounts are scheduled according to their respective maturity dates 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company financial statements measure financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of the company operations 
the assets and liabilities of the company are largely monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the direction  or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
however  in general  high inflation rates are accompanied by higher interest rates  and vice versa

internal control over financial reporting the objective of the company internal control program is to allow the bank and management to comply with part of the fdic regulations fdicia and to allow the company to comply with sections and of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
in november  the fdic amended part of its regulations by raising the asset size threshold from million to billion for internal control assessments by management and external auditors 
the final rule was effective december  section of sox requires the ceos and cfos of the company to i certify that the annual and quarterly reports filed with the securities and exchange commission are accurate and ii acknowledge that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining and periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures 
section of sox requires management to i report on internal control over financial reporting  ii assess the effectiveness of such internal controls  and iii obtain an external auditor report on management assessment of its internal control 
the company is not an accelerated filer as defined in rule b of the securities exchange act of on october   the sec issued a final extension of sox b for non accelerated filers  which would have required them to first comply with the provisions of section b of sox with respect to fiscal years ending on or after june  section b of sox requires a registrant to provide an attestation report on management assessment of internal controls over financial reporting by the registrant external auditor 
therefore  the company would have been required to obtain an external auditor attestation report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended december  however  on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law
