item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations from through  and our liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
executive overview we design  contract for the manufacture of and market a broad range of women collection sportswear  suits and dresses  casual sportswear and jeanswear for women and children  women footwear and accessories  and men jeanswear 
we sell our products through a broad array of distribution channels  including better specialty and department stores and mass merchandisers  primarily in the united states and canada 
we also operate our own network of retail and factory outlet stores and several e commerce web sites 
in addition  we license the use of several of our brand names to select manufacturers and distributors of women and men apparel and accessories worldwide 
during  the following significant events took place in january  we announced that glo jeans will be carried exclusively at kmart stores nationwide  in january  we announced that we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with vcjs llc vcjs to design  develop  produce and distribute jessica simpson jeanswear under the jessica simpson collection  on february   we announced that we had acquired moda nicola international  llc moda  owner of the robert rodriguez collection  a privately held designer  marketer and wholesaler of women contemporary eveningwear and sportswear  on may   we announced that our jeanswear division is entering the menswear market and had entered into an exclusive licensing and distribution agreement with g iii apparel group  ltd 
for andrew marc men jeanswear  on june   we announced that we had acquired a interest in stuart weitzman holdings  llc swh  a privately held designer and manufacturer of women salon footwear and accessories under the stuart weitzman label  pursuant to an acquisition agreement we entered into on may   which provides for our acquisition of the remaining interest on december   on june   we announced an amendment and extension of our existing million senior credit facility to provide for a decrease in fees and interest rates to current market rates and to extend the maturity date to may   on july   we announced that we had entered into an exclusive  world wide license agreement with inter parfums usa  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of inter parfums  inc for the creation  production  marketing and global distribution of women fragrances under the nine west brand  on august   we announced that we had entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with brian atwood to create  produce  market and distribute b brian atwood  a new footwear and accessory line that will be the contemporary counterpart to brian atwood high end  luxury shoe business  and on december   we announced that we had amended our exclusive licensing agreement with vcjs to add the design  development  production and distribution of jessica simpson sportswear under the jessica simpson collection 
trends the current economic environment has generally resulted in lower consumer confidence 
this trend may lead to reduced consumer spending  which would affect our net sales and our future profitability 
therefore  we have taken aggressive cost reduction actions during the past several years to address the uncertainty posed by economic conditions and to protect our future profitability 
we have recently completed major initiatives to simplify our distribution systems 
at december   we had two primary distribution systems compared to four at the end of  six distribution centers plus six third party logistics locations compared to distribution centers and three third party logistics locations at the end of and one customer service location compared to four at the end of 
we intend to seek additional opportunities to reduce distribution and operational costs while further improving the speed to market of our products 
for further information  see accrued restructuring costs in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that several significant trends are occurring in the apparel  footwear and accessories industry 
we believe the recent general increase in commodity  labor and transportation costs that we have experienced may continue into the future 
we may be limited in our ability to increase our selling prices to offset these increases 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  our margins could be adversely affected 
we believe a trend exists among our major customers to expand the differentiation of their offerings and to achieve strategic advantages over competitors by devoting more resources to the development of exclusive products whether products that the retailer designs under brands that it owns private labels or products produced exclusively for the retailer by national brand manufacturers 
retailers are placing more emphasis on developing their brand images and building strong images for their private label merchandise 
exclusive brands  as the term implies  are only available from a specific retailer  and thus customers loyal to these brands can only find them in the stores of that retailer 
we have responded to this trend by leveraging our design  production and marketing capabilities to develop and provide private label products for certain customers and to provide products under certain of our brands exclusively to select customers  such as providing lei products exclusively to walmart  rachel rachel roy products exclusively to macy and glo products exclusively to kmart 
while the private label lines compete directly with our product lines and may receive more prominent positioning on the retail floor by department stores  creating more competition  we believe that national brands are often preferred by the consumer 
furthermore  we believe a trend exists among our major customers to concentrate purchasing among a narrowing group of vendors 
in the future  retailers may have financial problems or continue to consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could increase the concentration of our customers 
we attempt to minimize our credit risk from our concentration of customers by closely monitoring accounts receivable balances and shipping levels and the ongoing financial performance and credit status of our customers 
consumers are increasing their purchasing of apparel  footwear and accessories through e commerce web sites

com and www 
rachelroy 
com web sites  we market either footwear and accessories  apparel or a combination of these products  primarily under their respective brand names 
the selection of products is substantially consistent with the product offerings in our corresponding retail store concepts 
our e commerce systems allow us to fulfill customer orders from inventory at our retail store locations if the items are not available at our distribution center 
on january   the world trade organization member nations lifted all quotas on apparel and textiles 
as a result  all textiles and textile apparel manufactured in a member nation and exported after january  are no longer subject to quota restrictions 
a special safeguard provision that had provided the us with an additional four years beyond january  to apply quotas on chinese imports of textiles expired on december  the lifting of quotas and expiration of safeguard provisions allows retailers  apparel firms and others to import unlimited quantities of apparel and textile items from china  india and other lower cost countries  which could lead to relatively lower production costs  allow us to improve the quality of our products for a given cost  or allow us to concentrate production in the most efficient markets 
in addition  if the prices of the imported goods can be shown to be less than those offered by domestic producers for the same items  the us international trade commission may recommend that anti dumping duties be imposed on those goods 
as a result  we are unable to predict the long term effects of the lifting of quota restrictions and related events on our results of operations 
retail store closings we continue to review our retail operations for underperforming locations 
as a result of this review  we have decided to close retail locations that no longer provide strategic benefits 
during and  we closed and locations  respectively  and anticipate closing additional locations in we accrued million and million of termination benefits and associated employee costs during and  respectively  for approximately  employees  including both store employees and administrative support personnel 
in connection with our decision to close these stores  we reviewed the associated long term assets for impairments 
as a result of this review  we recorded million and million of impairment losses in and  respectively  on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures located in the stores to be closed 
these costs are reported as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the retail segment 
acquisitions on february   we acquired of the membership interests in moda nicola international  llc moda  a privately held designer  marketer and wholesaler of women contemporary eveningwear and sportswear  and owner of the robert rodriguez collection  for million 
under the terms of the agreement  we made cash payments of million to the selling members of moda 
we deferred million of the purchase price  with payment subject to an indemnification holding period as set forth in the acquisition agreement 
the selling members of moda are also entitled to receive future cash payments upon achievement of certain financial targets set within the agreement for the years through at the acquisition date  we recorded an acquisition consideration liability for million  based on projected revenues and gross margins of the acquired business and a discount factor based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
adjustments to this liability are recorded as an sg a expense in our wholesale better apparel segment 
at december   the liability was million  with million recorded as an sg a expense during we pursued the acquisition of moda to increase our presence in the contemporary apparel market and to further develop a business portfolio with significant growth opportunities 
moda is reported as part of our wholesale better apparel segment 
on june   we acquired of the membership interests in stuart weitzman holdings  llc swh  a privately held designer and manufacturer of women salon footwear and accessories under the stuart weitzman label 
swh markets its products in fine specialty and department stores worldwide and in its own chain of retail stores in the us and abroad 
under the terms of the agreement  the acquisition will occur in two stages 
we made an initial cash payment of million for a interest in swh 
the purchase of the remaining will occur on december  the remaining purchase price will be determined under a formula set forth in the agreement  which is based upon the financial results of swh from through we recorded all swh identifiable assets  swh liabilities assumed and the noncontrolling interest at fair value under the acquisition method 
due to our obligation to purchase the remaining interest  the noncontrolling interest is classified as a liability  with adjustments to the liability recorded as interest expense 
we recorded a liability of million for the initial value of the projected payments for the remaining interest  based on probability weighted projected earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the agreement of the acquired business and cash distributions that are required by the agreement to be disbursed for through  using a discount factor based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the fair value of the liability was million  with million recorded as interest expense and million of payments recorded during we pursued the acquisition of swh to increase our presence in the contemporary footwear market and to further develop a business portfolio with significant growth opportunities 
swh wholesale footwear business is reported in our wholesale footwear and accessories segment  its retail business is reported in our retail segment  and its licensing business is reported in our licensing  eliminations and other segment 
the results of moda and swh are included in our results of operations from their respective acquisition dates 
critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve significant or complex judgements and uncertainties and require us to make certain critical accounting estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions that are subjective in nature or are about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made 
the estimates with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the collectibility of accounts receivable  the recovery value of obsolete or overstocked inventory and the fair values of goodwill  intangible assets with indefinite lives and acquisition consideration liabilities 
estimates related to accounts receivable and inventory affect our wholesale better apparel  wholesale jeanswear  wholesale footwear and accessories and retail segments 
estimates related to goodwill affect our wholesale better apparel and wholesale footwear and accessories segments 
estimates related to intangible assets with indefinite lives affect our licensing  other and eliminations segment 
for accounts receivable  we estimate the net collectibility  considering both historical and anticipated trends of trade discounts and co op advertising deductions taken by our customers  allowances we provide to our retail customers to flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our customers 
for inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through off price channels 
historically  actual results in these areas have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not anticipate that our estimates and assumptions are likely to materially change in the future 
however  if we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
accounting rules generally require that we test at least annually for possible goodwill impairment 
we test our goodwill and our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill balance existing in our wholesale footwear and accessories segment was impaired as a result of decreases in projected revenues  profitability and cash flows for this segment 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill balance existing in our retail segment was impaired as a result of decreases in projected revenues  profitability and cash flows for the segment 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
there were no impairment charges as a result of the impairment analysis 
we perform our annual impairment test for trademarks during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year 
as a result of the  and impairment analyses  we recorded trademark impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of decreases in projected revenues and cash flows for certain brands 
all trademark impairment charges are reported as sg a expenses in the licensing  other and eliminations segment 
for more information  see goodwill and other intangible assets in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we test both our goodwill and our trademarks for impairment by utilizing discounted cash flow models to estimate their fair values 
these cash flow models involve several assumptions 
changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trademark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
based on our latest annual testing  the following table shows the assumptions we used to derive our fair value estimates and the hypothetical additional impairment charge for goodwill and trademarks resulting from a one percentage point unfavorable change in each of our fair value assumptions dollar amounts in millions 
assumptions effect of one percentage point unfavorable change in goodwill trademarks goodwill trademarks discount rates none royalty rates weighted average revenue growth rates none long term growth rates none at december   we had million of goodwill  of which million has been assigned to the wholesale better apparel segment and has been assigned to the wholesale footwear and accessories segment 
we also had million of indefinite lived trademarks 
should the economic conditions and trends such as reduced consumer spending deteriorate throughout and beyond  the fair values of certain trademarks could become impaired 
we do not believe the remaining goodwill assigned to the wholesale better apparel segment will be impaired in the foreseeable future as the fair value of the wholesale better apparel segment at december  significantly exceeded the segment carrying value 
the goodwill assigned to the wholesale footwear and accessories segment is the result of the swh acquisition 
should the operations of swh fail to achieve projected results  this goodwill could become impaired 
at december   we had a total of million accrued for contingent consideration payments relating to the acquisitions of moda and swh 
these liabilities represent the present value  discounted at our weighted average cost of capital  of the projected payments based on i for moda  projected revenues and probability weighted gross margins for the years through  and ii for swh  probability weighted projected earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the acquisition agreement for through these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
other than the assumptions used in the impairment testing of our goodwill and trademarks  we have not made any material changes to any of our critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements

our board of directors has authorized our common stock repurchases as a tax effective means to enhance shareholder value and distribute cash to shareholders and  to a lesser extent  to offset the impact of dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of restricted stock and the exercise of employee stock options 
in authorizing share repurchase programs  our board of directors gives careful consideration to both our projected cash flows and our existing capital resources 
on june   we received a final delivery of million shares upon the conclusion of an accelerated stock repurchase asr program

borrowings under the credit facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business 
such borrowings bear interest either based on the alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facility  or based on eurocurrency rates  each with a margin that depends on the availability remaining under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
availability under the credit facility is determined with reference to a borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible inventory  accounts receivable  credit card receivables and licensee receivables  minus reserves determined by the joint collateral agents 
at december   we had no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  and our remaining availability was million 
if availability under the credit facility falls below a stated level  we will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio

the amended terms and conditions provide for an extension of the maturity date from march  to may  the amendment also provides for  among other things  the following changes to the credit facility a reduction in the interest rate spreads and commitment fees payable under the credit facility  changes in the borrowing base eligibility criteria for accounts owing by certain customers  foreign accounts and inventory in transit  changes in the calculation of the borrowing base relating to foreign accounts  the establishment in the joint collateral agents permitted discretion of reserves against the borrowing base for the senior notes due  the allowance of repayments and prepayments  including pursuant to open market purchases or a tender offer  of such notes subject to compliance with certain liquidity and or other conditions  an increase in the general debt basket from million to million and the addition of a new lien basket  and an extension of the grace period for events of default arising from the amount of open account obligations exceeding the applicable cap therefor 
swh has a million unsecured borrowing facility with a lending institution that expires on october  and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no cash borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding at december  cash borrowings under this facility bear interest based on either the prevailing prime rate or the prevailing libor rate plus basis points 
swh also has a million variable rate unsecured borrowing facility with a european lending institution that expires in march and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no amounts were outstanding at december  proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employees exercising stock options amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
no employees exercised stock options in we recorded net pension and postretirement expenses of million and million in and  respectively  to other comprehensive income resulting primarily from a lowering of the discount rate used to determine projected pension benefits 
we recorded net pension and postretirement expenses of million in to other comprehensive income resulting primarily from the downturn in the financial markets  which generated lower than expected returns on our plan assets 
our pension and postretirement plans are currently underfunded by a total of million 
as the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are frozen with respect to service credits  the effects on future pension expense are not anticipated to be material to our results of operations or to our liquidity 
we contributed million and million to our defined benefit plans in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit plans in on february   we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share to all common stockholders of record as of february  for payment on march  economic outlook the recent economic environment has resulted in lower consumer confidence 
this may lead to reduced consumer spending from recent experience  which could affect our net sales and our future profitability 
reduced consumer spending  combined with the potential for rising costs related to changes in foreign exchange rates  increasing labor costs primarily in asia and commodity prices and increasing transportation costs may reduce our gross profit margins from present levels 
we may be limited in our ability to increase our selling prices to offset rising costs 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  these rising costs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are manufactured in many foreign countries  including china and spain 
due to the current and expected future economic relationship between the united states and china  we may experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates should china allow the yuan to rise in value against the dollar 
we may also experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency rates between the euro and the dollar due to economic conditions in europe 
should either of these occur  increased production costs for our goods manufactured in china and spain could result 
when adverse economic conditions exist in the united states or abroad  we may experience increased risk related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and we may increase our provision for doubtful accounts in the future should any of our wholesale customers experience significant financial difficulties 
if such conditions lead to defaults that are individually or cumulatively significant  we could experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
the economic turmoil in the credit markets over the past several years and the negative effects of the economic environment on our business may negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
however  we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  funds generated by operations and the credit facility will provide the financial resources sufficient to meet our foreseeable working capital  dividend  capital expenditure and stock repurchase requirements and fund our contractual obligations and our acquisition liabilities and commitments 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the participating banks will be willing and able to loan funds to us in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market value of our fixed rate long term debt 
we manage this exposure through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures  including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following quantitative disclosures were derived using quoted market prices  yields and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments  taking into consideration the underlying terms  such as the coupon rate  term to maturity and imbedded call options 
certain items such as lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits were not included in the analysis 
for further information see derivatives and financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rates our primary interest rate exposures relate to the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt and interest expense related to our revolving credit facility 
at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt was million 
on that date  the potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate long term debt instruments resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates was approximately million 
our primary interest rate exposures on variable rate credit facilities are with respect to united states and canadian short term rates 
cash borrowings under these facilities bear interest at rates that vary with changes in prevailing market rates 
at december   we had million in variable rate credit facilities  under which no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
at december   we had outstanding interest rate swaps to convert our million senior notes due the notes to variable rate debt and an interest rate cap to limit our exposure to increases in the variable rates of our interest rate swaps 
under the terms of the swap contracts  we are required to make semiannual variable rate payments to the counterparties calculated based on three month libor rates which are reset on the th day of each calendar quarter plus  and the counterparties were obligated to make semiannual fixed rate payments to us of 
we also entered into an interest rate cap  at a cost of million  that limits our three month libor rate exposure to 
the swap and cap transactions have a termination date of november   the date the notes mature 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of million and the fair value of the interest rate cap was an asset of million 
the maximum future net cash payments that could be made under these contracts are estimated to be million 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our products have historically been purchased from foreign manufacturers in pre set united states dollar prices 
with the acquisition of swh  we also purchase certain products in euros 
we also have assets  liabilities and intercompany accounts denominated in certain foreign currencies that generate exchange gains and losses as exchange rates change 
to date  we generally have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
at december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to exchange canadian dollars for a total notional value of us million at a weighted average exchange rate of maturing through november the fair value of these contracts at december  was a million unrealized loss 
we believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform its obligation 
however  we do not expect the counterparty  which presently has a high credit rating  to fail to meet its obligations
