item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
each of our properties is run by a park general manager and operates autonomously 
management reviews operating results  evaluates performance and makes operating decisions  including the allocation of resources  on a property by property basis 
in order to better facilitate discussion of trends in attendance and guest per capita spending than would be possible on a consolidated basis  our eleven amusement parks and six separately gated water parks have been grouped into regional designations 
the northern region  which is the largest  includes cedar point and the adjacent soak city water park  kings island  canada wonderland  dorney park  valleyfair  geauga lake and michigan adventure 
the southern region includes kings dominion  carowinds  worlds of fun and oceans of fun 
finally  our western region includes knott berry farm  great america and the soak city water parks located in palm springs  san diego and adjacent to knott berry farm 
this region also includes the management contract with gilroy gardens family theme park in gilroy  california 
aside from attendance and guest per capita statistics  discrete financial information and operating results are not prepared at the regional level  but rather at the individual park level for use by the ceo  who is the chief operating decision maker codm  as well as by the cfo  the park general managers  and two executive vice presidents  who report directly to the ceo and to whom our park general managers report

table of contents critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level park level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of the fourth quarter  we concluded based on operating results  as well as updated forecasts  that a review of the carrying value of long lived assets at california great america was warranted 
after performing our review  we determined that a portion of the park fixed assets  the majority of which were originally recorded with the paramount parks ppi acquisition  were impaired 
as a result  we recognized million of fixed asset impairment as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  including trade names  are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in equity price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  which is estimated using both an income discounted cash flow and market approach 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
goodwill and trade names have been assigned at the reporting unit  or park level  for purposes of impairment testing 
historically  goodwill related to parks acquired prior to has been annually tested for impairment as of october  while goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  including trade name intangibles  related to the ppi acquisition in have been annually tested for impairment as of april effective in december  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment tests from april and october to december to more closely align the impairment testing procedures with our long range planning and forecasting process  which occurs in the fourth quarter each year 
we believe the change is preferable since the long term cash flow projections are a key component in performing our annual impairment tests of goodwill 
in addition  we changed the date of our annual impairment test for other indefinite lived intangibles from april to december during  we tested goodwill for impairment as of april  or october   as applicable  and again as of december  the tests indicated no impairment of goodwill as of any of those dates 
other indefinite lived intangibles were tested for impairment as of april  and december  after performing the april  impairment test  we determined that a portion of trade names at certain ppi parks were impaired as the carrying values of those trade names exceeded their fair values 
as a result we recognized million of trade name impairment during the second quarter of this impairment was driven mainly by an increase in our cost of capital in and lower 
table of contents projected growth rates for certain parks as of the test date 
after performing the december  impairment test  we determined that a portion of the trade names at great america  originally recorded with the ppi acquisition  were impaired 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of trade name impairment during the fourth quarter of the change in accounting principle related to changing the annual goodwill impairment testing date did not delay  accelerate  avoid or cause an impairment charge 
as it was impracticable to objectively determine operating and valuation estimates for periods prior to december   we have prospectively applied the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date from december  it is possible that our assumptions about future performance  as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our reporting units parks  could change adversely  which may result in additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
at december   two of our reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values by greater than  and a third reporting unit had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable 
reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third party estimates of settlement costs 
reserves for ibnr claims  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements  are based upon our own claims data history  as well as industry averages 
all reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted periodically during the season 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
revenues on admission tickets for the next operating season  including season passes  are deferred in the year received and recognized as revenue in the following year

the improved attendance was largely due to an increase in season pass visits  the result of an increase in the number of season passes sold  particularly at our parks in the southern and western regions 
in addition  attendance in benefited from an increase in group sales business as many of our parks saw the return of numerous group bookings that were lost in  as well as favorable weather conditions throughout much of the operating season  including the all important fall season 
the increase in revenues also reflects an increase of  or approximately million  in out of park revenues  which represents the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by an increase in occupancy and average daily room rates at most of our hotel properties 
slightly offsetting the increases in attendance and out of park revenues was a less than  or  decrease in average in park guest per capita spending for the year 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park  plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
for the fiscal year  average in park per capita spending increased in the northern region  but this increase was offset by declines in per capita spending in the southern and western regions 
the declines in those regions were in part the result of the increase in season pass visits 
the increase in revenues for the fiscal year also reflects the impact of currency exchange rates and the weakening us dollar on our canadian operations approximately million during the year 
operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million versus million for the increase reflects million of costs incurred in in connection with the terminated apollo merger  an increase in scheduled maintenance expense across the parks of approximately million  increases in operating supplies and seasonal wages of approximately million and million  respectively  the result of increased attendance  and the negative impact of currency exchange rates on our canadian operating expenses of approximately million during the year 
the comparison between years is also affected by certain one time costs incurred in  including million of litigation costs for the settlement of a california class action lawsuit and a license dispute with paramount pictures  as well as million of costs for the terminated apollo merger 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year decreased million due primarily to lower amortization expense in resulting from the accelerated amortization in of the intangible asset related to the nickelodeon licensing agreement  which was not renewed at the end of during the second and fourth quarters of  we recognized non cash charges of million and million  respectively  for the partial impairment of trade names originally recorded at the time of the ppi acquisition 
this compares with a non cash charge of million for the impairment of trade names in additionally in the fourth quarter  we recognized a non cash charge of million at great america for the partial impairment of its fixed assets and a million charge for asset retirements across all properties 
although the acquisition of the ppi parks continues to meet our collective operating and profitability goals  the performance of certain acquired parks fell below our original expectations in  which when coupled with a higher cost of capital  resulted in the impairment charges recorded in it is important to 
table of contents note that each of the acquired ppi parks produces positive cash flow  and that trade name write downs and fixed asset impairment losses do not affect cash  adjusted ebitda or liquidity 
the comparison of operating income between years is also affected by a million gain on the sale of other assets in in late august of  we completed the sale of acres of surplus land at canada wonderland to the vaughan health campus of care in ontario  canada as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce debt 
net proceeds from this sale totaled million and resulted in the recognition of a million gain during after this gain  as well as depreciation  amortization  impairment losses and all other operating costs  operating income for decreased million to million compared with million in in july  we completed the refinancing of our outstanding debt by issuing million of senior unsecured notes and entering into a new  million credit agreement  resulting in the recognition of a million loss during the year on the early extinguishment of our previous debt 
as a result of the financing  as well as the august amendment that extended million of term debt  interest rate spreads were higher during than a year ago 
based on the higher interest rate spreads  interest expense for increased million to million from million in during  the net effect of our swaps increased million to a non cash charge to earnings of million  reflecting the regularly scheduled amortization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the swaps  offset somewhat by gains from marking the ineffective and de designated swaps to market and foreign currency gains related to the us dollar denominated canadian term loan in the current period 
during the year  we also recognized a million benefit to earnings for unrealized realized foreign currency gains  million of which represents an unrealized foreign currency gain on the us dollar denominated notes issued in july and held at our canadian property 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a benefit to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a provision for taxes of million in  consisting of million for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries and million for ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net loss for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
we believe adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure of our operating results for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including how we define and use adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on pages 
in  adjusted ebitda as defined by our credit agreement increased million  or  to million  with our adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda divided by net revenues increasing basis points bps to from in the increase in margin in was largely due to increased attendance which led to strong operating results during the peak summer months of july and august  as well as the ever growing fall season  and continued disciplined cost containment throughout the year

the revenue decline also represents a decrease of  or  in average in park per capita spending for in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
excluding the effects of the closing of star trek the experience in  the decrease in per capita spending for the period would have been  or less than when compared with out of park revenues  which represent the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates  decreased  or million between years  due primarily to declines in occupancy rates at most of our hotel properties 
operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease in operating costs was the result of the successful implementation of numerous cost savings initiatives  a reduction in variable costs due to a decrease in attendance  and the closing of star trek the experience in late together  these items reduced core operating costs by approximately million  or  in this reduction in operating costs was offset somewhat by million of charges during the year related to the terminated apollo merger and litigation settlements discussed earlier 
as mentioned in our vs 
discussion above  in we recognized a million gain on the sale of acres of surplus land at canada wonderland 
after the gain on the sale of the canadian land  depreciation  amortization  loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets  and all other non cash costs  operating income for the period increased million to million in compared with million in the increase in operating income was affected by the recording of non cash charges in of million for the impairment of trade names that were originally recorded when we acquired the ppi parks in  compared with non cash charges of million and million recorded in for impairment of goodwill and trade names  respectively 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these impairment charges 
in  depreciation and amortization increased million from this increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of million  offset by a decrease in depreciation of million 
the increase in amortization expense reflects the accelerated amortization of the intangible asset related to the nickelodeon licensing agreement 
during  it was determined that we would not be renewing the licensing agreement  which expired on december   thus triggering the accelerated amortization 
interest expense for decreased million to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate outstanding borrowings along with lower average debt balances  offset slightly by a basis point increase in interest 
table of contents costs on million of term debt borrowings that were extended by two years in august during  we retired million of term debt through regularly scheduled debt amortization payments  as well as the use of available cash from the reduction in our annual distribution rate and the net proceeds from the sale of excess land at canada wonderland 
net change in fair value of swaps and other income expense  net  increased million compared with this increase was primarily a result of recording a million non cash charge to income for the change in the mark to market valuations of our swaps that had gone ineffective or were de designated for hedge accounting during the year  as well as the related amortization of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive loss 
in  the swaps were highly effective and the change in the mark to market valuations were appropriately recorded in other comprehensive loss 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a provision to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a benefit for taxes of million in  consisting of a million benefit for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries and a million provision for ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
in  adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  to million  with our adjusted ebitda margin decreasing basis points bps to from in the decrease in margin in was due to a decrease in net revenues  caused primarily by a decrease in group business  only being partially offset by cost control initiatives implemented in for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including how we define and use adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on pages financial condition with respect to both liquidity and cash flow  we ended in sound condition 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  was the result of our highly seasonal business  as well as the impact of the fair value liability of our interest rate swap agreements that expire in october becoming current 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in decreased million to million from million in the decrease in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the negative change in working capital  excluding the impact of debt related and non cash items  offset somewhat by the increase in the operating results of our parks 
net cash from operating activities in decreased million to million compared with million in the decrease in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating results of our parks  offset by lower interest and income tax payments and a favorable change in working capital 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our parks and resort properties 
during  cash used for investing activities totaled million for capital investments  compared to million in and million in the change between years was primarily the result of a million influx of cash in from the sale of excess land at canada wonderland 
in addition  the total includes million received from cbs corporation as final settlement of a purchase price working capital adjustment related to the acquisition of ppi 
in and  cash used for capital investments totaled million and million  respectively 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial capital investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as to generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations 
for the operating season  we will be investing approximately million in capital investments across our properties  with the highlight of the program being the addition of four thrill seeking foot tall swing rides  one at each of cedar point  knott berry farm  canada wonderland and kings island 
in addition to great new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including the re theming of children areas at three of our parks to the peanuts characters and the addition of a night time light show and display at three of our parks  which will be similar to shows introduced at several of our parks over the past two seasons that have proved to be very popular with guests 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities in  which reflects the july refinancing of our debt  totaled million  compared with million in and million in the million decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily attributable to lower distribution payments made to partners in million compared to million 
reflected in the total is the retirement of million of term debt with funds obtained from the sale of excess land near canada wonderland 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in july  we issued million of senior unsecured notes the notes in a private placement  including million of original issue discount to yield 
the notes mature in concurrently with this offering  we entered into a new  million credit agreement the credit agreement  which includes a  million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the net proceeds from the offering of the notes  along with borrowings under the credit agreement  were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facilities 
on february   we amended the credit agreement and extended the maturity date of the us term loan portion of the credit facilities by one year 
certain terms of the amendment are described below 
terms of the credit agreement include a reduction in our previous million revolving credit facilities to a combined million facility 
under the new agreement  the canadian portion of the revolving credit facility has a limit of million 
us denominated loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian portion of the facility also bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
the revolving credit facility  which matures in july  also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
the extended us term loan  as amended on february   will amortize at million per year beginning in and mature in december the extended us term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 
until our recent amendment to the credit agreement  the us term loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 
at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt  million of the fixed rate notes  and million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
of our total term debt outstanding at the end of the year  none was scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
our million of notes require semi annual interest payments in february and august  with the principal due in full on august  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time prior to august  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make whole premium together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
thereafter  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at various prices depending on the date redeemed 
prior to august   up to of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at in  we entered into several fixed rate interest rate swap agreements totaling billion 
the weighted average fixed libor rate on the interest rate swaps  which mature in october  is 
based upon our scheduled quarterly regression analysis testing for the effectiveness of the accounting treatment of these swaps  as well as changes in the forward interest rate yield curves used in that testing  the swaps were deemed to be ineffective beginning in october and continuing through december  this resulted in the swaps not qualifying for hedge accounting during the fourth quarter of and all of the fair market value of these instruments at december  was a million liability  which was recorded in current derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
in  we entered into two cross currency swap agreements  which mature in february and effectively converted million of term debt at the time  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
as a result of paying down the underlying canadian term debt with net proceeds from the sale of surplus land near canada s wonderland in august  the notional amounts of the underlying debt and the cross currency swaps no longer match 
because of the mismatch of the notional amounts  we determined the swaps would no longer be highly effective going forward  resulting in the de designation of the swaps as of the end of august the fair market value of these instruments at december  was a million liability  which was recorded in derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following table presents our existing fixed rate swaps  which mature october   along with their notional amounts and their fixed interest rates  which compare to day libor of as of december  the table also presents our cross currency swaps and their notional amounts and interest rates as of december  s in thousands interest rate swaps cross currency swaps notional amounts libor rate notional amounts implied interest rate total s average rate 
table of contents in order to maintain fixed interest costs on a portion of our domestic term debt beyond the expiration of the existing swaps  in september we entered into several forward starting swap agreements that will effectively convert a total of million of libor based variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october the weighted average fixed rate on these libor based interest rate swaps  which mature in december  is 
the fair market value of these instruments at december  was million  which was recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet

the most critical of these ratios is the consolidated leverage ratio 
at the end of  this ratio was set at x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda 
as of december   our consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to consolidated ebitda ratio was x  providing million of consolidated ebitda cushion on the consolidated leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all other covenants under the credit agreement as of december  the credit agreement  as amended february   also includes provisions that allow us to make restricted payments of up to million in and up to million annually thereafter  at the discretion of the board of directors  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the restricted payment limitation in place under the agreement during and prior to the recent amendment capped the annual amount of permitted restricted payments at million 
these restricted payments are not subject to any specific covenants 
beginning in  additional restricted payments are allowed to be made based on an excess cash flow formula  should our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda as defined  measured on a quarterly basis 
per the terms of the indenture governing our notes  our ability to make restricted payments in and beyond is permitted should our trailing twelve month total indebtedness to consolidated cash flow ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total indebtedness including average revolving debt to consolidated ebitda  measured on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with these provisions  on october   we announced the declaration of a distribution of per limited partner unit  which was paid on december  on february   we announced the declaration of a distribution of per limited partner unit  which is payable on march  in addition to the above mentioned covenants and provisions  the credit agreement contains an initial three year requirement that at least of our aggregate term debt and senior notes be subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection 
existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet working capital needs  debt service  partnership distributions and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the currency exchange rates as of december  represents contractual lease and purchase obligations in place at year end 
off balance sheet arrangements we had million in the letters of credit  which are primarily in place to backstop insurance arrangements  outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of december  we have no other significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed rate long term debt  interest rate swaps  which fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure from the canadian dollar through the use of foreign currency denominated debt 
hedging of the us dollar denominated debt  used to fund a substantial portion of our net investment in our canadian operations  is accomplished through the use of cross currency swaps 
any gain or loss on the effective hedging instrument primarily offsets the gain or loss on the underlying debt 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december   all of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt 
assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately million  a hypothetical bps increase in day libor on our variable rate debt would lead to a decrease of approximately million in annual cash interest costs due to the impact of our fixed rate swap agreements 
a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a million decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes  and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates which are consistent with federal and state minimum wage laws 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
