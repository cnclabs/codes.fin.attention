item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview although fiscal brought a long awaited recovery in commercial aerospace markets for our investment cast products and forged products segments  we continued to face challenges in the power markets and in all markets for our fastener products segment 
while overall industrial gas turbine igt markets remained relatively flat in fiscal  we continued to experience significant weakness in sales volumes and pricing for our forged products seamless extruded pipe products 
despite these challenges  we achieved solid year over year increases in sales  operating income  net income from continuing operations  and earnings per share 
these results were primarily driven by strong aerospace and general industrial growth and continued focus on maximizing operational leverage 
we also generated  million of cash from operations and our cash balance reached a record level of more than billion 
as part of our continued focus on expanding our product lines and markets  we completed two small acquisitions in fiscal  and in may  we agreed to acquire the assets of pb fasteners  a strategically important acquisition that will improve our position on new  advanced composite based aerospace platforms 
in january  we acquired an additional equity interest in yangzhou chengde steel tube co  ltd chengde for approximately million in cash  increasing our equity interest to 
chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless  extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants  as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications  such as compressed natural gas 
also  during the year  we continued to upgrade manufacturing equipment and increase operational productivity with the completion or initiation of various large scale cost reduction projects  primarily within the forged products segment 
we expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal to be moderately higher than fiscal based on our current forecasts 
these expenditures will be targeted for cost reduction projects and equipment upgrades within our forged products and investment cast products segments 
capacity expansion projects that arise in excess of the base forecast will be evaluated on their own merits during the fiscal year based on demand 
during the latter half of fiscal  we received orders for aerospace castings and forgings from our customers to support previously announced build rates of both base commercial aircraft programs and the boeing we believe these orders will help drive sales increases through calendar and beyond 
in our fastener products segment  we expect to transition gradually toward a similar recovery in original equipment manufacturer oem and distributor orders toward the back end of fiscal  once production rates associated with current build rates deplete our customers current inventories 
we are seeing some promising upside in our other major markets  including opportunities in our seamless pipe business  and we expect to gain some traction in our igt operations as the year progresses 
from many perspectives market position  manufacturing discipline  balance sheet we have a solid foundation for continued profitable growth 
we are well positioned with our customer base to grow sales and build our share in the years ahead 
we will continue to focus on opportunities targeted at increasing the overall value of the company

contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months 
with regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry  based on data from the airline monitor as of january  boeing and airbus aircraft deliveries are expected to moderately increase through calendar year as compared to due to manufacturing lead times and scheduled build rates  our production volumes are generally to months ahead of aircraft deliveries 
the airline monitor is projecting further growth in aircraft deliveries in calendar year primarily driven by boeing production rates  and therefore we anticipate that our aerospace sales will continue to increase modestly through fiscal cost of goods sold was  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal as compared to  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was negatively impacted by the reduced seamless pipe volume  which was replaced by lower margin general industrial sales in the forged products segment 
in addition  lower sales of core product lines in the fasteners products segment were replaced with sales of less complex  lower margin products 
these decreases were partially offset by the effective leverage of increased aerospace volume due to significantly improved cost structures throughout the company 
contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year

discontinued operations our financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of certain of our businesses 
these businesses have been accounted for under discontinued operations guidance 
accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in our consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold an automotive fastener business 
the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million net of tax 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  we decided to divest a small non core business in the fastener products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations 
fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to dispose of a small non core business in the fasteners products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations 
the sale of the business was completed in the second quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to divest a small non core business in the investment cast products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations 
the sale of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million net of tax in fiscal fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations 
the decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market 
these operations were reclassified from the fasteners products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal we recognized an impairment loss of approximately million net of tax in the second quarter of fiscal related to these automotive fastener businesses held for sale due to continued erosion in the automotive market 
the sale of these businesses was completed in the second quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold the stock of several small entities  a group of foreign operations held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former flow technologies pumps and valves business 
the transaction resulted in a net gain of approximately million in fiscal restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges we regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions  taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve 
during fiscal and  we did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges 
the following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments 
we had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal  whereas demand decreased  particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets 
the charges consisted of million for employee severance expenses and million for impairments and relocation expenses associated with long lived assets 
these restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal the restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the investment cast products segment  forged products segment and fastener products segment were million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
as of april  and march   no accrued liabilities remained related to the restructuring plans

impacts of the global economic recession and recovery economic events created recessionary economic conditions around the world in many industries in fiscal and although many countries and industries are recovering  weakness persists in certain areas 
while we are not immune to impacts from the lingering effects of the global recession  we believe our strong financial position enables us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served  continue to make operational improvements in our businesses and benefit from the continuing economic recovery 
during fiscal and fiscal  approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets 
until the recession occurred and aerospace program delays were announced  customer schedules indicated that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal and possibly beyond  particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new commercial aerospace programs such as the boeing 
table of contents and airbus a  each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for pcc 
aerospace production rates began to recover in fiscal as compared with fiscal levels  and we have seen a realignment of component build rates and aircraft production schedules indicating an end to destocking in the supply chain 
we expect to see further order increases as boeing production starts to ramp up in the latter half of fiscal  as well as increased build rates on other commercial aircraft model production projected for fiscal our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large  well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather economic downturns 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 
during fiscal and fiscal  approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our sales were to customers in the global power markets  which include our igt business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe 
demand in our oem igt markets has softened  and during the latter half of fiscal  we experienced the beginning of destocking by our european customers  which continued through the first half of our fiscal starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we have experienced significant sales declines in our seamless pipe products as chinese customers utilize existing inventory 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 
the remaining percent and percent of our respective sales in fiscal and fiscal were into general industrial markets 
it is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets  because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another 
we experienced declines in general industrial sales during the recession but have seen a recovery in the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal in sales to general industrial markets 
this recovery helped replace sales in power markets as noted above 
we follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans 
the investments in our pension plans totaled approximately billion at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans  including voluntary contributions of million  to increase plan funding 
we believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable 
we made a voluntary contribution of million to the defined benefit pension plans in early fiscal in addition  the investments in our plans experienced positive returns of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as global investment markets recovered after experiencing losses of million during the recession in fiscal see the changes in financial condition and liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity

general industrial sales also showed continued strength  increasing by approximately million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
fiscal also includes four quarters of sales from carlton  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a decline in power markets of approximately million  or percent  compared to the prior year due to significantly lower core seamless pipe shipments 
higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segment s three primary mills added approximately million to top line revenues in fiscal versus fiscal fiscal sales also include million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to million last year  a decrease of million 
operating income for the forged products segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the slight increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace volume and the contribution from increased general industrial business  partially offset by weak seamless pipe performance 
the segment operating margin decreased by more than percentage points in the current year due to the negative impact of reduced seamless pipe volume and pricing 
growth in the segment lower margin general industrial markets also negatively impacted operating margin 
higher metal selling prices at the segment three primary mills diluted operating margins by percentage points in the current year 
the contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 
the segment s aerospace oem schedules are showing solid increases as previously announced build rates in both base commercial aircraft and boeing production ramp up  which will continue to drive aerospace sales levels through fiscal 
table of contents and beyond 
seamless pipe shipments within this segment began to improve toward the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the trend is expected to continue in fiscal operating income is expected to show improvement  benefiting from some recovery of core seamless pipe sales and higher aerospace sales 
fiscal compared with fiscal the forged products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a decrease of percent from the prior year s sales of  million

sales by market aerospace of total power of total general industrial other of total total sales operating income of sales fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
strong general industrial sales helped to increase year over year sales by approximately million  or percent 
offsetting this increase was a decline in aerospace fastener sales of approximately million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
aerospace volume suffered from delays in the boeing production schedule and continued weakness in orders from distributors  as current aircraft production was supplied out of existing customer inventory 
this segment was able to increase sales of lower margin  non core aerospace products in order to maintain volume and mitigate the impact of the decline in core aerospace sales 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal segment operating margins were negatively affected by the shift away from core aerospace products to lower margin  less complex fasteners  and increased general industrial volume 

table of contents the most significant future catalysts for segment growth continue to be the boeing ramp up and the recovery of fastener distribution orders 
as those inventory levels fall  and production demand increases  the segment is poised to benefit from market improvement and additional share gains anticipated to begin toward the latter half of fiscal these increased volumes  driven across the business improved cost structure  will help the segment achieve stronger operational performance 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent decrease from fiscal sales of  million

this payment and the related administrative changes remove pcc and its affiliates from any further financial  administrative or fiduciary responsibilities to this plan  and we therefore accounted for these events as a settlement of the plan and reversed the related liability 
there was no significant gain or loss associated with the settlement 
we believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations  borrowings from our existing billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities  the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
our revolving bank credit facility credit agreement provides available borrowing up to billion through may our unused borrowing capacity as of april  was million under the credit agreement  reduced by a million workers compensation letter of credit issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit agreement contains various standard financial covenants  including maintenance of minimum net worth  interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement are our most restrictive covenants 
our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of april  were as follows dollars in millions covenant requirement actual consolidated minimum net worth minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum terms are defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements 
historically  we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity 
we believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper and have issued commercial paper to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements in recent quarters 
during fiscal  the largest daily balance of outstanding commercial paper borrowings was million early in the first quarter with all borrowings repaid prior to the end of the second quarter 
we do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility  but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
should that circumstance arise  we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing  although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be  or the source of the borrowed funds 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents our contractual payment obligations as of april  and the estimated timing of future cash payments contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt total operating lease obligations include million attributable to an operation held for sale 
interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates 

table of contents our reserve for uncertain tax positions at april  was million 
due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities 
as a result  our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
the table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately million over the next five years million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value  with the market value being determined based on sales in the ordinary course of business 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
we also regularly review inventory balances on a lifo basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date 
for those inventories valued using lifo  their carrying value may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory  since the lifo costing assumption matches current costs with current sales  not with current inventory values 
when the lifo cost is greater than the current cost  there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write downs to market value 
while historical write downs have not been material  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to our continuing operations are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
for fiscal  our reporting units consisted of two operating segments within our investment cast products reportable operating segment  two operating segments within our forged products reportable operating segment  as well as three reporting units in our fasteners products reportable operating segment 
the fasteners products operating segment includes several aggregated component units referred to as the fasteners products reporting unit and two other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance 

table of contents testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rates  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and the discount rate applied  which reflects the weighted average cost of capital 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill 
we also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis ranged from to depending on the reporting unit 
the annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from to over the initial five year forecast period 
a sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of  or would not result in impairment in the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by or the discount rate utilized could increase by  and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired 
the reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has million of goodwill recorded as of april  the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is recorded 
for fiscal and  it was determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than the carrying value 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental reserves accrued at april  and march  were million and million  respectively 
guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
this guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities 
however  we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases  and we have no current plans to cease production in the future 
these asset retirement obligations  when estimable  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax 
table of contents benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we sponsor many us and us defined benefit pension plans 
our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance 
plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance 
pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
for valuation of our pension liabilities  we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality  liquid fixed income securities at the end of our fiscal year 
we use only highly rated bonds aa aa or higher to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be effectively settled 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our april  measurement date 
for our non us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our april  measurement date 
in developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate input from third party investment consultants and actuaries  review asset allocation and investment strategies  ranges of projected and historical returns  and inflation and economic assumptions 
the expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the company target asset allocation ranges consistent with our diversified investment approach 
as the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption  it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate  which is a point in time measurement 
for our us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our non us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense was million and non us net periodic pension income was million 
we estimate that for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million and non us net periodic pension income will be approximately million 
our us net postretirement benefit cost was million for fiscal  and we estimate that for fiscal  our us net postretirement benefit cost will be million 
the table below quantifies the approximate impact  as of april   of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets  holding other assumptions constant 
percentage point decrease increase in annual costs discount rate expected long term rate of return increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate the approximate impact  as of april   of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate  holding other assumptions constant  on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which amends existing measurement guidance and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements  particularly for level as defined in the accounting guidance inputs 
this guidance will be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of level and level as defined in the accounting guidance fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
this guidance was effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal  
table of contents except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this guidance was effective in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge
