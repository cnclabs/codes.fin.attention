idaho power holds franchises  typically in the form of right of way arrangements  in cities in idaho and nine cities in oregon and holds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities to serve all or a portion of counties in idaho and three counties in oregon 
as of december   idaho power supplied electric energy to approximately  general business customers 
idaho power s principal commercial and industrial customers are involved in food processing  electronics and general manufacturing  agriculture  forest products  beet sugar refining  and winter recreation 
weather  customer demand  and economic conditions impact electricity sales and  therefore  utility revenues are not generated  and associated expenses are not incurred  evenly during the year 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
increased precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season reduce electricity sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
idaho power s retail energy sales typically peak during the summer irrigation and cooling season  with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand 
electric utilities have historically been recognized as natural monopolies and have operated in a highly regulated environment in which they have an obligation to provide electric service to their customers in return for an exclusive franchise within their service territory with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return 
idaho power is under the retail jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting  and other general matters of utility operation of the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc  and as a regulated electric utility idaho power is generally not subject to retail competition 
idaho power is also under the jurisdiction of the ipuc  the opuc  and the public service commission of wyoming as to the issuance of debt and equity securities 
rates and revenues retail idaho power periodically evaluates the need to seek changes to its retail electricity price structure to sufficiently cover its operating costs and provide a reasonable rate of return 
idaho power uses general rate cases  power cost adjustment pca mechanisms  a fixed cost adjustment fca mechanism  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on investment 
retail prices are determined through formal ratemaking proceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties  data requests  public hearings  and the issuance of a final order 
participants in such proceedings  which are conducted under established procedural schedules  include idaho power  the ipuc or 
tableofcontents opuc  and intervenors 
the ipuc and opuc are required to ensure that the prices and terms of service are fair  non discriminatory  and provide the company an opportunity to earn a fair return on investment 
in addition to general rate case filings  ratemaking proceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs  programs  or activities  as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recorded pursuant to specific authorization from the ipuc or opuc 
such amounts are generally collected from  or refunded to  retail customers through the use of supplemental tariffs

developments with special customer electric service agreements idaho power is authorized to enter into special electric service arrangements with customers who have an aggregate power requirement that exceeds mw 
notable recent developments with respect to two of those arrangements are described below 
micron on february   the ipuc approved a replacement electric service agreement between idaho power and micron technology  inc micron that provided operating and planning benefits to idaho power while allowing micron to reduce its contract demand to mw 
the prior agreement provided for a contract demand of mw 
hoku in march  the ipuc approved a september electric service agreement between idaho power and hoku materials  inc hoku  to provide electric service to hoku s polysilicon production facility being constructed in pocatello  idaho 
the initial term of the agreement was four years beginning june   subsequently changed to december   with a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of mw 
hoku was still not taking significant service as of december   and idaho power agreed to temporarily waive the minimum billed energy charge in the hoku special contract  effective december  the temporary waiver  which was approved by the ipuc  remains in effect until the month the contract load factor first exceeds percent of the total contract demand  or march   whichever comes first 
while the substantial delay in the starting date for hoku s energy purchases under the electric service agreement reduces idaho power s expected revenues  the revenue reductions are largely offset by corresponding reductions in idaho power s costs of providing service to hoku 
wholesale as a public utility under part ii of the federal power act fpa  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power s oatt is revised each year based on financial and operational data idaho power files annually with the ferc in its form the energy policy act of granted the ferc increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and reliability standards  as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets  including protection against market manipulation 
such standards  which are applicable to idaho power  were developed by the north american electric reliability corporation and the western electricity coordinating council wecc  which has responsibility for compliance and enforcement of these standards 
idaho power has one firm wholesale power sales contract  with raft river electric cooperative  for up to mw 
this contract expires in september idaho power has one wholesale reserve sales contract  with united materials of great falls  inc the agreement requires idaho power to carry energy reserves in association with an energy sales agreement between idaho power and united materials from the horseshoe bend wind farm located in montana 
the term of the agreement runs seasonally through may idaho power participates in the wholesale energy market by buying power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands 
idaho power market activities are guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans and are influenced by customer load  market prices  generating costs  and availability of generating resources 
some of idaho power hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run hydroelectric generation units and when to store water in reservoirs 
these decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales 
even in below normal water years  there are opportunities 
tableofcontents to vary water usage to maximize generation unit efficiency  capture marketplace economic benefits  and meet load demand 
wholesale energy market prices and compliance factors  such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements  influence these dispatch decisions 
energy sales the table below presents idaho power s revenues and energy use by customer type for the last three years 
approximately percent of idaho power s general business revenue comes from customers located in idaho  with the remainder coming from customers located in oregon 
idaho power s operations are discussed further in part ii  item md a results of operations utility operations 
years ended december  revenues thousands of dollars residential commercial industrial irrigation deferred revenue related to hells canyon relicensing afudc total general business off system sales other total energy use thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total general business off system sales total power supply idaho power primarily relies on company owned hydroelectric  coal  and gas fired generation facilities and long term power purchase agreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers 
idaho power s annual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in the snake river and market purchases and sales are used to balance supply and demand throughout the year 
idaho power s generating plants and their capacities are listed in part i  item properties 
weather  customer growth  and economic conditions impact power supply costs 
drought conditions and customer growth cause a greater reliance on more expensive purchased power to meet load requirements 
conversely  favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at idaho power s hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need for purchased power 
economic conditions can affect the market price of natural gas and coal  which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on june   and the all time winter peak demand is  mw  set on december  during these and other similarly heavy load periods idaho power s system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operating reserves 

tableofcontents the following table presents idaho power s total power supply for the last three years mwh percent of total generation thousands of mwh hydroelectric plants coal fired plants natural gas fired plants total system generation purchased power cogeneration and small power production purchased power other total purchased power total power supply hydroelectric generation idaho power operates hydroelectric projects located on the snake river and its tributaries 
together  these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of  mw and annual generation equal to approximately million megawatt hours mwh under median water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall  amount and timing of water leases  and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into idaho power s hydroelectric projects are reduced  idaho power s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
the manner in which idaho power has historically optimized operation of its hydroelectric facilities may change in the future as the company is faced with integrating an increasing amount of intermittent wind generation 
as additional intermittent wind generation resources are developed in the region and contracted to idaho power  the operational impacts will likely increase 
for related information on intermittent wind generation see purchased power agreements below 
stream flow conditions were below average in  resulting in a decrease of million mwh generated from idaho power s hydroelectric facilities compared to the observed stream flow data released in august by the us army corps of engineers indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of the national weather service northwest river forecast center nwrfc average  compared to maf  or percent  of the nwrfc average in power generation at the idaho power hydroelectric power plants on the snake river also depends on the state water rights held by idaho power and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows  and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
idaho power continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at idaho power s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
for more information on water management issues see part ii  item md a legal matters snake river basin water rights 
idaho power is subject to the provisions of the fpa as a public utility and as a licensee and is subject to regulation by the ferc 
as a licensee under part i of the fpa  idaho power and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions described in the fpa and related ferc regulations 
these conditions and regulations include provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation  amortization of project investment from excess project earnings  possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment  severance damages  and other matters 

tableofcontents idaho power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc  similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways 
the licensing process includes an extensive public review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmental issues 
the licenses last to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex and swan falls projects 
for further information on relicensing activities see part ii  item md a relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
the state of oregon has a hydroelectric act providing for licensing of hydroelectric projects in that state 
idaho power s brownlee  oxbow  and hells canyon facilities are subject to the oregon hydroelectric act 
idaho power has obtained oregon licenses for these facilities 
coal and natural gas fired generation idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas fired combustion turbine power plants 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger located in wyoming  boardman located in oregon  and valmy located in nevada 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the langley gulch natural gas fired combined cycle power plant located in idaho is currently under construction and is contracted to achieve commercial operation by november  based on contract incentives and the current project status  idaho power estimates that the plant will be in service by june fuel supply coal idaho power  through its subsidiary ierco  owns a one third interest in bcc  which owns the jim bridger mine that supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant one third owned by idaho power 
the mine  located near the jim bridger plant  operates under a long term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal over a year period ending in from surface  high wall  and underground sources 
idaho power believes that the jim bridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for the term of the sales agreement 
idaho power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through from the black butte coal company s black butte and leucite hills mines located near the jim bridger plant 
this contract supplements the bridger coal deliveries and provides another coal supply to operate the jim bridger plant 
the jim bridger plant s rail load in facility and unit coal train provide the opportunity to access other fuel supplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums 
nv energy  inc  as the operator of the valmy generating plant  has an agreement with arch coal sales company  inc to supply coal to the plant through  however  due to force majeure provisions of the contract  approximately  tons idaho power portion will be delivered to the valmy plant in instead of as a percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase one half of the coal  ranging from  tons to  tons annually 
nv energy  inc also has a coal supply contract with black butte coal company s black butte mine for deliveries through idaho power is obligated to purchase one half of the coal purchased under this agreement ranging from as low as  to as high as  tons annually 
the boardman generating plant receives coal from the powder river basin through annual contracts 
portland general electric company  as the operator of the boardman plant  has two agreements with alpha natural resources  inc  to supply all of the boardman plant s coal requirements in as a ten percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase ten percent of the coal purchased under these agreements  which is  tons in including approximately  tons provided by force majeure contract provisions from 
a request for proposal rfp for the coal supply is planned in fuel supply natural gas idaho power owns and operates the danskin and bennett mountain combustion turbines 
natural gas is purchased based on system requirements 
the natural gas is supplied through northwest pipeline gp s northwest pipeline under a  million british thermal units mmbtu per day long term gas transportation service agreement 
the agreement runs into  with extensions at idaho power s discretion 
in addition to the long term gas transportation service agreement  idaho power has entered into a long term storage service agreement with northwest for  mmbtu of total storage capacity at the jackson prairie storage project 
as the project is developed  storage capacity will be phased into service and allocated to idaho power on a monthly basis 
idaho power current storage allotment is approximately percent of its total  and its full allotment is expected to be reached by march the firm storage 
tableofcontents contract expires in natural gas will be purchased and stored with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for summer peaks or to meet system requirements 
procurement of gas for the langley gulch combined cycle natural gas fired power plant will be managed to meet system requirements and fueling strategies 
natural gas for langley gulch will be supplied through multiple northwest long term gas transportation service agreements totaling  mmbtu per day with a range of start dates beginning march and a range of end dates through may idaho power has sole discretion regarding extensions to the multiple long term service agreements 
purchased power agreements idaho power purchases power in the market  based on economics  operating reserve margins  risk limits  and unit availability  and from purpa projects as mandated 
idaho power seeks to manage its loads efficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long term purchase power contracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the market 
idaho power has the following firm wholesale purchased power contracts and energy exchange agreements ppl energy plus  llc for mw per hour during heavy load hours  to address increased demand during june  july and august 
the contract term is through august  raft river energy i  llc for mw nameplate generation from its raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho 
the contract term is through april  telocaset wind power partners  llc for mw nameplate generation from its elkhorn valley wind project located in eastern oregon 
the contract term is through  usg oregon llc for mw estimated average annual output from the to be constructed neal hot springs geothermal power plant located near vale  oregon 
the contract term is years with an option to extend 
commercial operation is expected in late  clatskanie people s utility for the exchange of up to mw of energy from the arrowrock project in southern idaho for energy from idaho power s system or power purchased at the mid columbia trading hub 
the initial term of the agreement is january  through december  idaho power has the right to renew the agreement for two additional five year terms  and nv energy  inc for the exchange of up to mw of energy hourly 
the agreement expires march  pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the state regulatory commissions have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power s purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production cspp facilities 
a key component of the purpa contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
the purpa regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility s avoided costs 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and opuc to estimate idaho power s cost of developing additional generation resources 
the ipuc and opuc have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the published avoided cost that idaho power is required to include in purpa contracts 
idaho power has contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
for these contracts idaho power is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service territory  subject to some exceptions such as adverse impacts on system reliability  idaho power is required to purchase the output of projects located outside its service territory if it has the ability to receive power at the facility s requested point of delivery on the idaho power system  the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the pca  the opuc jurisdictional portion is recovered through general rate case filings and the oregon pca mechanism  for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy monthly are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the ipuc has granted a temporary reduction in the upper eligibility limit to kilowatts kw for wind and solar projects  as discussed below  for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term  and 
tableofcontents if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  idaho power is required to negotiate the terms  prices  and conditions with the developer 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location  and size and the benefits to the idaho power system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
published avoided cost rates remain relatively high  providing a favorable climate for purpa project development  which may result in idaho power acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices when a surplus already exists and may also require additional integration costs  thus increasing costs to its customers 
in response to a november  application filed by idaho power and two other electric utilities with idaho service territories  on february   the ipuc issued an order temporarily reducing the eligibility cap  effective retroactively to december   to kw for wind and solar purpa projects only  while the ipuc further investigates the implications of large projects disaggregating into smaller projects to qualify for higher published avoided cost rates  tax incentives  and other benefits 
as of december   idaho power had the following signed cspp related agreements originally ranging from one to years 
the majority of the new facilities will be wind resources which will generate on an intermittent basis 
of nameplate status contracts capacity mw on line at the end of projected to come on line by year end total during  idaho power purchased  mwh of power from cspp facilities at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of per mwh 
transmission services electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers 
transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generation facilities can be located anywhere from a few miles to hundreds of miles from customers 
idaho power s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum load carrying capability and reliability 
idaho power s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration bpa  avista corporation  pacificorp  northwestern energy  and nv energy  inc these interconnections  coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities  permit the interchange  purchase  and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnecting with the winter peaking northern and summer peaking southern regions of the western power system 
idaho power provides wholesale transmission service and provides firm and non firm wheeling services for eligible transmission customers 
idaho power is a member of the wecc  the western systems power pool  the northwest power pool  the northern tier transmission group  and the north american energy standards board 
these groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the western grid 
resource planning and renewable energy projects idaho power filed its integrated resource plan irp with the ipuc and opuc in december the irp forecasts idaho power s load and resource situation for the next years  analyzes potential supply side and demand side options  and identifies near term and long term actions 
the irp was accepted by the ipuc in august and acknowledged by the opuc in october the four primary goals of the irp are to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within idaho power s service area throughout the year planning period  ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost  risk  and environmental concerns  
tableofcontents give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  and involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
idaho power updates the irp every two years and work on the irp began in the summer of the updated plan is expected to be completed and filed in june during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
idaho power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development  and regulatory requirements 
the irp identified the mw langley gulch project currently under construction and a mw expansion of the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility that is currently being evaluated for economic viability 
idaho power is also planning the boardman to hemingway and the gateway west transmission lines and has constructed the hemingway substation  all of which are intended to improve reliability  relieve congestion  and provide system flexibility 
refer to part ii  item md a liquidity and capital resources capital requirements major projects for additional information about idaho power s significant infrastructure development projects and plan 
the irp also included discussion related to the following resources geothermal rfps although the results of previously conducted geothermal rfp processes have been disappointing  idaho power continues to work with project developers capable of delivering energy to the company s service area 
the irp included two mw increments of geothermal energy in the preferred portfolio  one in and one in the mw increment in was addressed by a long term power purchase agreement for the output from the neal hot springs geothermal project located in eastern oregon 
the need for the additional increment of geothermal energy is being assessed in the irp 
wind rfp in may  idaho power issued an rfp seeking to purchase up to mw of wind generation by the rfp generated considerable interest from wind developers  and throughout the first half of  idaho power negotiated with the front runner 
during this time  other project developers began expressing an interest in developing wind projects under purpa and it became evident the additional wind generation under purpa would exceed the mw identified in the rfp 
due to the acquisition of this additional purpa wind generation and due to stalled contract negotiations in the rfp process  idaho power did not award a contract under the rfp process and concluded the rfp process in august combined heat and power chp rfp chp resources were not included in the irp preferred portfolio because of the uncertainty in being able to successfully develop a chp project 
however  idaho power continues to work with large customers and other parties to explore chp development opportunities 
in  idaho power signed an agreement to jointly investigate a chp project with the idaho office of energy resources ioer and the amalgamated sugar company tasco  one of idaho power s large industrial customers 
the agreement established the framework for a high level feasibility study to investigate installing a chp project at tasco s nampa  idaho facility that could be as large as mw 
the ioer and idaho power jointly funded the study 
the high level feasibility study confirmed initial estimates of the project s potential benefits  and in september  idaho power  ioer  and tasco entered into a second agreement to complete a more detailed feasibility study to refine performance and financial modeling of the proposed project 
an rfp was issued and a consulting firm was selected to perform the more detailed feasibility study 
the study is expected to be completed by the second quarter of energy efficiency and demand side management programs in  idaho power s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately  mwh  and the demand response programs resulted in a summer peak demand reduction of about mw through combined program performance 

tableofcontents in  idaho power spent approximately million on energy efficiency and targeted demand reduction response programs 
approximately million of funding for these programs is funded by idaho and oregon energy efficiency tariff riders while the balance of the funding comes from idaho power base rates 
idaho power has energy efficiency and demand response programs in place  targeting savings across the entire year and summer system demand reduction 
these programs are offered to all customer segments and emphasize the wise use of energy  especially during periods of high demand 
this energy and demand reduction can minimize or delay the need for new infrastructure 
idaho power s programs include financial incentives for irrigation customers for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energy efficient systems  energy efficiency for new and existing homes  including efficient appliances and hvac equipment  energy efficient building techniques  insulation improvement  air duct sealing  and energy efficient lighting  incentives to industrial and commercial customers for using energy efficient equipment  and using energy efficiency techniques and operational and management processes  and demand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through the voluntary interruption of central air conditioners for residential customers  interruption of irrigation pumps  and reduction of commercial and industrial demand through a third party demand response aggregator 
approximately million of idaho power s energy efficiency spending was related to research and analysis  education  technology evaluation  and market transformation 
most of this activity was done in conjunction with the northwest energy efficiency alliance neea 
environmental regulation idaho power is subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional  and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore  and enhance the quality of the environment including air  water  and solid waste 
current and pending legislation relates to  among other items  climate change  greenhouse gas emissions and air quality  renewable energy standards res  mercury and other emissions  hazardous wastes  and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
environmental laws and regulations may  among other things  increase the cost of operating power generation plants and constructing new facilities  require that idaho power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants  or require that idaho power discontinue operating certain power generation plants 
environmental regulation continues to impact idaho power s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with such regulations  and the modification of system operations to accommodate such regulations 
in addition to generally applicable regulations  the ferc licenses issued for idaho power s hydroelectric generating plants have environmental requirements such as aeration of turbine water to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
idaho power monitors these issues and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
further  idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants that are subject to a broad range of environmental requirements  including air quality regulation 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues  refer to part ii  item md a environmental issues 

tableofcontents idaho power s environmental compliance costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future  especially with potential additional regulation under discussion at the state and federal level 
idaho power estimates its environmental expenditures  based upon present environmental laws and regulations  will be as follows for the periods indicated  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc in millions of dollars environmental expenditures studies and measures at hydroelectric facilities investments in equipment and facilities at thermal plants total capital expenditures operating costs for environmental facilities hydroelectric operating costs for environmental facilities thermal total operations and maintenance idaho power anticipates that a number of impending epa rulemakings and proceedings addressing  among other things  ozone and fine particulate matter pollution  emissions  and disposal of coal combustion residuals could result in substantially increased operating and compliance costs

tableofcontents item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the risk factors set forth below may have a significant impact on the business  financial condition  or results of operations of idacorp  inc and idaho power company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission  or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than idaho power company needs to cover existing and future increased costs of providing services  earnings and cash flows may be reduced 
the prices that the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission authorize idaho power company to charge for its retail services  and the tariff rate that the federal energy regulatory commission permits idaho power company to charge for transmission  are the most significant factors influencing idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred  and the formula rates allowed by the federal energy regulatory commission may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred 
while the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission have established through the ratemaking process an authorized rate of return for idaho power company  the regulatory process does not provide assurance that idaho power company will be able to achieve the earnings level authorized 
further  while the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission are required to establish rates that are fair  just  and reasonable  they have significant discretion in applying this standard 
the ratemaking process typically involves multiple parties  including governmental bodies  consumer advocacy groups  and various consumers of energy  each party has differing concerns but have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates 
idaho power company cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any ratemaking proceedings  including the extent to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed 
in january  the idaho public utilities commission approved a settlement agreement that imposed a general rate moratorium in effect in the idaho jurisdiction until january  while the moratorium does not apply to other specified revenue requirement proceedings  such as the power cost adjustment  the fixed cost adjustment  pension funding  advanced metering infrastructure  energy efficiency rider  and government imposed fees  idaho power company attempts to manage its costs consistent with the moratorium 
however  if idaho power company is unable to do so  or if such cost management results in increased operational risk  the moratorium could adversely affect idaho power company s operations or results of operations 
idaho power company has power cost adjustment mechanisms that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho and oregon retail customers 
the power cost adjustment tracks idaho power company s actual net power supply costs primarily fuel and purchased power less off system sales and compares these amounts to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates 
a majority  but not all  of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from or refund to customers 
accordingly  the power cost adjustment mechanism only partially offsets the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages  severe weather  reduced hydroelectric generating availability  and volatile wholesale energy prices 
because of the power cost adjustment mechanism  the primary financial impact of power supply cost variations is on the timing of cash flows 
when costs rise above the level recovered in retail rates it adversely affects idaho power company s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers 

tableofcontents reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of idaho power company s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  the availability of water can significantly affect its operations 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power company must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power and opportunities for off system sales are reduced  which reduces revenues 
in addition  while idaho power company can expect to recover  as a result of its power cost adjustment mechanisms  the majority of its net power supply costs above the level included in its rates  recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year 
continuing declines in stream flows and over appropriation of water in idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water  and drought conditions have led to disputes among surface water and ground water irrigators  and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake plain aquifer  which contributes to snake river flows  by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer  is one proposed solution to the dispute 
diversions from the snake river for aquifer recharge may further reduce snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and reduce idaho power company s revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company s january settlement agreement with the state of idaho resolves litigation regarding certain idaho power company water rights on the snake river and provides for ongoing snake river water issues to be addressed in a comprehensive aquifer management plan process 
however  there is no assurance that this process will lead to increased snake river stream flows for idaho power company s hydroelectric projects 
idaho power company also has initiated legal action against the us bureau of reclamation over the interpretation and effect of a contract with the us bureau of reclamation on the operation of the american falls reservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at idaho power company s downstream hydroelectric projects 
the comprehensive aquifer management plan process and the resolution of the litigation may affect snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce idaho power company s revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs and reduced earnings 
in addition to hydroelectric generation  idaho power company relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
increases in market prices for coal and natural gas can result in reduced earnings 
increases in demand for natural gas may result in market price increases  short term price volatility  and supply availability issues 
operation of the langley gulch power plant that idaho power company is currently constructing will increase idaho power company s demand for natural gas  and thus its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
in addition  delivery of coal and natural gas depends upon gas pipelines  rail lines  rail cars  and roadways 
any disruption in idaho power company s fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs  to produce power from higher cost generation facilities  or to purchase power from other sources at higher costs  which may adversely impact earnings 
idaho power company s power generating facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry 
operating risks associated with hydroelectric  natural gas  coal  and other generation facilities include equipment failures  volatility in fuel and transportation pricing  interruptions in fuel supplies  regulatory compliance obligations and costs  labor disputes  workforce safety matters  and catastrophic events at the facilities 
these operational risks may result in plant outages  as well as increased operation and maintenance expenses  power generation costs  and power purchase costs 
load growth in idaho power company s service territory exposes it to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
while idaho power company s customer growth rate has slowed in recent years  increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet that demand 
while idaho power company can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the amounts included in its rates  recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year  and the remaining amount is absorbed by idaho power company  which could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
load growth can result in the need for additional investments in idaho power company s infrastructure to serve the new load 
for instance  to meet customer demand idaho power company is currently constructing its langley gulch natural gas fired generating plant  and has in development a number of transmission projects 
if idaho power company was unable to secure timely rate relief from the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission  or the federal energy regulatory commission to recover the costs of these additional investments  the resulting disconnect between the time expenditures are made and costs are recovered would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows 
load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for idaho power company that can negatively impact its ability to reliably serve customers 
weather and climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation and disrupt transmission and distribution systems  reducing earnings and cash flows 
warmer than normal winters  cooler than normal summers  and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons will reduce retail revenues from power sales and may impact the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather 
tableofcontents events can disrupt transmission and distribution systems and cause service interruptions and extended outages  increase supply chain costs  and potentially interrupt use of generation resources and limit the ability to meet customer demand 
disruption in transmission and distribution systems increases operations and maintenance expenses and reduces earnings and cash flows 
in addition  long term climate change could affect idaho power company s business in a variety of ways  including changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand  extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  and maintenance costs  changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation  legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations  including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources and the expansion of existing resources  result in closure of generation resources or installation of costly pollution control equipment  or require changes to the operation of generation resources in general  and consumer preference for  and resource planning decisions requiring  renewable or low greenhouse gas emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources 
any of these effects of climate change could decrease revenues  increase operating costs  and reduce idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company s risk management policy and programs relating to hedging power and gas exposures and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended  and as a result idaho power company may suffer economic losses 
idaho power company is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe it money will default on their obligations 
a similar risk of non performance by third parties arises where those parties are obligated to purchase energy from  or sell energy to  idaho power company  or are parties to commodity price risk management arrangements 
idaho power company actively manages the market risk inherent in its energy related activities and counterparty credit positions 
idaho power company has procedures that monitor compliance with its risk management policies and programs  including verification of transactions  regular portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics  and daily counterparty credit risk analysis 
however  actual hydroelectric and thermal generation  transmission availability  and market prices may be significantly different than those originally planned for when idaho power company enters into its hedging transactions positions 
the high volatility of these items creates uncertainty in the appropriate amount of hedging activity to pursue 
forecasts of future loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause idaho power company to over or under hedge actual resource needs  exposing the company to market risk on the over or under hedged position 
changes in market prices are also unpredictable and can at times result in idaho power company s hedged positions performing less favorably than unhedged positions 
in addition  idaho power company s counterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties from failing to perform  forcing the company to replace forward contracts with transactions in the open market 
as a result  risk management decisions may have significant impacts if actual events result in greater losses or costs in delivering energy to customers and could negatively affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
increased capital expenditures for power generation and delivery infrastructure development and replacement can significantly affect liquidity 
idaho power company s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation and in other infrastructure projects 
increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution systems  generating facilities  and other infrastructure 
the cost of maintaining existing  aging equipment and infrastructure and developing new infrastructure is substantial  and involves risks relating to  among other things  cost overruns  unscheduled outages  price increases in commodities such as steel and copper and other materials necessary for developing infrastructure  and denial of regulatory recovery 
if idaho power company does not receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities or other capital projects  idaho power company will have to rely more heavily on external financing for its future utility construction expenditures 
these large planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power company s facilities were constructed many years ago  which could affect reliability and increase maintenance costs 
failure of equipment or facilities used in idaho power company s system could potentially increase repair and maintenance expenses  purchased power expenses  and capital expenditures 
the performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could adversely impact cash flow and liquidity 
idaho power company provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan consisting of health care and death benefits that covers eligible retirees 
costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and  therefore  adverse investment performance for these assets could increase idaho power company s funding requirements related to the plans 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates  and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and the availability of recovery of costs through rates  cash contributions to the plans could impact idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s cash flow and liquidity 
complying with existing and future environmental laws and regulations will increase capital expenditures and operating costs and may reduce idaho power company s earnings and cash flows and ability to meet the electricity needs of its customers 
idaho power company is subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental statutes  rules  and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources  and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules  and regulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures 
members of congress have proposed legislation to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and the environmental protection agency is taking action to address climate change and regulate greenhouse gas emissions  including the adoption of new reporting requirements that apply to idaho power company s facilities 
the environmental protection agency has also made an endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and has indicated that the clean air act will require it to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary sources  including idaho power company s thermal facilities  once it adopts greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles 
the adoption of a mandatory federal program or state programs to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
mercury and other pollutant emissions from idaho power company s thermal facilities are also subject to extensive regulation 
the adoption of new statutes  rules  and regulations to reduce emissions  including controls to reduce carbon dioxide  greenhouse gas  mercury  or other pollutant emissions will result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost of operating coal fired generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate and result in reduced earnings and cash flows 
complying with state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
a number of states have adopted renewable energy portfolio standards 
idaho power company s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfolio standard beginning in  and it is possible that other states could adopt renewable energy portfolio standards that are applicable to idaho power in the future 
new state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
the listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act of fish  wildlife  or plant species that are found in the areas of idaho power company s generation facilities or transmission lines may require mitigation  affect the location of a project or the ability to construct a project  and result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
relicensing of the hells canyon and swan falls hydroelectric projects and the construction of the langley gulch power plant and the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines require consultation under the endangered species act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas 
the recent listing of 
tableofcontents slickspot peppergrass as a threatened species will require an endangered species act consultation for the transmission and water lines for langley gulch as well as for the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines  and future transmission projects 
similarly  the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of idaho power s boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission line projects has required more extensive  costly  and time consuming evaluation and engineering 
the impact of the endangered species act  including the potential listing of additional fish  wildlife  or plant species  and similar laws may require mitigation  cause a delay in relicensing or construction of projects  affect the location or ability to construct a project  increase the costs of construction and operations  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures  increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric production  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for some of its hydroelectric projects  including its largest hydroelectric generation source  the hells canyon complex 
relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions 
the listing of various species of marine life  wildlife  and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally authorized activities  including those of hydroelectric projects 
salmon and other marine life recovery plans could include further major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects 
in addition  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to such facilities  which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet idaho power company s energy requirements 
in  the federal energy regulatory commission staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the hells canyon complex  which the federal energy regulatory commission will use in part to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the hells canyon complex 
certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act and formal consultations under the endangered species act  which remain unresolved 
one significant issue involves water temperature gradients  and certain parties in the hells canyon complex relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which  if required to be installed  would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain 
there can be no assurance that recovery through rates would be authorized  particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates  which at this time cannot be accurately predicted 
idaho power company also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process  the economic impact of those requirements  or whether a new multi year license will ultimately be issued 
imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in idaho power incurring significant capital expenditures  increase operating costs  and reduce hydroelectric generation  which could reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by increased costs resulting from  or liability under  existing or future regulations or requirements 
idaho power company is subject to extensive federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and regulatory audits  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission  the environmental protection agency  the north american electric reliability corporation  the western electricity coordinating council  and the public utility commissions in idaho  oregon  and wyoming 
some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation  and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences 
idaho power company has self reported compliance issues to the federal energy regulatory commission and to the western electricity coordinating council 
several of the matters self reported to the federal energy regulatory commission and the western electricity coordinating council remain outstanding 
compliance with these requirements directly influences idaho power company s operating environment and may significantly increase idaho power company s operating costs 
further  potential monetary and non monetary penalties for a violation of federal energy regulatory commission regulations may be substantial  and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as million per day per violation 
the imposition of penalties on idaho power company could have an adverse impact on its and idacorp  inc s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 

tableofcontents idacorp  inc  its subsidiary idacorp energy  and idaho power company are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  settlements  investigations  and claims 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy  and idaho power company are involved in a number of proceedings  including the california refund proceeding  a portion of which remains pending before the federal energy regulatory commission and the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the pacific northwest  and show cause proceedings originating at the federal energy regulatory commission  a portion of which remains pending in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
it is possible that additional proceedings related to the western energy situation may be filed in the future against idacorp  inc  idacorp energy  or idaho power company 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are or may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims  actions  and complaints  including those related to the jim bridger  valmy  and boardman coal fired plants  in which idaho power company holds an ownership interest 
for instance  in september  the environmental protection agency issued a notice of violation to portland general electric company  the majority owner of the boardman plant  alleging that portland general electric company had violated the new source performance standards and operating permit requirements under the clean air act  as a result of modifications made to the plant in and state attorneys general have brought actions against companies seeking additional disclosure of climate change related risks and impacts  and private parties have brought tort actions against companies relating to their alleged contribution to climate change 
if idacorp  inc  idacorp energy  or idaho power company are required to make payments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding  settlement  investigation  or claim  earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 
as a holding company  idacorp  inc does not have its own operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments 
idacorp  inc is a holding company with no significant operations of its own  and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power company 
consequently  idacorp  inc s ability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries 
idacorp  inc s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to idacorp  inc  whether through dividends  loans  or other payments 
the ability of idacorp  inc s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to idacorp  inc depends on several factors  including each subsidiaries actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition  regulatory restrictions  and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities 
a downgrade in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability to access capital  increase their cost of borrowing  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
idacorp  inc 
and idaho power company also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper 
downgrades of idacorp  inc s or idaho power company s credit ratings  or those affecting relationship banks  could limit the companies ability to access capital  including the commercial paper markets  require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
volatility in the financial markets may negatively affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s ability to access capital and or increase their cost of borrowing  or result in losses on investments 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of and interest on debt and to finance capital expenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption  generally resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers 
in a volatile credit environment  one or more of the participating banks in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under  or withdraw from  the credit facilities  or idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited 
in addition  at times idaho power company has a relatively large balance of short term investments  particularly during times when it has issued debt or equity securities to fund future debt maturities not yet due and capital expenditure requirements payable over time 
volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short term investments and declines in value of some investments 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s earnings  liquidity  and financial condition 

tableofcontents national and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts  which would reduce earnings and cash flows 
recent concerns over energy costs  the availability and cost of credit  declining business  and high rates of unemployment contributed to a recent recession 
these factors have resulted  and may continue to result  in an increase in late payments and uncollectible accounts  which reduce idacorp inc s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
national and regional economic conditions  in conjunction with increased electric rates  may reduce energy consumption  which may reduce revenues and future growth 
beginning in  economic conditions in idaho power company s service area have been relatively weak 
unemployment rates are high relative to historic unemployment levels and customer growth has been slow relative to prior years 
the recent recession and increased rates may reduce the amount of energy idaho power company s customers consume  result in a loss of customers  and reduce the customer growth rate 
a decrease in overall customer usage may reduce revenues  earnings  and future growth 
changes in tax laws and regulations  or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions  could have a material adverse impact on idacorp  inc s or idaho power company s financial condition 
idacorp  inc 
and idaho power company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes 
the companies tax obligations include income  real estate  public utility  municipal  sales and use  business and occupation  and employment related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes 
these judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities 
for instance  in september  idaho power company adopted a tax accounting method change for repair related expenditures on utility assets concurrent with the filing of idacorp  inc s consolidated federal income tax return 
also in the third quarter of  idaho power company reached an agreement with the internal revenue service  subject to subsequent review by the us congress joint committee on taxation  regarding the allocation of mixed service costs in its method of uniform capitalization 
the outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings such as these could differ materially from the amounts currently recorded  and the difference could reduce idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
further  in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any benefits from tax related projects  or the reversal of reserves recorded by idacorp  inc or idaho power company for tax related matters such as those described above  could be different than idacorp  inc or idaho power company currently anticipate or in the future request from the regulatory bodies 
the idaho public utilities commission or oregon public utility commission could  for instance  determine that all or a portion of any benefits resulting from tax related projects be shared with customers in the form of reduced rates or otherwise  which may reduce revenue  earnings  and cash flows 
employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduce earnings 
idaho power company is subject to workforce factors  including  but not limited to  loss or retirement of key personnel  availability of qualified personnel  an aging workforce  and impacts of efforts to organize workforce  including the possible unionization of one or more segments of the workforce 
idaho power company s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized  complex utility functions 
idaho power company expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring within the coming decade  which places demand on idaho power company to attract and retain skilled workers 
without a skilled workforce  idaho power company s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenged and could affect earnings 
also  the costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows 
terrorist threats and activities could result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
idaho power company s generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist threats and activities 
the possibility that infrastructure facilities  such as fossil and hydroelectric generation facilities and electric transmission and distribution facilities  would be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror may affect idaho power company s operations 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism  war  and similar actions may also affect idaho power company s results of operations and its ability to raise capital 
further  the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliance costs 

tableofcontents idacorp  inc and idaho power company could be vulnerable to security breaches or other similar events that could disrupt their operations  require significant capital expenditures  and or result in claims against the companies 
in the normal course of business  idaho power company collects  processes  and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information  and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid 
despite the security measures in place  idaho power company s facilities and systems  and those of third party service providers  could be vulnerable to security breaches or other similar events that could interrupt operations  resulting in a shutdown of service and expose idaho power company to liability 
in addition  idaho power company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches 
idaho power company s ability to enter into over the counter derivatives and hedge commodity and interest rate risk may be adversely affected by recent federal legislation 
in july  congress enacted  and president obama signed  financial reform legislation known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
title vii of the legislation provides for the regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  and requires the posting of cash collateral for uncleared swaps 
if the rules enacted under the legislation require that idaho power company post cash collateral on its swap or derivative transactions  its liquidity may be adversely affected  and rules promulgated under the legislation may impair idaho power company s ability to enter into over the counter derivatives to hedge commodity and interest rate risks
