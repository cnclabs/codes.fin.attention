item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused on south america  with operations in argentina and colombia 
as of december   we had interests in eight oil and gas producing concessions and two exploration permits in argentina  and three exploration and production contracts in colombia 
we have experienced gradual improvements in the economic environment for argentina s hydrocarbons industry since the second half of and throughout product prices have continued to trend modestly upward during this period 
with improved product prices  recently added investments and business development opportunities  our business plan for was structured around growing our presence in the neuqu n basin  completing the initial phases of our exploration projects in colombia and continued development in our core properties 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  and we spent an additional million for the acquisition of seismic information in both argentina and colombia 
highlights for include the following increased total consolidated and equity sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis by four percent  successful development and exploration drilling campaigns in our core neuqu n basin properties  exploration discovery in the agua amarga exploration permit  exploration discoveries in the coir n amargo exploration permit  and awarded an exploration block in colombia 
for  net income attributable to apco oil and gas international inc was million compared with million for higher average sales prices and greater equity income from argentine investment in led to the increase in net income compared with these favorable variances were partially offset by greater costs and operating expenses and higher income tax expense 
outlook for we expect oil prices in argentina to increase moderately in compared with year end prices of around per barrel 
after completing significant seismic exploration activities in  we plan to initiate exploration drilling activities in colombia  resulting in increased capital expenditures compared with we have the following expectations and objectives for obtain the ten year concession extensions for our properties in r o negro and tierra del fuego  continued development and exploration drilling in our core properties in our neuqu n basin properties  complete farm in drilling commitments in coir n amargo  initiate exploration activities in sur r o deseado este  commence exploration drilling in colombia and acquire d seismic data over block  and continue a disciplined approach toward seeking investment opportunities in south america 

table of contents our oil and gas capital expenditure budget is million net to our consolidated interests 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital budget for is million 
in addition  we plan on spending approximately million for the acquisition of seismic information

potential change in control williams separation plan on february   williams announced that its board of directors approved pursuing a plan to separate williams into two standalone  publicly traded corporations 
the plan calls for the separation of its exploration and production business via an initial public offering in of up to percent of a corporation holding that business new e p and  in  a spin off to williams shareholders of its remaining interest in new e p 
williams stated its intention to include its interest in apco in new e p 
williams retains the discretion to determine whether and when to execute the spinoff 
following the spinoff  apco would be majority owned by new e p company  a large scale  independent primarily north american diversified exploration and production company which would not be controlled by williams 
this proposed ownership change of williams could  among other things  affect our leadership and financing opportunities 
williams indicated that the completion and timing of the separation plan is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the macroeconomic environment  credit markets  equity markets  energy prices  the receipt of a tax opinion from counsel and or internal revenue service rulings  final approvals from williams board of directors  and other matters 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or that the transaction terms announced by williams will result in any changes to williams current structure 
overview of business development in  apco participated in a public bidding process known as anh miniround for the assignment of certain exploration properties by the government of colombia 
apco and ramshorn international limited ramshorn  a subsidiary of nabors drilling  were awarded the llanos block in the bidding round 
we will hold a percent working interest in the block and ramshorn will also hold percent and will be the operator 
the block will be governed by an exploration and production contract executed with the anh 
one of the requirements of the contract is to issue a letter of credit to guarantee the contract s work commitments 
we anticipate issuing a million letter of credit net to apco in the first quarter of and collateralizing it with cash 
the llanos block covers approximately  acres and is approximately kilometers to the northeast of the llanos block 
our three year first phase exploration work commitments will include seismic reprocessing  acquisition of square kilometers  or approximately  acres  of d seismic and the drilling of four exploration wells 
we anticipate spending between and million net to apco for these work commitments over a three year period and funding these activities from cash reserves and internally generated cash 
we expect exploration activities and expenditures to begin in 
table of contents neuqu n basin properties apco and its partners used two rigs throughout to drill gross development wells and one exploration well in the areas 
all wells but one were successful 
total gross capital expenditures was million for the year  or million net to our percent direct working interest and million attributable to our equity interest in petrolera 
we have a percent direct working interest and an effective percent equity interest in the wells mentioned above 
additional activities included production facility investments for gas compression and oil pipelines in the charco del palenque and bajada del palo concessions  and the acquisition of approximately square kilometers of d seismic information in the western portion of the bajada del palo concession for a cost of approximately million net to apco 
in our agua amarga exploration permit  we drilled the jarilla quemada x exploration well which resulted in a natural gas and condensate discovery 
the well was located in the eastern part of the block 
in december  we began drilling another exploration well on the meseta filosa prospect in the central part of the area 
coir n amargo in february  we entered into a farm in agreement that allows us to acquire  through a drill to earn structure  up to a percent net interest in the coir n amargo exploration permit in the neuqu n basin 
the coir n amargo block covers approximately  acres and is adjacent to our core properties in the basin 
under the agreement  apco earned a percent non operated interest for funding the drilling of two exploration wells during the first two wells were drilled in the third quarter and discovered oil and associated natural gas from the tordillo formation 
apco subsequently elected to proceed to a second phase and drill two additional wells to increase our interest to percent 
we spent approximately million during the first phase of this agreement in  and we anticipate spending an additional million for the drilling of two wells in austral northwest basin properties we re commenced development drilling in our tierra del fuego and acambuco concessions in early during the year  we drilled ten development gas wells in tierra del fuego  of which two were determined to be non productive and two are currently awaiting completion 
in acambuco  the macueta development well was drilled during and will be tested in concession contracts in argentina in the second half of  the provinces of r o negro and tierra del fuego approved basic frameworks for the negotiation of the year concession extensions provided by argentina s hydrocarbon law 
similar to the negotiations concluded with the province of neuqu n in  the requirements include the negotiation of a cash bonus payment  an increase to provincial production taxes  and a future expenditure program 
the concession terms for the portion of the entre lomas concession located in r o negro and for our tierra del fuego concessions currently end in the operators of the concessions are leading negotiations with the provinces on behalf of the joint venture partners 
we expect to conclude these negotiations in approximately one half of the entre lomas concession  including our largest producing field  is located in the province of r o negro 
in general  the depletion life of many of our proved wells extends beyond and through the end of the concession extension period  and consequently  obtaining the year extension should lead to reserve upgrades that will result in a material increase in the volume of proved reserves 

table of contents colombia in the llanos block in the llanos basin of western colombia  apco and its partners completed the acquisition of square kilometers  or  acres  of d seismic information 
we spent approximately million net to apco during for this program 
drilling prospects are being identified by the partners and we expect to drill two exploration wells on this block during recent exploration drilling results achieved by other companies drilling to the same sub surface formations that we will be targeting in the llanos basin have been encouraging 
in the turpial block  apco and its partner completed a program to extend seismic coverage in the northern area of the block with kilometers of d seismic information 
we spent approximately million net to apco during for this program 
we anticipate initiating exploration drilling on the block during oil and natural gas marketing oil prices oil prices have a significant impact on our ability to generate earnings  fund capital projects  and pay shareholder dividends 
oil prices are affected by changes in market demands  global economic activity  political events  weather  inventory storage levels  refinery infrastructure capacity  opec production quotas  and other factors 
additionally  oil sales price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions as described in the following paragraphs 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future prices  and therefore it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in product prices may have on our capital programs  production volumes  or future revenues 
historically  the price per barrel for argentine crude oil was based on the spot market price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti less a discount for differences in gravity and quality 
in the wake of the argentine economic crises of  and as the price of crude oil increased to record levels over the past several years  politically driven mechanisms were implemented to determine the sale price of oil produced and sold in argentina 
to alleviate the impact of higher crude oil prices on argentina s economy  the argentine government created an oil export tax and enacted strict price controls over gasoline prices to force producers and refiners to negotiate oil sales prices significantly below international market levels 
in response to those governmental actions  argentine producers and refiners had to negotiate domestic oil sale prices that take into consideration both net backs for oil exported from argentina and the cost of feedstock to refiners in light of gasoline price controls 
consequently  apco has not benefited from increases in world oil prices over the past several years as have producers outside of argentina 
the extreme volatility of world oil prices during recent years has not been reflected in our results of operations due to the price controls and marketing environment in argentina 
our oil sales price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged for compared with for and in as a result of the level of oil sale prices in argentina when compared with oil sales prices in other countries  oil exploration investments and consequent oil discoveries in argentina have not been sufficient to replace domestic production 
as a result  oil reserves in the country have fallen in recent years 
we cannot predict how world oil prices will evolve in and beyond or what additional actions the argentine government will take in response to either future fluctuations in world oil prices or the drop in the level of the country s oil reserves 

table of contents natural gas prices we sell our natural gas to argentine customers pursuant to contracts and spot market sales 
as a consequence of the growth in argentina s economy over the past several years  and stimulated by low natural gas prices resulting from a price freeze implemented by the argentine government in  demand for natural gas in argentina has grown significantly 
however  the unfavorable price environment for producers has acted to discourage natural gas exploration activities 
without significant new discoveries of natural gas reserves in argentina  the supply of natural gas has failed to keep up with increased demand 
the result is a natural gas and power supply shortage in the country 
since  the argentine government has taken several steps to prevent shortages in the domestic market 
natural gas exports to chile were suspended and the country began importing natural gas from bolivia at significantly greater prices than sales prices for natural gas produced in argentina 
in addition  argentina was forced to import high priced lng 
as described in the following paragraphs  resolution is designed to supply natural gas in the domestic market and provide a framework for natural gas prices in argentina 
in  the argentine secretary of energy issued resolution to regulate the supply of natural gas in the domestic market for the period to through a natural gas supply agreement referred to as the acuerdo the resolution is intended to provide for equitable sharing of all sectors of the internal natural gas market among producers and establishes a mechanism for doing so based on average natural gas volumes produced from to the resolution determines which sectors of the market will have priority during periods of peak demand 
during peak periods  the residential market will have first priority 
with respect to the lower priced residential market  each producer s share of the residential market will be distributed based on an allocation of its volumes produced during the period to  while natural gas production in excess of those volumes can be sold to electric power generators at regulated prices  and industrial customers at freely negotiated prices 
producers that increased natural gas production since have an advantage compared to those producers whose production decreased over the period because natural gas prices to residential customers remain suppressed at approximately cents per mcf 
the resolution allows producers to choose to participate in the acuerdo natural gas supply agreement or not 
however  if a producer chooses not to participate  then during periods of peak demand  or when there is a shortage of natural gas in the country  the government can nominate non participating producers to be the first to supply excess residential volume demand above the base line demand as projected in the acuerdo  regardless of the non participating producer s contractual commitments 
in general  resolution has had a slightly positive impact on natural gas sales prices in acambuco and tierra del fuego  but  during peak demand periods  it has lowered natural gas sales prices in entre lomas and bajada del palo 
nevertheless  because natural gas revenues from entre lomas and bajada del palo represent approximately three percent of our total operating revenues on an annual basis  the overall impact of the resolution has not been material to our cash flows or results of operations 
our average natural gas sale price per mcf  averaged in  in  and during the level of gas reserves in argentina has fallen in recent years in a country that relies on natural gas for more than percent of its energy consumption 
given the government s tendency to intervene over pricing of a commodity in such high demand  we cannot predict how argentine natural gas prices will evolve in and beyond or whether the current argentine government will continue to maintain tight controls over prices or decide to loosen price controls in response to falling production and reserves 

table of contents seasonality of the products we sell  only natural gas is subject to seasonal demand 
demand for natural gas in argentina is reduced during the warmer months of october through april  with generally lower natural gas prices during this off peak period 
during  natural gas sales represented percent of our total operating revenues compared with percent in and percent in consequently  the fluctuation in natural gas sales between summer and winter is not significant for the company 
new accounting standards and emerging issues there were no new accounting standards issued in that we anticipate having a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that these particular estimates and assumptions are critical due to their subjective nature and inherent uncertainties  the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the following accounting estimates and assumptions as well as related disclosures with our audit committee 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas information in this report on form k are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by gaap and by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the reserve engineers and geologists that prepare the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by its reserve engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing  and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the company s proved reserves are limited to the concession life 
certain of our existing concession terms can be extended for years with the consent of and based on terms to be agreed with the argentine government 
the extension of our concessions could materially affect the company s estimate of proved reserves 
the present value of future net cash flows should not be assumed to be the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the and estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price received for the period january through december with the most current cost information 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depreciation expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our proved and unproved properties for impairment on a concession by concession basis and recognize an impairment whenever events or circumstances  such as declining oil and gas prices  indicate that a property s carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating future net revenues  we assume costs will escalate annually and apply an oil and gas price forecast that we believe to be reasonable 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and governmental regulations in argentina  it is possible that the our assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future 
however  at prices equivalent to those at year end  we do not expect to recognize any impairments in the near term 
we could  depending upon the results of exploration  determine that some or all of our interests in unproved areas need to be impaired as we drill and evaluate certain of these areas in future periods 
for example  we have million of unproved properties related to our operations in colombia  if our exploration drilling planned for is unsuccessful  we may have to recognize an impairment loss related to this asset

table of contents vs 
during  oil revenues increased by million  or three percent compared with a nine percent increase in total consolidated oil sales volumes resulted in a positive variance of million 
successful drilling in our neuqu n basin properties and increased condensate production in our austral basin properties were the primary drivers of higher sales volumes 
however  the benefit of greater sales volumes was offset by a six percent decrease in average oil sales prices which resulted in a million decrease in revenues 
natural gas revenues vs 
natural gas revenues increased by million  or percent compared with the construction of production facilities and well connections in our bajada del palo and charco del palenque concessions drove a seven percent increase in consolidated natural gas sales volumes for the year  resulting in an thousand benefit to revenues

vs 
during  natural gas revenues increased by million  or percent compared with production facility enhancements and well connections in our tierra del fuego operations drove a percent increase in consolidated natural gas sales volumes for the year  resulting in a million benefit to revenues 
additionally  a percent increase in average natural gas sales prices resulted in a million increase in revenues for the year 
higher average natural gas sales prices are primarily attributable to a gas sales contract allowing for a portion of our tierra del fuego production volumes to be delivered to higher priced industrial markets 
in addition  the argentine government allowed natural gas sales prices in low priced residential markets to increase from approximately per mcf to per mcf beginning in the third quarter lpg revenues vs 
lpg revenues increased by thousand in as improved market conditions in argentina allowed for higher average lpg sales prices during the year 
vs 
lpg revenues decreased by million in  or percent compared with  as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower prices 
in  decreased international commodity prices and market conditions in argentina resulted in a percent decrease in average lpg sales prices  which decreased revenues by million 
other operating revenues vs 
other operating revenues increased by thousand during compared with the majority of our other operating revenues relates to value added tax collections related to hydrocarbon sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 
for oil  natural gas  and lpg that is produced on the island of tierra del fuego and sold domestically to continental argentina  sellers are allowed to retain the value added tax collected from buyers as part of the island s tax exemption rules 
this mechanism effectively increases our realized prices by percent for sales made to the continent 
as a result  fluctuations in our other operating revenues are driven by sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 
vs 
other operating revenues increased by thousand during compared with due to greater amounts of value added tax collections resulting from increased sales revenues from our operations in tierra del fuego 

table of contents total costs and operating expenses vs 
total costs and operating expenses increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the following factors production and lifting costs increased by million  or percent due to greater operation and maintenance expenses related to our neuqu n and austral basin properties 
these increases were driven by the growth in our operations and the impact of inflation in argentina  exploration expense increased by million due to significant exploration activity in including expenses related to the acquisition and processing of seismic information in colombia for million and million in our neuqu n basin properties 
exploration activity in was minimal  provincial production taxes increased million related to greater operating revenues from higher sales prices 
vs 
total costs and operating expenses decreased by thousand due to certain offsetting variances 
specifically  lower exploration expense offset increases in certain operating costs as follows exploration expense decreased by million due to the absence of dry hole expense for unsuccessful exploratory wells and lower exploration activity including acquiring less amounts of d seismic information  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased by million  or percent primarily due to increased volumes 
see below for a more detailed discussion of dd a expense  and selling and administrative expense increased by million due to higher business development activity reflecting management s strategy to search for and evaluate growth opportunities and increased salaries and wages 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses dd a our dd a expense is based on the units of production method  which in basic terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved developed reserves produced each period times the net carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties 
our proved developed reserves are limited to an area s concession life even though a concession s term can be extended for years based on terms to be agreed with and the consent of the government 
in the third quarter of  the terms for a portion of our concessions were extended until and the extensions have had a favorable effect on our average dd a rates beginning in the third quarter of compared with prior periods as more proved producing reserves are included in our dd a calculation 
we are working to obtain the ten year concession extensions for our properties in r o negro and tierra del fuego which currently have concession terms ending in if any extensions are obtained  we expect to experience an additional favorable effect on future dd a rates as wells whose productive lives extend beyond will result in the addition of proved producing reserves

dd a increased by million in compared with primarily due to greater volumes and increased dd a rates 
our dd a rate increased in because we add less proved reserves per well drilled for calculating depreciation with each year that passes without obtaining the remaining ten year extensions for our concessions because our proved reserves are limited to the current concession life 
vs 
dd a increased by million in compared with as seen in the table above  the majority of the increase in dd a expense was due to greater volumes  which is contrary to our historical trend 
although our dd a rate increased for the year  in our year over year dd a rate increased at a decelerating rate  or was only two percent greater than it was in  which is a significantly lower rate compared with previous years including the percent increase we experienced in various factors contributed to this deceleration of increased dd a rates we have experienced  including the previously mentioned concession extensions  the increased proportion of sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis due to greater natural gas sales volumes from our tierra del fuego concessions which lowers our weighted average dd a rate  and increased proved reserves from successful drilling in our neuqu n basin properties 
investment income vs 
in  our total investment income increased by million  or percent  due to greater equity income from argentine investment 
the increase in our equity income is due to an increase in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera 
the comparative increase in petrolera s net income is a result of greater revenues driven by higher oil  natural gas and lpg average sales prices 

table of contents vs 
in  our total investment income decreased by million  or percent  primarily due to a million decrease in equity income from argentine investment 
the decrease in our equity income is due to a decrease in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera 
the comparative decrease in petrolera s net income is a result of lower oil and lpg sales prices and increased depreciation expense 
these two factors more than offset the benefits of greater oil sales volumes attributable to successful exploration and development drilling in our joint operations in the neuqu n basin 
additionally  interest and other income decreased by thousand compared to due to lower yields on our financial investments and lower balances of cash equivalents 
income taxes vs 
income taxes increased by million compared with in direct relation to our increase in pre tax income in argentina 
the effective income tax rate on the total provision for is greater than the effective income tax rate in the prior year primarily due to the greater amounts of exploration activity in colombia which provide no benefit to income tax expense during the period 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
vs 
income taxes increased by million compared to although our income before income taxes is only three percent higher in compared with  the effective tax rate for the period increased due to higher non deductible costs including greater foreign exchange losses and higher general and administrative expenses in our home office  lower interest and other income which is not subject to income tax  lower equity earnings from argentine investments which is recorded on an after tax basis  and exploration expenses incurred in colombia which are not deductible until we generate revenues in that country 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as previously discussed  the price of wti crude oil and oil price realizations in argentina have been on a steady upward trend during and  reaching an average price of per barrel in december for  operating results and cash flows from operations are expected to be greater than levels if oil prices continue their upward trend 
our oil price realizations continue to be negotiated on a short term basis  and as such  we cannot accurately predict how they will evolve beyond higher oil prices also benefit petrolera s cash flows from operations and its ability to pay dividends 
higher product prices resulted in petrolera paying more dividends in than in petrolera s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon numerous factors  including its cash flows provided by operating activities  levels of capital spending  changes in crude oil and natural gas prices  and debt and interest payments 
due to expected increases in capital spending for development and exploration activities in our neuqu n basin properties and petrolera s scheduled principal and interest payments  we expect petrolera to pay less dividends during the next several years compared with dividends paid over the past three years 
we will continue to monitor our capital programs and the quarterly shareholder dividend as necessary to provide apco with the financial resources and liquidity needed to continue development drilling in its core properties over the long term  fund new investment opportunities  meet future working capital needs and fund any further cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions  if any  while maintaining sufficient liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 

table of contents we estimate capital expenditures net to our direct working interests will total approximately million in due to our remaining funding commitment to pay for percent of two additional wells in coir n amargo  increased exploration and development activities in our core areas for the year and in anticipation of obtaining the ten year concession extensions for our properties in r o negro and tierra del fuego  in we negotiated a loan agreement with a financial institution for a million bank line of credit 
we expect the agreement to be effective by the end of the first quarter of if executed  borrowings under this facility will be unsecured and will bear interest at libor plus four percent per annum plus a commitment fee for the unused portion of the loan amount 
the funds can be borrowed during a one year period from the effective date of the loan agreement  and principal amounts will be repaid in four equal installments over four years from each borrowing date after a two and a half year grace period 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our proposed line of credit 
liquidity although we have interests in several oil and gas properties in argentina  our direct participation in those neuqu n basin properties in which we are partners with petrolera and dividends from our equity interest in petrolera are the largest contributors to our net cash provided by operating activities 
we have historically funded capital programs and past property acquisitions with internally generated cash flow 
we have not relied on debt or equity as sources of capital due to the turmoil that periodically affects argentina s economy which made financing difficult to obtain at reasonable terms 
however  as has been the case with financing for petrolera  we observed an improvement in financing terms for companies doing business in argentina 
consequently  we negotiated the previously described million line of credit in the first quarter of with a cash and cash equivalents balance at december   of million  or percent of total assets  our proposed bank line of credit  and the ability to adjust capital spending as necessary  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to effectively manage our business in although apco has not typically relied on debt or equity as sources of capital  successful exploration efforts in argentina or colombia could lead to development capital needs that are currently beyond apco s ability to fund from operations 
consequently  if necessary  we may have to consider additional bank financing or some form of equity financing in the future 
our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for letters of credit for exploration activities in colombia 
a total of million is considered restricted and included in restricted cash as of december  in january  the first exploration phase letter of credit of million expired and a second letter of credit valid for months was issued and collateralized by million of cash 
we expect to issue another million letter of credit for another exploration block in the first quarter of the restricted cash is invested in a short term money market account with a financial institution 

table of contents cash flow analysis the following table summarizes the change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown 
sources uses of cash years ended december  thousands net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million compared with due to higher operating income and greater dividends from our equity investment in petrolera

in addition  we plan on spending approximately million for the acquisition of seismic information 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital expenditure budget for is million 
any cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions would result in additional capital expenditures 
we expect the company and petrolera to have sufficient capital resources to fund our investment programs in we review our capital spending programs throughout the year in light of any changing economic or price conditions and  if necessary  will adjust our planned investments accordingly

in the current regulatory environment  the combination of hydrocarbon export taxes and strict government controls over argentine gasoline prices directly impacts net backs for the sale of crude oil in the domestic argentine market 
as a result  our price is impacted more by government controls than changes in world oil prices and our netbacks have not been responsive to fluctuations in world oil prices 
therefore  we cannot accurately predict our future sales prices  and it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in world oil prices may have on our results of operations 
our oil sales price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged during and in during  when the per barrel price of wti peaked at in july and fell to nearly in december  our average price was 
table of contents foreign currency and operations risk our results of operations are exposed to currency fluctuation and any devaluation of the argentine peso against the us dollar and other hard currencies may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the value of the argentine peso has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future 
we are unable to predict whether  and to what extent  the value of the argentine peso may further depreciate or appreciate against the us dollar and how any such fluctuations would affect our business 
at december  the peso to us dollar exchange rate was argentine economic and political environment during the decade of the s  argentina s government pursued free market policies  including the privatization of state owned companies  deregulation of the oil and gas industry  tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors  liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of exchange controls 
the cornerstone of these reforms was the convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar 
these policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial economic growth during the early to mid s 
however  throughout the decade  the argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget  incurring repeated significant fiscal deficits that by the end of resulted in the accumulation of billion of debt 
the government subsequently defaulted on a significant portion of its debt in early in january  the national congress passed emergency law  which  among other things  overturned the convertibility plan 
the government subsequently adopted a floating exchange rate 
the emergency law directly impacted the company by establishing a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports effective april  in addition the government implemented strict controls over the price of natural gas including the freezing prices for residential consumption 
the abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in a strong devaluation of the peso 
by september   the peso to us dollar exchange rate had increased from to argentina s economy has since shown signs of stabilization with economic conditions improving considerably growing at an average annual rate of eight percent until as a commodity exporter  the country benefited from increases in the price of its agricultural and natural resource exports such as crude oil  generating surpluses in both argentina s international trade balance and the government s fiscal balance 
the government  when possible  took advantage of this environment by increasing certain taxes  such as the oil export tax in order to increase its total tax revenues and improve its fiscal balance 
over the last several years  the government has implemented various price control mechanisms in order to control inflation across many sectors of the economy 
in order to shield the argentine consumer from inflation  the government has implemented price controls over oil  diesel  gasoline and natural gas and imposed greater export taxes that result in lower energy prices in the country 
these price controls together with higher taxes impacted the balance of supply and demand for hydrocarbons leading to energy shortages which exist today in argentina and have created less favorable conditions for energy companies doing business in the country 
given the recent world economic crisis and economic contraction  demand for argentine exports fell off significantly and argentina s economy began to contract 
the reduction in economic activity in the country has reduced the previously described energy shortages in argentina 
in late  a sharp drop in world commodity prices  including oil and agricultural products  has strained argentina s economy 
sharply reduced exports resulted in reduced government export revenues and negatively impacted the country s fiscal balance 
argentina continues to suffer from inflation but did experience economic growth in
