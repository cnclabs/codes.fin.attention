table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we currently own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  attentive service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with which we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american favorites as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
we believe that our diverse menu and generous portions  combined with an average check of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
over the last five years  we have funded development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  a private offering of common stock completed during november  a rights offering completed during june  and cash flows from operations 
we opened our newest restaurant in baltimore  maryland on october  and opened four restaurants during in richmond  virginia  woodbridge  new jersey  eden prairie  minnesota  and tampa  florida 
we intend to pursue additional leases based on significant economic opportunity  subject to the availability of capital on terms acceptable to us 
despite the continued weakness in the us economy  we were able to achieve a modest increase in our comparable restaurant sales of in we believe improvement in the job market  coupled with improvement in consumer confidence and spending in general  will be important and necessary catalysts to drive guest traffic and higher guest check averages in casual dining restaurants in general and our restaurants in particular 
customer traffic and sales patterns have shown improvement throughout as evidenced by the sequential improvement in comparable restaurant sales from during the first quarter of to during the second quarter of to flat for the third quarter of and up during the fourth quarter of we target our restaurants to achieve an average annual unit volume of million following months of operations 
certain of our recent openings are trending lower than our targeted volume during the current economic environment 
we believe our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests discover our concept and we generate market awareness 
our restaurants are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
sales in most of our restaurants typically are higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million for six underperforming restaurants 
the asset impairment charges resulted from an evaluation of the long term prospects of each of these restaurants that have not been meeting sales  profitability  and cash flow targets 
we will continue to focus on each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved 
we experience various patterns in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and emplo yees become more efficient operating that unit 
occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on costs of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 

table of contents key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales percentage change 
same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change in same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our comparable restaurant base  divided by the total leasable square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  or preopening expenses 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance prior to application of corporate overhead 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
this measure provi des useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to more easily determine future financial results driven by growth and allows investors to more easily compare restaurant level profitability 
key financial definitions restaurant sales 
restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales  net of promotions and discounts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs 
labor 
labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations 
occupancy 
occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate  including base  percentage and straight line rent  property taxes  and common area maintenance expense 
we record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the initial term of the lease 
restaurant operating expenses

table of contents preopening expense 
preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation  payroll and related training costs for new employees  including food and beverage costs associated with practice and rehearsal of service activities  and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening 
we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening 
our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the l ocation of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and gains and losses on disposal of assets 
interest income and other  net

financial performance overview the following table sets forth certain information regarding our financial performance for   and year ended december  restaurant sales growth same store sales percentage change average unit volume in thousands sales per square foot restaurant operating profit in thousands restaurant operating profit as a percentage of sales same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change for same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
includes only those restaurants in the comparable restaurant base 
restaurant operating profit is not a financial measurement determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to loss from operations 
restaurant operating profit may not be comparable to the same or similarly titled measures computed by other companies 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors

year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased million  or to million during from million during the increase in sales is primarily attributable to restaurant sales generated from the opening of seven new restaurants since june  partially offset by overall traffic declines at our comparable restaurant sales base resulting from the weak us economy  high unemployment rates  and reduced consumer spending

the increase was primarily due to the opening of seven new restaurants since june as a percentage of restaurant sales  labor costs increased to during from during the increase in labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was primarily due to reduced leverage of fixed labor costs and hourly labor expense resulting from lower average weekly sales 
in addition  high labor costs from restaurants opened during the year also contributed to the increase in labor expense as labor expenses are typically higher than normal during the first several months of oper ations 
federal and state minimum wage increases  implemented during the second half of and during  also contributed to increased labor costs as a percentage of sales 
occupancy 
occupancy expense increased by million  or to million during from million during the prior year period

depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during reflecting decreased leverage from lower average weekly sales 
asset impairment charge 
during  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the write down of the carrying value of long lived assets associated with six underperforming restaurants that have not been meeting sales  profitability  and cash flow targets 
the asset impairment charges were based upon an assessment of each restaurant s historical operating performance combined with expected cash flows for these restaurants over the respective remaining lease term 
during  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million for one restaurant 
we have no plans to close any of these restaurants  however  we will continue to evaluate each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved 

table of contents interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net decreased million during compared to the prior year period due to lower interest rates received and lower investment balances 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our investment in auction rate securities

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  fluctuations in commodity and food protein prices  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  changes in government regulations  outside shareholder activities  settlements  damages and legal costs associated with litigation  new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements  and changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for new restaurant development and remodeling of existing restaurants 
subject to availability of capital on terms acceptable to us  we will pursue additional restaurant leases based on significant economic opportunity 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip each restaurant 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for t he construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our typical restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances of between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  permitting requirements  labor markets and other variables 
restaurants that are subject to ground leases and do not receive landlord tenant improvement allowances typically require a significantly higher cash investment 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements amounts in thousands december  december  cash and short term investments net working capital deficit at december   cash and short term investments exclude million in auction rate securities that were used as collateral for a line of credit 
proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the line of credit 
during  the auction rate securities were sold at par value and the line of credit was repaid 
the working capital deficit at december  and  is primarily attributable to accruals for payroll and professional fees 
cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants  have historically been significant 
over the last several years  we funded development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of equity financing and cash flows from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and the credit market environment 
our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations and general and administrative costs 
we believe existing cash and short term investments of million in addition to cash flow from operations is sufficient to fund planned remodels of existing restaurants 
any reduction of our cash flow from operations may cause a delay or cancellation of future restaurant development or remodels of existing restaurants 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
we plan to reduce this deficit through cost containment efforts and cash flow from operations 
financing to construct new restaurants may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans  financial condition  and results of operations 
additio nal equity financing may result in dilution to current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents bridge loan on march   and as amended on april   we entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement with certain accredited investors whereby we sold million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the notes were due and payable upon the closing of any offering of equity securities by our company generating gross proceeds to us of at least million 
for each  issued in notes  we issued to the noteholder three year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an aggregate exercise price per share of  which was equal to of the five day average of the closing price of our common stock during the five trading days prior to the date of issuance 
the bridge loan  including accrued interest  was repaid during june upon completion of the rights offering described below 
the holders of the notes exercised over subscription rights granted in the agreement and purchased  shares or of the total shares sold in the rights offering 
rights offering as part of the note and warrant purchase agreement  we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to conduct a rights offering with targeted gross proceeds to us of  pursuant to which each of our stockholders received one non transferrable subscription right for every shares of common stock owned on april  each subscription right entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share 
the terms of the agreement provided that any shares of common stock that were not subscribed for in the rights offering by existing stockholders were offered to the holders of the notes on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding and at the same subscription price as offered to the holders of subscription rights granted under the rights offering 
we sold  shares of common stock pursuant to the rights offering and received net proceeds of  after deducting  in expenses 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay amounts owed on the notes and the remaining proceeds were utilized to fund capital expenditure requirements 
equipment loans as of december   we had four equipment term loans with a lender  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans was  at december  the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and require monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  the loans mature between may and june the loans also require us to maintain certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of calculated at the end of each calendar year  and we were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of december  credit facility during october  as part of the settlement agreement with ubs  our broker from which we purchased auction rate security instruments  we entered into a line of credit that was secured by the auction rate security instruments held with ubs 
on june   we exercised a put option with ubs on our auction rate security instruments and used the proceeds of million from the sale of the auction rate securities to repay the outstanding balance under the line of credit of million  which was then cancelled by ubs 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented

our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash in the net decrease in cash from operating activities for in comparison to  is primarily the result of the timing of vendor payments and the collection of tenant improvement allowances from our landlords 
the net decrease in cash from operating activities for as compared to is attributable to the timing of deferred rent and vendor payments 
investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash and investments 
our capital expenditures for were million primarily attributable to the funding of construction for our baltimore  maryland restaurant which opened on october  and contractor payments for two restaurants that were opened during the second half of investing activities for also reflects the sale of million in auction rate securities and million in other investments 
net cash used in investing activities during was million primarily reflecting million to fund construction of four restaurants opened during net cash used in investing activities was million during r eflecting million to fund construction at three restaurants opened during and one restaurant opened during january  as well as capital expenditures for existing restaurants and other restaurants opened during this increase was partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of investments to fund this construction 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million during reflecting the repayment of million in borrowings under a line of credit with ubs and million in principal payments on equipment loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during reflecting million in net borrowings under a line of credit and million in net proceeds from the subscription rights offering completed during june  partially offset by million in principal payments on equipment loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during principally consisting of million in net borrowings under a line of credit offset by the purchase of  shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program at a total cost of million  and million in principal payments on equipment notes

table of contents the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
in addition  the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in restaurant operating results indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes in legal factors or in the business climate 
the assessment of impairment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
the recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful li ves  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if indicators of impairment are present and if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the restaurant assets  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
during and  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges for underperforming restaurants 
we continue to monitor the operating performance of each individual restaurant 
we may be required to record impairment charges in the future if certain restaurants perform below expectations 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 

table of contents our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to imp lement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option awards  which requires the use of a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent period s if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the commodity markets 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is commodity costs 
many of the food products purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  international demand  and other factors outside our control 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases
