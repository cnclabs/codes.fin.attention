item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scana  through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in parts of south carolina and in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary  scana markets natural gas to retail customers in georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast 
other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units 
a service company subsidiary of scana provides administrative  management and other services to scana and its subsidiaries 
the following map indicates areas where the company significant business segments conduct their activities  as further described in this overview section 
graphic 
table of contents the following percentages reflect revenues and income available to common shareholders earned by the company regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them 
of revenues regulated nonregulated of income available to common shareholders regulated nonregulated of assets regulated nonregulated key earnings drivers and outlook during  the lingering effects of an economic recession showed modest signs of improvement in the southeast 
at december  a preliminary estimate of seasonally adjusted unemployment nationwide was compared to comparable unemployment rates in the states in which the company primarily provides service in georgia  in north carolina and in south carolina 
though improved from december  these unemployment rates remain stubbornly high and indicate that economic recovery in the southeast lags the nation 
customer growth rates in the company regulated and retail gas business segments were slightly positive in  though customer usage within the regulated business segments continued to decline 
the company expects customer growth to be similar and usage patterns to continue in over the next five years  key earnings drivers for the company will be additions to rate base at its regulated subsidiaries  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for new generating capacity  environmental facilities and system expansion 
other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment  customer growth and usage in each of the regulated utility businesses  earnings in the natural gas marketing business in georgia and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses and taxes 
electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  genco and fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to approximately  customers in an area covering nearly  square miles 
genco owns a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and emission allowances 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
sce g allowed return on equity is for non blra expenditures  and for blra related expenditures 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
sce g is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and  therefore  the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 

table of contents sce g  for itself and as agent for santee cooper  has contracted with westinghouse and stone webster  inc for the design and construction of the new units at the site of summer station 
the contract provides that sce g and santee cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the new units  with sce g responsible for percent of the cost and receiving percent of the output  and santee cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining percent 
assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled  the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in  and the second in sce g latest integrated resource plan filed with the scpsc in february continues to support sce g need for of the output of the two units 
as previously reported  sce g has been advised by santee cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan  including the level of its participation in the new units 
santee cooper has more recently indicated that it will seek to reduce its ownership in the new units 
if santee cooper ownership interest in one or both of the units changes  sce g believes that one or more additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners 
sce g is unable to predict whether any change in santee cooper ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the new units 
any such project cost increase or delay could be material 
the successful completion of the project would result in a substantial increase of the company utility plant in service 
financing and managing the construction of these plants  together with continuing environmental construction projects  represents a significant challenge to the company 
sce g expects to receive a col for the new units from the nrc in late or early  which would support both the project schedule and the substantial completion dates for the new units in and  respectively 
environmental and safety reviews by the nrc are currently in progress and are part of the nrc month review schedule which began july  in  the scpsc approved sce g combined application pursuant to the blra seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order relating to the proposed construction and operation by sce g and santee cooper of the new units at summer station 
under the blra  the scpsc conducted a full pre construction prudency review of the proposed units and the engineering  procurement  and construction contract under which they are being built 
the scpsc prudency finding is binding on all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in accordance with schedules  estimates and projections as approved by the scpsc 
in may  two intervenors filed separate appeals of the order with the south carolina supreme court 
with regard to the first appeal  which challenged the scpsc prudency finding  the south carolina supreme court issued an opinion on april   affirming the decision of the scpsc 
as for the second appeal  the south carolina supreme court reversed the scpsc decision to allow sce g to include a pre approved cost contingency amount associated inflation contingency reserve as part of its anticipated capital costs allowed under the blra 
sce g share of the project  as originally approved by the scpsc  is billion in dollars 
approximately million of the anticipated capital costs in dollars represented contingency costs associated with the project 
without the pre approved contingency reserve  sce g must seek scpsc approval for the recovery of any additional capital costs 
the court ruling  however  does not affect the project schedule or disturb the scpsc issuance of a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity  which is necessary to construct the new units 
on november   sce g filed a petition to the scpsc seeking an order approving an updated capital cost schedule for the construction of the company new units that reflects the removal of the contingency reserve and incorporates presently identifiable additional capital costs of million 
a hearing on this petition is scheduled for april   and the scpsc is expected to rule on the request in may 
table of contents in january  the scpsc approved sce g request for an order pursuant to the blra to approve an updated construction and capital cost schedule for the construction of the new units at summer station 
the updated schedule provides details of the construction and capital cost schedule beyond what was proposed and included in the original blra filing 
the revised schedule does not change the previously announced completion date for the new units or the originally announced cost 
under the blra  sce g is allowed to file revised rates with the scpsc each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation 
requested rate adjustments are based on sce g updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of  and have been approved by the scpsc annually see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
on january   sce g  for itself and as agent for santee cooper  and westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services 
under these contracts  westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for summer station unit and the new units 
westinghouse will be sce g exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost plus basis 
the fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of summer station unit and the new units through sce g is dependent upon westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new ap passive reactors in the new units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources 
westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to summer station unit under a services alliance arrangement  and sce g has also contracted for westinghouse to provide similar support services to the new units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation in and  respectively 
the company expects that significant federal legislative initiatives related to energy  will be hampered through due to each chamber of congress being controlled by different political parties 
significant regulatory initiatives by the epa and other federal agencies  however  will likely proceed 
these initiatives may require the company to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels  nuclear or hydro facilities for example  under an res 
new legislation or regulations may also impose stringent requirements on existing power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such initiatives will be enacted  and if they are  the conditions they would impose on utilities 
the epa has publicly stated its intention to propose new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of ccr  such as ash 
such regulations could result in the treatment of some ccrs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities  such as sce g and genco 
while the company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be  the company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transportation and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to approximately  customers in areas covering  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes 
table of contents with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
one effect of the recent economic recession was an overall decrease in demand for natural gas which  coupled with discoveries of shale gas in the united states  resulted in significantly lower prices for this commodity in and retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to approximately  customers as of december   and includes regulated division customers described below throughout georgia 
scana energy total customer base represents an approximately share of the customers in georgia deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy competitors include an affiliate of a large energy company with experience in georgia energy market  as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
as georgia regulated provider  scana energy provides service to low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the gpsc  and scana energy receives funding from the universal service fund to offset some of the bad debt associated with the low income group 
scana energy contract to serve as georgia regulated provider of natural gas is for a term ending august  scana energy files financial and other information periodically with the gpsc  and such information is available at www 
psc 
state 
ga 
us which is not intended as an active hyperlink  the information on the gpsc website is not part of this or any other report filed with the sec 
included in the above customer count  scana energy regulated division served approximately  customers as of december  
scana energy and scana other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and other financial instruments  including commodity swaps and futures contracts  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
further  there can be no assurance that georgia gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve 
energy marketing the divisions of semi excluding scana energy comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control growth of costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
in addition  certain pipeline capacity available for energy marketing to serve industrial and other customers is dependent upon the market share held by scana energy in the retail market

from january until the july order  the 
table of contents scpsc allowed sce g to mitigate a significant portion of pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level of pension income which was included in rates 
this pension cost arose due to the significant decline in plan asset values during the fourth quarter of stemming from turmoil in the financial markets 
the company had recorded significant pension income in no contribution to the pension trust was necessary  nor did limitations on benefit payments apply  in or for any period reported 
afc afc is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress is capitalized

cash requirements for scana regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief

certain other business and financial risks arising from such climate change could also arise 
the company cannot predict all of the climate related regulatory and physical risks nor the related consequences which might impact the company  and the following discussion should not be considered all inclusive 
from a regulatory perspective  scana  sce g and genco continually monitor and evaluate their current and projected emission levels and strive to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions 
sce g and genco participate in the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also have constructed additional pollution control equipment at several larger coal fired electric generating plants 
further  sce g has announced plans to construct the new units which are expected to significantly reduce ghg emission levels once they are completed and dispatched  potentially displacing some of the current coal fired generation sources 
see also the discussion of the court action on the cair below 
even while the rule has been remanded  the requirements are still in effect thus requiring the scrubber and scr projects 
in  the epa issued the cair which requires the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nitrogen oxide and beginning in and  respectively  for sulfur dioxide 
numerous states  environmental organizations  industry groups and individual companies challenged the rule  seeking a change in the method cair used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
on december   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit remanded the rule but did not vacate it 
prior to the court of appeals decision  sce g and genco had determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the cair requirements 
sce g has completed the installation of scr technology at cope station for nitrogen oxide reduction and genco has completed installation of a wet limestone scrubber at williams station for sulfur dioxide reduction 
sce g also installed a wet limestone scrubber at wateree station 
the company has incurred capital expenditures totaling approximately million through for these projects 
the epa has proposed a revised rule which is currently being reviewed by the company 
any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the epa in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates 
in june  the epa issued a final rule for a one hour ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide emissions 
initial evaluation of this new standard indicated that sce g mcmeekin station in lexington county may be required to reduce its sulfur dioxide emissions to a level determined by epa and or dhec 
the costs incurred to comply with this new standard are expected to be recovered through rates 
physical effects associated with climate changes could include the impact of possible changes in weather patterns  such as storm frequency and intensity  and the resultant potential damage to the company electric system  as well as impacts on customers and on the company supply chain and many others 
much of the service territory of sce g is subject to the damaging effects of atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes and also to the damaging impact of winter ice storms 
to help mitigate the financial risks arising from these potential occurrences  sce g maintains insurance on certain properties and has collected funds from customers for its storm damage reserve see note to the consolidated financial statements

in december  the epa issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of ghg endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of section a of the caa 
the rule  which became effective in january  enables the epa to regulate ghg emissions under the caa 
the epa has committed to issue new rules regulating such emissions by november on may   the epa finalized the ghg tailoring rule  which sets thresholds for ghg emissions that define when permits under the new source review  the prevention of significant deterioration  and the title v operation permits programs are required for new and existing facilities such as sce g and genco generating facilities 
the company expects that any costs incurred to comply with ghg emission requirements will be recoverable through rates 
in the epa issued the camr which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants 
numerous parties challenged the rule  and on february   the united states circuit court for the district of columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units 
the company expects the epa to issue a new rule on mercury emissions in but cannot predict what requirements it will impose 
the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the new source review provisions and the new source performance standards of the caa 
as part of the initiative  many utilities have received requests for information under section of the caa 
in addition  the doj  on behalf of epa  has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities 
the primary basis for these actions is the assertion by epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal fired power plants constituted major modifications which required the installation of costly bact 
some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement 
to date  sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the current state of continued doj civil enforcement is the subject of industry wide speculation  and it cannot be determined whether the company will be affected by the initiative in the future 
the company believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the caa would be without merit 
the company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to cair previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with nsr 
water quality the cwa provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under the cwa  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued and renewed for all of sce g and genco generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges  has modified the requirements for new cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the epa has said that it will issue a rule that modifies requirements for existing intake structures by mid march the company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the cwa 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards

the provisions of cercla authorize the epa to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites 
in addition  the states of south carolina and north carolina have similar laws 
the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up 
in addition  regulators from the epa and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations

cgt currently estimates the total cost to be million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december critical accounting policies and estimates following are descriptions of the company accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation scana regulated utilities record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods in accordance with accounting guidance for rate regulated utilities 
in the future  in the event of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria of accounting for rate regulated utilities  and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company and sce g electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company environmental assessment program 
the company generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs would be necessary and  if they were  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december   the company net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers for which they have not yet been billed 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million at december  and million at december   compared to total revenues of billion and billion for the years and  respectively 

table of contents nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station unit  including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination  totals million  stated in dollars 
santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in summer station unit the cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use 
under sce g method of funding decommissioning costs  amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds and interest thereon  less expenses 
the trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies and cash held by the trust 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and changes in funded status as a component of net periodic benefit cost or other comprehensive income  net of tax  or as a regulatory asset as required by accounting guidance 
the company plan is adequately funded under current regulations 
accounting guidance requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting pension cost or income recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets 
net pension cost of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension cost amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have increased the company pension cost by million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been  the company pension cost for would have increased by million 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted 
the company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes or derives them from modeling techniques that incorporate market data 
only a small portion of assets are valued using less transparent so called level methods 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical performance  targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms 
as of the beginning of  the plan historical   and year cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return of was based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate 
as of the beginning of  the plan historical   and year 
table of contents cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively 
for  the expected rate of return is 
as noted in results of operations  due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded significant amounts of pension cost in and compared to the pension income recorded in and previously 
however  in february  sce g was granted accounting orders by the scpsc which allowed it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level that was included in then current cost of service rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations 
in july  upon the new retail electric base rates becoming effective  sce g began deferring  as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated retail electric operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense 
in november  upon the updated gas rates becoming effective under the rsa  sce g began deferring as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated natural gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense 
the pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations  and no contributions have been required since management does not anticipate the need to make significant pension contributions until after the company accounts for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans in a similar manner to that used for its defined benefit pension plan 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
the company used a discount rate of  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and recorded a net cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been million higher 
because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs  healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded 
asset retirement obligations the company accrues for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the obligations are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred  and associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
because such obligations relate primarily to the company regulated utility operations  their recording has no significant impact on results of operations 
as of december   the company has recorded an aro of million for nuclear plant decommissioning as discussed above and an aro of million for other conditional obligations related to generation  transmission and distribution properties  including gas pipelines 
all of the amounts recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision  particularly since such payments may be made many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will be recorded over time  however  these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the utilities remains in place 
other matters nuclear generation sce g  for itself and as agent for santee cooper  has contracted with westinghouse and stone webster  inc for the design and construction of the new units at the site of summer station 
the contract provides that sce g and santee cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the new units  with sce g responsible for percent of the cost and receiving 
table of contents percent of the output  and santee cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining percent 
assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled  the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in  and the second in sce g share of the estimated cash outlays future value totals approximately billion for plant costs and for related transmission infrastructure costs  which costs are projected based on historical one year and five year escalation rates as required by the scpsc

as previously reported  sce g has been advised by santee cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan  including the level of its participation in the new units 
santee cooper has more recently indicated that it will seek to reduce its ownership in the new units 
if santee cooper ownership interest in one or both of the units changes  sce g believes that one or more additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners 
sce g is unable to predict whether any change in santee cooper ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the new units 
any such project cost increase or delay could be material

under these contracts  westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for summer station unit and the new units 
westinghouse will be sce g exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost plus basis 
the fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of summer station unit and the new units through sce g is dependent upon westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new ap passive reactors in the new units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources 
westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to summer station unit under a services alliance arrangement  and sce g has also contracted for westinghouse to provide similar support services to the new units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation in and  respectively
