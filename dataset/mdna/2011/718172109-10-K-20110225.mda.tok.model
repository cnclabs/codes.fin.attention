item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 
the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows european union eastern europe  middle east africa asia latin america canada our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income  which we define as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the annual report 

table of contents we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products  net of sales and promotion incentives 
our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors  including the volume of products we sell  the price of our products  changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell 
mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium price brands to mid price or low price brands in any given market product mix 
mix can also refer to the proportion of volume in more profitable markets versus volume in less profitable markets geographic mix 
we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments  and  in those circumstances  we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products 
our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf  non tobacco raw materials  labor and manufacturing costs 
our marketing  administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our products  other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses  and costs incurred to develop new products 
the most significant components of our marketing  administration and research costs are selling and marketing expenses  which relate to the cost of our sales force as well as to the advertising and promotion of our products 
c narrative description of business our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture  market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 
our total cigarette shipments increased in to billion units 
we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately trillion units in  a increase over we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately   and in  and  respectively 
including the business combination with ftc on a pro forma basis  our total share of the international cigarette market was and in and  respectively

references to total international cigarette market  total cigarette market  total market and market shares in this form k are our estimates based on a number of internal and external sources 

table of contents distribution and sales the distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market  including retailer needs and capabilities  the wholesale infrastructure  our competitive position  costs and the regulatory framework 
our goal is to achieve speed  efficiency and widespread availability of our products  while contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners 
the four main types of distribution that we use across the globe  often simultaneously in a given market  are direct sales and distribution dsd  where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers 
distribution through single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution in a single market 
exclusive zonified distribution ezd  where distributors have an exclusive territory within a market to enable them to obtain a suitable return on their investment 
distribution through wholesalers  where we supply either national or regional wholesalers that then service the retail trade 
in many countries we also directly service key accounts  including gas stations  retail chains and supermarkets 
our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately  employees worldwide 
our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 
they have over time developed a long lasting relationship with the wholesale and retail trade  thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale  reflecting our leading market share position in many markets 
in addition  our consumer engagement teams work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches 
our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels  including  where permitted by law  point of sale communications  brand events  access restricted web sites  print  new digital technologies and direct communication to verified adult smokers 
our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail  email and other electronic communication tools 
promotional activities include  where permitted by law  competitions  invitation to events  interactive programs  consumer premiums and price promotions 
to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets  we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools based on the latest technologies and consumer trends 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and price 
our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  state owned tobacco enterprises  principally in china  egypt  thailand  taiwan  vietnam and algeria 
industry consolidation and privatizations of state owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives  and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 
we compete predominantly with american type blended cigarettes  such as marlboro  l m and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets 
we seek to compete in all profitable price segments 

table of contents procurement and raw materials we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world  the majority through independent tobacco suppliers 
we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including the united states  argentina  brazil  mexico  indonesia  ecuador  dominican republic  poland  colombia  the philippines and pakistan 
as discussed above  in june  we announced that our affiliate  pmb  will begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in southern brazil 
this initiative enhances pmi s direct involvement in the supply chain and is expected to provide approximately of pmi s global leaf requirements 
our largest sources of supply are the united states for virginia flue cured and burley tobaccos  particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands 
brazil  particularly for virginia tobaccos but also for burley 
indonesia  mostly for domestic use in kretek products 
turkey and greece  mostly for oriental 
argentina and malawi  mostly for burley 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 
in addition to tobacco leaf  we purchase a wide variety of other non tobacco materials from a total of approximately suppliers 
our top suppliers of non tobacco materials combined represent more than of our total non tobacco material purchases 
the three most significant non tobacco materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging  acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing 
in addition  the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our indonesian business

research and development our research efforts are focused on understanding the mechanisms of tobacco related diseases  and specifically the complex role of tobacco smoke constituents in the development of tobacco related diseases 
this research serves as the cornerstone for our efforts to develop products that have the potential to reduce the risk of tobacco related diseases 
those efforts currently focus on smoke generation at lower temperatures  heat generation and mass transfer  biotechnology  material science and the removal of certain harmful compounds from the tobacco leaf using agronomic practices 
we are undertaking research to enable us to predict whether and to what extent a product has the potential to reduce the risk of a disease caused by smoking 
this will be critical for making substantiated statements about the potential risk reduction of such products when commercializing them 
we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business 
we seek to be at the forefront of innovation 
significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products  resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products 
further  with the increase in product regulations  support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex  requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
finally  working through biotechnology partners  we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco 
the research and development expense for the years ended december   and is set forth in note additional information to our consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference to the annual report

risk factors 
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  our operating results  our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this annual report 
forward looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in filings with the sec  in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts 
you can identify these forward looking statements by use of words such as strategy  expects  continues  plans  anticipates  believes  will  estimates  intends  projects  goals  targets and other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are identifying important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document  particularly in the business environment section preceding our discussion of operating results of our business 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 
risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes 
significant increases in cigarette related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions 
these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 
tax regimes  including excise taxes  sales taxes and import duties  can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products  or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors 
because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category  tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets 
as a result  our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes  due to resulting lower consumption levels  a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid price or low price cigarette categories  where we may be under represented  from local sales to legal cross border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

table of contents the elimination of minimum retail selling price systems in the european union may adversely affect our business 
during the first half of  the european court of justice ruled against several eu member states austria  france  ireland and italy that had enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and  in some cases  other tobacco products on the grounds that such systems infringe on eu law 
as a result  austria and france have abolished their minimum retail selling price systems 
these developments could adversely impact excise tax levels and widen price gaps in those markets  which may adversely affect our business 
our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 
governmental actions  combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking  have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets  and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting  contraband and cross border purchases 
significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets  driven principally by the world health organization s framework convention on tobacco control fctc 
the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco  and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation 
the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers 
regulatory initiatives that have been proposed  introduced or enacted include the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges  restrictions or bans on advertising  marketing and sponsorship  the display of larger health warnings  graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements  restrictions on packaging design  including the use of colors  and plain packaging  restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines  requirements regarding testing  disclosure and performance standards for tar  nicotine  carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents  disclosure restrictions  or bans of tobacco product ingredients  increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and  in some instances  in private places and outdoors  elimination of duty free allowances for travelers  and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies 
our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands  in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 
litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ets could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions 
damages claimed in some of the tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  canada  israel and 
table of contents nigeria range into the billions of dollars 
we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed 
the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
please see item legal proceedings of this form k for a discussion of tobacco related litigation 
we face intense competition  and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of low price products or innovative products  higher cigarette taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products 
competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  state owned tobacco enterprises  principally in china  egypt  thailand  taiwan  vietnam and algeria 
industry consolidation and privatizations of state owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 
because we have operations in numerous countries  our results may be influenced by economic  regulatory and political developments in many countries 
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes 
in others  nationalization  terrorism  conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment 
economic  political  regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities 
in addition  such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations  which could reduce our volumes  revenues and net earnings 
in certain markets  we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 
in addition  despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct  given the breadth and scope of our international operations  we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 
our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences  which may be influenced by local economic conditions 
to be successful  we must promote brand equity successfully  anticipate and respond to new consumer trends  develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios  improve productivity  and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases 

table of contents in periods of economic uncertainty  consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands  and the volume of our premium price and mid price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 
we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting  contraband and cross border purchases 
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market 
we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand  although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity 
in addition  our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross border purchases 
from time to time  we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes  allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets  allegations of underpayment of custom duties and or excise taxes  and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights 
we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced  and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results by business segment business environment governmental investigations for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 
we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases 
we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking 
our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers taste expectations 
we may not succeed in these efforts 
if we do not succeed  but others do  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
further  we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers  which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 
our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates  and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and  for purposes of financial reporting  the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 
during periods of local economic crises  foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar  reducing our margins 
actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 
the repatriation of our foreign earnings  changes in the earnings mix  and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 
because we are a us holding company  our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
under current us tax law  in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost 
it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions  which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate 
additionally  the obama administration has indicated 
table of contents that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms  such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 
our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products  enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 
our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully  to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 
we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration  strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings 
there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 
government mandated prices  production control programs  shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 
as with other agricultural commodities  the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand  and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns  including those caused by climate change 
tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls  including government mandated prices and production control programs 
changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco 
any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices  quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 
our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 
the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance 
as a result  we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent

our smallest factories are mostly in latin america and asia  where due to tariff constraints we have established small manufacturing units in individual markets  several of which are make pack operations 
we will continue to optimize our manufacturing base  taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks 
the plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs 
item legal proceedings 
litigation general legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us  and or our subsidiaries  and or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions 
our indemnitees include distributors  licensees  and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend  as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments  if any  that may be entered against them 
pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi  pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa  and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa  excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 
various types of claims are raised in these proceedings  including  among others  product liability  consumer protection  antitrust  employment and tax 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
damages claimed in some of the tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  canada  israel and nigeria range into the billions of dollars 
the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions  together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims  demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the 
table of contents ultimate outcome 
much of the tobacco related litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty 
however  as discussed below  we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco related litigation 
we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
at the present time  while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur  after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco related cases  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco related cases  and iii accordingly  no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases  if any 
legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe  and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us  as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts  if any 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended 
however  we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 
the table below lists the number of tobacco related cases pending against us and or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february   december  and december  type of case number of cases pending as of february  number of cases pending as of december  number of cases pending as of december  individual smoking and health cases smoking and health class actions health care cost recovery actions lights class actions individual lights cases small claims court public civil actions during   individual lights cases filed in small claims courts in italy by one plaintiffs attorney were dismissed following an investigation by the public prosecutor into the conduct of that plaintiffs attorney 
because these were fraudulent cases not authorized by the purported plaintiffs  the courts dismissed all such cases 
we will no longer include these cases in our pending case count and are not including them in our dismissed case count 
since  when the first tobacco related litigation was filed against a pmi entity  smoking and health  lights  health care cost recovery  and public civil actions in which we and or one of our subsidiaries and or indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor 
nine cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs 
five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor  one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings  and three remain on appeal 
to date  we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand euros 
these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases  two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal 
to date  no tobacco related case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us  our subsidiaries or indemnitees 
does not include the  italian small claims courts cases discussed in footnote and does not include cases filed by this same plaintiffs attorney that were previously included in the above dismissed case count because they had been individually dismissed by the small claims courts 
in future financial statements  the cases filed by this plaintiffs attorney will no longer be reported in the dismissed or pending case counts
