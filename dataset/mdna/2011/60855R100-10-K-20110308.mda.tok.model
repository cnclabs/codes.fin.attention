overview molina healthcare  inc provides quality and cost effective medicaid related solutions to meet the health care needs of low income families and individuals  and to assist state agencies in their administration of the medicaid program 
our business comprises our health plans segment  consisting of licensed health maintenance organizations serving medicaid populations in ten states  and our molina medicaid solutions segment  which provides design  development  implementation  and business processing solutions to medicaid agencies in an additional five states 
our direct delivery business currently consists of primary care community clinics in california and two primary care community clinics in washington  and we also manage three county owned primary care clinics under a contract with fairfax county  virginia 
our health plans segment comprises health plans in california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin 
these health plans served approximately million members eligible for medicaid  medicare  and other government sponsored health care programs for low income families and individuals as of december  the health plans are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states  each of which is licensed as a health maintenance organization  or hmo 
effective january   we terminated operations at our small medicare health plan in nevada 
on may   we acquired a health information management business which we now operate under the name  molina medicaid solutions sm 
our molina medicaid solutions segment provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to state governments for their medicaid management information systems  or mmis 
mmis is a core tool used to support the administration of state medicaid and other health care entitlement programs 
molina medicaid solutions currently holds mmis contracts with the states of idaho  louisiana  maine  new jersey  and west virginia  as well as a contract to provide drug rebate administration services for the florida medicaid program 
we paid million to acquire molina medicaid solutions 
the acquisition was funded with available cash of million and million drawn under our credit facility 
with the addition of molina medicaid solutions  we have added a segment to our internal financial reporting structure in we now report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments i health plans  and ii molina medicaid solutions 
fiscal year overview and highlights during  we experienced diversified revenue growth thanks to increased enrollment in our health plans  our successful entry into the medicaid health information management business  and an acquisition that established us in a new state 
meanwhile  stronger medical management and disciplined cost control helped us realize improvements in our health plan medical margins 
many of these factors contributed to our company s strong financial performance in for the year  our net income rose to million  or per diluted share  an increase of over we earned premium revenues of billion  up over the previous year 
meanwhile  during a year when costs continued to rise for the health care industry  we achieved a medical care ratio of  compared with a medical care ratio of for fiscal year 
table of contents during  we continued to pursue the expansion of our medicaid health plan business 
in september  we completed the million acquisition of abri health plan of milwaukee  which served approximately  medicaid beneficiaries as of december  we also expanded our growing presence in texas  where we were already serving patients in the houston  san antonio  and laredo service areas 
in may  we were awarded a contract to serve medicaid managed care patients in the seven county dallas service area starting in february in september  we won an additional contract to administer the chip program including the chip perinatal program in predominately rural counties across the state 
as of december   we served approximately  children and pregnant women under this contract 
the new contracts not only provide increased scale for leveraging our resources in texas  they make molina an increasingly important player in a state where the potential revenue opportunity will grow as new medicaid beneficiaries qualify for coverage under health care reform 
in addition  during we expanded our operation of community based primary care clinics the business field in which molina began over years ago so that we can serve the needs of our patients while also serving the states that pay for their health care 
finally  on may   we acquired molina medicaid solutions  an acquisition which has complemented our core business model of serving government programs  expanded our service offerings diversified our revenue base  and expanded our level of participation in the medicaid program 
financial performance summary the following table briefly summarizes our financial performance for the years ended december    and all ratios  with the exception of the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio are computed as a percentage of premium revenue because there are direct relationships between premium revenue earned  and the cost of health care and premium taxes 
year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data earnings per diluted share premium revenue service revenue operating income net income total ending membership premium revenue service revenue investment income total revenue medical care ratio general and administrative expense ratio premium tax ratio operating income net income effective tax rate health plans segment our health plans segment derives its revenue  in the form of premiums  chiefly from medicaid contracts with the states in which our health plans operate 
the majority of medical costs associated with premium revenues are risk based costs while the health plans receive fixed per member per month  or pmpm  premium payments from the states  the health plans are at risk for the costs of their members health care 
our health plans segment operates 
table of contents in a highly regulated environment with stringent capitalization requirements 
these capitalization requirements  among other things  limit the health plans ability to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval 
as of december   our health plans were located in california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin 
additionally  we operate three county owned primary care clinics in virginia 
molina medicaid solutions segment our molina medicaid solutions segment provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to state governments for their medicaid management information systems  or mmis 
among the principle differences between the molina medicaid solutions segment and the health plans segment are the molina medicaid solutions segment  unlike the health plans segment  does not assume risk for medical costs 
we believe that over time the molina medicaid solutions segment will experience less volatility in profits than the health plans segment because the costs incurred for the provision of business process outsourcing services are less volatile than those incurred for the provision of medical care 
revenue earned by the molina medicaid solutions segment will be much less than that earned by the health plans segment 
the revenue earned by our health plans segment is intended to include the cost of the medical care actually provided to our health plan membership 
such costs typically amount to approximately of the revenue of the health plans segment 
the revenue received by the molina medicaid solutions segment is intended only to pay for certain administrative costs plus profit of the medicaid program not the actual cost of services provided to medicaid members 
in general  we expect the operating profit margin percentage generated by the molina medicaid solutions segment to be higher than the operating profit margin percentage generated by the health plans segment 
while total profit is likely to be lower for the molina medicaid solutions segment than for the health plans segment  the percentage of revenue that we retain as profit is likely to be higher for the molina medicaid solutions segment 
the capital requirements of the molina medicaid solutions segment are except in the case of new contract start ups considerably less than those of our health plans segment 
regulatory approval is not required for the molina medicaid solutions segment to pay dividends to us 
while we believe that the acquisition of the molina medicaid solutions segment diversifies our risk profile  we also believe that the two segments are complementary from strategic and operating perspectives 
from a strategic perspective  both segments allow us to participate in an expanding sector of the economy while continuing our mission to serve low income families and individuals eligible for government sponsored health care programs 
operationally  the segments share a common systems platform allowing for efficiencies of scale and common experience in meeting the needs of state medicaid programs 
we also believe that we have opportunities to market various cost containment and quality practices used by our health plans segment such as care management and care coordination programs to state mmis customers who wish to incorporate certain aspects of managed care programs into their own fee for service programs 
composition of revenue and membership health plans segment premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described in critical accounting policies below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed pmpm amount  pursuant to our medicaid contracts with state agencies  our medicare contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  and our contracts with other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates 

table of contents for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in all of our state health plans except new mexico 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs 
pmpm premiums for chip members are generally among our lowest  with rates as low as approximately pmpm in california 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the tanf medicaid population the medicaid group that includes mostly mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to in missouri 
among our medicaid abd membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in utah to  in ohio 
contributing to the variability in medicaid rates among the states is the practice of some states to exclude certain benefits from the managed care contract most often pharmacy and catastrophic case benefits and retain responsibility for those benefits at the state level 
medicare premiums are almost  pmpm  with medicare revenue totaling million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents the following table sets forth the approximate total number of members by state health plan as of the dates indicated as of december  total ending membership by health plan california florida michigan missouri new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total total ending membership by state for our medicare advantage plans california florida michigan new mexico texas utah washington total total ending membership by state for our aged  blind or disabled population california florida michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total we acquired the wisconsin health plan on september  as of december   the wisconsin health plan had approximately  medicare advantage members covered under a reinsurance contract with a third party  these members are not included in the membership tables herein 

table of contents molina medicaid solutions segment our molina medicaid solutions segment provides technology solutions to state medicaid programs that include system design  development  implementation  and technology outsourcing services 
in addition  this segment offers business process outsourcing services such as claims processing  provider enrollment  pharmacy drug rebate services  recipient eligibility management  and pre authorization services to state medicaid agencies 
molina medicaid solutions has contracts with five states to design  develop  implement  maintain  and operate medicaid management information systems mmis 
these contracts extend over a number of years  and cover the life of the mmis from inception through at least the first five years of its operation 
the contracts are subject to extension by the exercise of an option  and also by renewal of the base contract 
the contracts have a life cycle beginning with the design  development  and implementation of the mmis and continuing through the operation of the system 
payment during the design  development  and implementation phase of the contract  or the ddi phase  is generally based upon the attainment of specific milestones in systems development as agreed upon ahead of time by the parties 
payment during the operations phase typically takes the form of either a flat monthly fee or payment for specific measures of capacity or activity  such as the number of claims processed  or the number of medicaid beneficiaries served by the mmis 
contracts may also call for the adjustment of amounts paid if certain activity measures exceed or fall below certain thresholds 
in some circumstances  revenue recognition may be delayed for long periods while we await formal customer acceptance of our products and or services 
in those circumstances  recognition of a portion of our costs may also be deferred 
under our contracts in louisiana  new jersey  and west virginia  we provide primarily business process outsourcing and technology outsourcing services  because the development of the mmis solution has been completed 
under these contracts  we recognize outsourcing service revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the contract 
in maine  we completed the ddi phase of our contract effective september  in idaho  we expect to complete the ddi phase of our contract during we began revenue and cost recognition for our maine contract in september  and expect to begin revenue and cost recognition for our idaho contract in additionally  molina medicaid solutions provides pharmacy rebate administration services under a contract with the state of florida 
composition of expenses health plans segment operating expenses for the health plans segment include expenses related to the provision of medical care services  g a expenses  and premium tax expenses 
our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to medical care services and to accurately estimate medical costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with the providers 
we pay hospitals on a fee for service basis in a variety of ways  including by per diem amounts  by diagnostic related groups  or drgs  as a percentage of billed charges  and by case rates 
we also pay a small portion of hospitals on a capitated basis 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract  under certain circumstances  we pay escalated charges in connection with these stop loss agreements 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed pmpm payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  
table of contents and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit managers 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit manager are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 
other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance costs  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  and a portion of our information technology costs 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses 
for the years ended december   and  medically related administrative costs were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
see critical accounting policies below for a comprehensive discussion of how we estimate such liabilities 
molina medicaid solutions segment cost of service revenue consists primarily of the costs incurred to provide business process outsourcing and technology outsourcing services under our contracts in louisiana  maine  new jersey  west virginia and florida  as well as certain selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  certain indirect costs incurred under our contracts in maine prior to exiting the ddi phase of that contract in september  and idaho are also expensed to cost of services 
in some circumstances we may defer recognition of incremental direct costs such as direct labor  hardware  and software associated with a contract if revenue recognition is also deferred 
such deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term  consistent with the revenue recognition period 
we began to recognize deferred costs for our maine contract in september  at the same time we began to recognize revenue associated with that contract 
in idaho  we expect to begin recognition of deferred contact costs during  in a manner consistent with our anticipated recognition of revenue 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  health plans segment premium revenue premium revenue grew in the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to a membership increase of 
on a pmpm basis  however  consolidated premium revenue decreased because of declines in premium rates 
the decrease in pmpm revenue was due to the transfer of the pharmacy benefit to the state fee for service programs in ohio effective february  and missouri effective october  
exclusive of the transfer of the pharmacy benefit in ohio and missouri  medicaid premium revenue pmpm increased approximately over the year ended december  medicare enrollment exceeded  members at december   and medicare premium revenue was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december

the medical care ratio of the florida health plan increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to higher capitation costs and higher fee for service costs in the outpatient and physician categories 
the medical care ratio of the michigan health plan increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to higher inpatient facility fee for service costs 
the medical care ratio of the new mexico health plan decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced fee for service costs which more than offset decreased premium revenue pmpm 
the medical care ratio of the ohio health plan decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in medicaid premium pmpm of approximately effective january  exclusive of the reduction related to pharmacy benefits  partially offset by higher inpatient facility fee for service costs 
the medical care ratio of the utah health plan decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   due to improved financial performance in the second half of that improved financial performance was the result of reduced fee for service costs in the second half of and an increase in medicaid premium pmpm of approximately effective july  the medical care ratio of the washington health plan decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced fee for service costs which more than offset decreased premium revenue pmpm

income taxes income taxes were recorded at an effective rate of for the year ended december   compared with in the prior year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to discrete tax benefits recognized during the year relating to settling tax examinations  and higher than previously estimated california enterprise zone tax credits

acquisitions wisconsin health plan 
on september   we acquired abri health plan  a medicaid managed care organization based in milwaukee  wisconsin 
as of december   we expect the final purchase price for the acquisition to be approximately million  subject to adjustments 
as of december   we had paid million of the total purchase price 
in the first quarter of we will compute the final purchase price based on the plan s membership on that date 
molina medicaid solutions 
on may   we acquired a health information management business which we now operate under the name  molina medicaid solutions sm as described in overview  above 
florida health plan 
on december   we acquired of the voting equity interests in florida netpass  llc  or netpass 
the final purchase price totaled million 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments  and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze  and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and investment income 
such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity 
thus  any future decline in our premium revenue or our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of the payment of claims for the related health care services 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest 
these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of five years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be two years or less 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments 
as of december   a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities  and our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities 
all of our investments are classified as current assets  except for our investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as non current assets 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for year ended december  this decline was primarily due to lower interest rates in the annualized portfolio yields for the years ended december    and  were   and  respectively 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect to incur significantly losses due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our non regulated parent company in the form of dividends  when and as permitted by applicable regulations  for general corporate use 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
deferred revenue  which was a use of operating cash totaling million in  was a source of operating cash totaling million in in  the state of ohio typically paid premiums in advance of the month the premium was earned 
in  the state of ohio delayed its premium payments to mid month for the month premium is earned 
therefore  we did not receive advance payments for the ohio health plan s premiums during the change in deferred revenue was offset by increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  and other current liabilities 
cash used in investing activities increased significantly in compared with  due chiefly to the acquisition of molina medicaid solutions  which totaled million 
cash provided by financing activities increased due to funds generated by our equity offering in the third quarter of  which totaled million  net of issuance costs 
amounts borrowed under our credit facility to fund the acquisition of molina medicaid solutions in the second quarter of were repaid in the third quarter using proceeds from the equity offering 
reconciliation of non gaap to gaap financial measures ebitda year ended december  in thousands operating income add back depreciation and amortization reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows ebitda gaap stands for us generally accepted accounting principles 
we calculate ebitda consistently on a quarterly and annual basis by adding back depreciation and amortization to operating income 
operating income includes investment income 
ebitda is not prepared in conformity with gaap because it excludes depreciation and amortization  as well as interest expense  and the provision for income taxes 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the gaap measures of net income  operating income  operating margin  or cash provided by operating activities  nor should ebitda be considered in isolation from these gaap measures of operating performance 
management uses ebitda as a supplemental metric in evaluating our financial performance  in evaluating financing and business development decisions  and in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
for these reasons  management believes that ebitda is a useful supplemental measure to investors in evaluating our performance and the performance of other companies in our industry 
capital resources at december   the parent company molina healthcare  inc held cash and investments of approximately million  including million in non current auction rate securities  compared with million of cash and investments at december  on a consolidated basis  at december   we had working capital of million compared with million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively

table of contents credit facility we are a party to an amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of march   as amended by the first amendment on october   the second amendment on november   the third amendment on may   the fourth amendment on april   and the fifth amendment on april   among molina healthcare inc  certain lenders  and bank of america na  as administrative agent the credit facility for a revolving credit line of million that matures in may the credit facility is intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
we borrowed million under the credit facility to acquire molina medicaid solutions in the second quarter of during the third quarter of  we repaid this amount using proceeds from our equity offering  described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   and  there was no outstanding principal debt balance under the credit facility 
however  as of december   our lenders had issued two letters of credit in the aggregate principal amount of million in connection with the contract of mms with the states of maine and idaho 
to the extent that in the future we incur any obligations under the credit facility  such obligations will be secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our health plan subsidiaries with the exception of the california health plan 
the credit facility includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  investments  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to at any time 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility 
the commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the credit facility is basis points on all levels of the pricing grid  with the pricing grid referring to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda 
the pricing for libor loans and base rate loans is basis points at every level of the pricing grid 
thus  the applicable margins under the credit facility range between and for libor loans  and between and for base rate loans 
the credit facility carves out from our indebtedness and restricted payment covenants under the credit facility the million current principal amount of the convertible senior notes  although the million indebtedness is included in the calculation of our consolidated leverage ratio 
the fixed charge coverage ratio set forth pursuant to the credit facility was x on a pro forma basis at december   and x thereafter 
the fifth amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility to to for the fourth quarter of on a pro forma basis  and to to for the first and second quarters of  and through august  effective as of august   the consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility reverted back to to in connection with the lenders approval of the fifth amendment  we paid an amendment fee of basis points on the amount of each consenting lender s commitment 
we also paid an incremental commitment fee of basis points based on each lender s unfunded commitment during the period from the effective date of the fifth amendment through august  shelf registration statement in december  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission covering the issuance of up to million of our securities  including common stock  warrants  or debt securities  and up to  shares of outstanding common stock that may be sold from time to time by the molina siblings trust as a selling stockholder 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
as a result of the offering described below  we may now offer up to million of our securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement 
in august  we sold  shares of common stock covered by this registration statement 
the public offering price for this sale was per share  net of the underwriting discount 
our proceeds from the sales totaled approximately million  net of the issuance costs 
we used the proceeds from these sales to repay the credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
also in august  the molina siblings trust  as a selling stockholder  sold  shares of outstanding common stock covered by this registration statement 

table of contents securities purchase programs under securities purchase programs announced in  we purchased and retired million face amount of our convertible senior notes 
also during  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for million 
convertible senior notes in october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
during  we purchased and retired million face amount of the notes 
as of december   the remaining aggregate principal amount of the notes was million 
the notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
in addition  if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our principal operations are conducted through our health plan subsidiaries operating in california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin 
the health plans are subject to state laws that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to molina healthcare  inc as the sole stockholder of each of our health plans 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends totaled million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  adopted rules effective december   which  if adopted by a particular state  set minimum capitalization requirements for health plans and other insurance entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
these rules  which vary slightly from state to state  have been adopted in michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin 
california and florida have not adopted rbc rules and have not given notice of any intention to do so 
the rbc rules  if adopted by california and florida  may increase the minimum capital required by those states 
at december   our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared to the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our health plans were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements at december  we have the ability and commitment to provide additional working capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements through critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our most significant accounting policies relate to the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized under certain contracts that place revenue at risk dependent upon the achievement of certain quality or administrative measurements  or the expenditure of certain percentages of revenue on defined expenses  or requirements that we return a certain portion of our profits to state governments

revenue recognition health plans segment certain components of premium revenue of our health plans segment are subject to accounting estimates  and are therefore subject to retroactive revision 
chief among these are florida health plan medical cost floor minimum for behavioral health a portion of premium revenue paid to our florida health plan by the state of florida may be refunded to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined behavioral health care costs 
at december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of this contract provision 
if the state of florida disagrees with our interpretation of the existing contract terms  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
any changes to the terms of this provision  including revisions to the definitions of premium revenue or behavioral health care costs  the period of time over which performance is measured or the manner of its measurement  or the percentages used in the calculations  may affect the profitability of our florida health plan 
new mexico health plan medical cost floors minimums and administrative cost and profit ceilings maximums a portion of premium revenue paid to our new mexico health plan by the state of new mexico may be refunded to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs  or if administrative costs or profit as defined exceed certain amounts 
our contract with the state of new mexico requires that we spend a minimum percentage of premium revenue on certain explicitly defined medical care costs the medical cost floor 
our contract is for a three year period  and the medical cost floor is based on premiums and medical care costs over the entire contract period 
effective july   our new mexico health plan entered into a new three year contract that  in addition to retaining the medical cost floor  added certain limits on the amount our new mexico health plan can a expend on administrative costs  and b retain as profit

new mexico health plan at risk premium revenue under our contract with the state of new mexico  up to of our new mexico health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care and administrative measures dictated by the state 
the state of new mexico s fiscal year ends june  and open contract years typically include the current state fiscal year and the immediately preceding state fiscal year two state fiscal years in total 
for the two open state fiscal years ending june   our new mexico health plan has received million in at risk revenue as of december  to date  we have recognized million of that amount as revenue  and recorded a liability of approximately million as of december   for the remainder 
if the state of new mexico disagrees with our estimation of our compliance with the at risk premium requirements  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
ohio health plan at risk premium revenue under our contract with the state of ohio  up to of our ohio health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met

for the two open state fiscal years ending june   our ohio health plan has received million in at risk revenue as of december  to date  we have recognized million of that amount as revenue and recorded a liability of approximately million as of december   for the remainder 
if the state of ohio disagrees with our estimation of our compliance with the at risk premium requirements  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
during the third quarter of  we reversed the recognition of approximately million of at risk revenue previously recognized 
utah health plan premium revenue our utah health plan may be entitled to receive additional premium revenue from the state of utah as an incentive payment for saving the state of utah money in relation to fee for service medicaid 
in prior years  we estimated amounts we believed were recoverable under our savings sharing agreement with the state of utah based on available information and our interpretation of our contract with the state 
the state may not agree with our interpretation or our application of the contract language  and it may also not agree with the manner in which we have processed and analyzed our member claims and encounter records 
thus  the ultimate amount of savings sharing revenue that we realize from prior years may be subject to negotiation with the state 
during  as a result of an ongoing disagreement with the state of utah  we wrote off the entire receivable  totaling million 
our utah health plan continues to assert its claim to the amounts believed to be due under the savings share agreement 
when additional information is known  or resolution is reached with the state regarding the appropriate savings sharing payment amount for prior years  we will adjust the amount of savings sharing revenue recorded in our financial statements as appropriate in light of such new information or agreement 
no receivables for saving sharing revenue have been established at december  texas health plan profit sharing under our contract with the state of texas there is a profit sharing agreement  where we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income  as defined in the contract  above a certain specified percentage  as determined in accordance with a tiered rebate schedule 
we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the rebate  if any 
as of december   we had an aggregate liability of approximately million accrued pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas for the and contract years ending august of each year 
we paid million to the state under the terms of this profit sharing agreement during the year ended december   for the and contract years

medicare premium revenue based on member encounter data that we submit to cms  our medicare revenue is subject to retroactive adjustment for both member risk scores and member pharmacy cost experience for up to two years after the original year of service 
this adjustment takes into account the acuity of each member s medical needs relative to what was anticipated when premiums were originally set for that member 
in the event that a member requires less acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may recover premium from us 
in the event that a member requires more acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may pay us additional retroactive premium 
a similar retroactive reconciliation is undertaken by cms for our medicare members pharmacy utilization 
that analysis is similar to the process for the adjustment of member risk scores  but is further complicated by member pharmacy cost sharing provisions attached to the medicare pharmacy benefit that do not apply to the services measured by the member risk adjustment process 
we estimate the amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members heath care utilization patterns and cms practices 
based on our knowledge of member health care utilization patterns we have recorded a liability of approximately million related to the potential recoupment of medicare premium revenue at december  to the extent that the premium revenue ultimately received from cms differs from recorded amounts  we will adjust reported medicare revenue 
deferral of service revenue and cost of service revenue molina medicaid solutions segment the payments received by our molina medicaid solutions segment under its state contracts are based on the performance of three elements of service 
the first of these is the design  development and implementation  or ddi  of a medicaid management information system  or mmis 
the second element  following completion of the ddi element  is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing  or bpo arrangement 
while providing bpo services  we also provide the state with the third contracted element training and it support and hosting services training and support 
because they include these three elements of service  our molina medicaid solution segment contracts are multiple element arrangements 
we have no vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for any of the individual elements in these contracts  and at no point in the contract will we have vsoe for the undelivered elements in the contract 
we lack vsoe of the fair value of the individual elements of our molina medicaid solutions contracts for the following reasons each contract calls for the provision of its own specific set of products and services 
while all contracts support the system of record for state mmis  the actual services and products we provide vary significantly between contracts  and the nature of the mmis installed varies significantly between our older contracts proprietary mainframe systems and our new contracts commercial off the shelf technology solutions 
the absence of vsoe within the context of a multiple element arrangement requires us to delay recognition of any revenue for an mmis contract until completion of the ddi phase of the contract 
although the length of the ddi phase for any mmis contract can vary considerably  the ddi phase typically takes about two years to complete 
as a general principle  revenue recognition will therefore commence at the completion of the ddi phase  and all 
table of contents revenue will be recognized over the period that bpo services and training and it support services are provided 
consistent with the deferral of revenue  recognition of all direct costs such as direct labor  hardware  and software associated with the ddi phase of our contracts is deferred until the commencement of revenue recognition 
deferred costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the period of revenue recognition 
provisions specific to each contract may  however  lead us to modify this general principle 
in those circumstances  the right of the state to refuse acceptance of services  as well as the related obligation to compensate us  may require us to delay recognition of all or part of our revenue until that contingency the right of the state to refuse acceptance has been removed 
in those circumstances we defer recognition of any revenue at risk whether ddi  bpo services or training and it support services until the contingency had been removed 
in these circumstances we would also defer recognition of incremental direct costs such as direct labor  hardware  and software associated with the contract whether ddi  bpo services or training and it support services on which revenue recognition is being deferred 
such deferred contract costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the period of revenue recognition 
we began to recognize revenue and related deferred costs associated with our maine contract in september in idaho  we expect to begin recognition of deferred contact costs during  in a manner consistent with our anticipated recognition of revenue 
unamortized deferred contract costs relating to the molina medicaid solutions segment at december  were million 
the recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed on a periodic basis using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term 
if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs  the deferred contract costs are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency 
if a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs to zero  any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment 
any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
medical claims and benefits payable health plans segment the following table provides the details of our medical claims and benefits payable as of the dates indicated december  in thousands fee for service claims incurred but not paid ibnp capitation payable pharmacy other the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  unpaid fee for service claims  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid  or ibnp 
our ibnp  as reported on our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately 
table of contents pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
as indicated in the table above  our estimated ibnp liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of a capitated provider in ohio which we will subsequently withhold from that provider s monthly capitation payment  our ibnp liability at december  was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in increase decrease in estimated medical claims and completion factors benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the 
table of contents percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in decrease increase in trended per member per month medical claims and cost estimates benefits payable the following per share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of  and million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component  and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  once again using actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp 
it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind or disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which a large proportion of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnp 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnp and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments  if appropriate  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously 
table of contents reported  and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
specifically  completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that base reserves have been adequately set  we believe that amounts ultimately paid out should generally be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
however  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to range  as shown by our results for the year ended december   when the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of the reserves we had established as of the beginning of that year by 
as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our prior period liabilities in fiscal years and were less than what we had expected when we had established our reserves 
while the specific reasons for the overestimation of our liabilities were different in each of the periods presented  in general the overestimations were tied to our assessment of specific circumstances at our individual health plans which were unique to those reporting periods 
for the year ended december   we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million see table below 
this amount represents our estimate as of december  of the extent to which our initial estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at december  exceeded the amount that will ultimately be paid out in satisfaction of that liability 
the overestimation of claims liability at december  was due primarily to the following factors in new mexico  we underestimated the degree to which cuts to the medicaid fees schedule would reduce our liability as of december  in california  we underestimated the extent to which various network restructuring  provider contracting and medical management initiatives had reduced our medical care costs during the second half of  thereby resulting in a lower liability at december  we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million in the year ended december  see table below 
this was primarily caused by the overestimation of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable at december  the overestimation of claims liability at december  was the result of the following factors in new mexico  we overestimated at december  the ultimate amounts we would need to pay to resolve certain high dollar provider claims 
in ohio  we underestimated the degree to which certain operational initiatives had reduced our medical costs in the last few months of in washington  we overestimated the impact that certain adverse utilization trends would have on our liability at december  in california  we underestimated utilization trends at the end of  leading to an underestimation of our liability at december  additionally  we underestimated the impact that certain delays in the receipt 
table of contents of paper claims would have on our liability  leading to a further underestimation of our liability at december  in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the following factors which we believe are reasonably likely to change our final claims liability amount the rapid growth of membership in our medicare line of business between december  and december  our assumption of risk for new populations in texas rural chip members and wisconsin medicaid members effective september  an increase in claims inventory at our florida  michigan  new mexico  ohio and texas health plans between september  and december  a decrease in claims inventory at our utah health plan between september  and december  the transition of claims processing for our missouri health plan from a third party service provider to our internal claims processing platform effective april  changes to the medicaid fee schedule in utah effective july  changes to provider reimbursement rates primarily for outpatient facility costs in new mexico effective november  the use of a consistent methodology in estimating our liability for claims and medical benefits payable minimizes the degree to which the under or overestimation of that liability at the close of one period may affect consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
facts and circumstances unique to the estimation process at any single date  however  may still lead to a material impact on consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing through general and administrative expense of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
in and  the absence of adverse development of the liability for claims and medical benefits payable at the close of the previous period resulted in the recognition of substantial favorable prior period development 
in both years  however  the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations because the amount of benefit recognized in each year was roughly consistent with that recognized in the previous year 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable for the periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in the pfm funds prime series institutional class  and the pfm funds government series 
these funds represent a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities that are managed by pfm asset management llc pfm  a virginia business trust registered as an open end management investment fund 
our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines 
no investment that is in a loss position can be sold by our managers without our prior approval 
our investments consist solely of investment grade debt securities with a maximum maturity of five years and an average duration of two years 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs
