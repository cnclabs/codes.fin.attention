the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
the company s financial statements are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 
overview winner medical s business operations consist of the manufacturing  marketing  researching and developing of cotton based medical dressings and disposables and consumer products 
the company has fourteen wholly owned manufacturing and sales subsidiaries and four joint venture companies  all located in the prc and hong kong 
the company has established several integrated manufacturing and processing lines for its core products 
the company s product offerings include medical dressings and medical disposables  which consist of medical care and wound care  as well as purcotton products 
the company manufactures its products in china and sells its medical dressings and medical disposables both in china and abroad  with europe  the united states and japan serving as the top four markets 
the company also sells its purcotton jumbo rolls in both china and abroad  and purcotton consumer products mainly in china 
industry wide trends that are relevant to the company s business the medical dressings and medical disposables manufacturing markets are continually evolving due to technological advances and new demands in the healthcare industry 
the company believes trends in the industry towards improving medical care and higher quality patient conditions  changes in patient treatment approaches and technological advances will impact favorably on the demand for its products 
the company anticipates that these factors will result in a growth in sales of medical dressings and medical disposables and increase revenue for the company 
the medical dressings and medical disposables market is subject to consumption patterns and trends 
one such trend or consumption pattern relates to the age demographics of the end users of the company s products 
on average  the worldwide population is aging and life spans are generally increasing 
as the general population begins to include a larger percentage of older people  the company anticipates that more medical care will be required  and that will result in increased sales of the company s products 
another industry trend or consumption pattern in the company s industry is that hospitals are increasingly looking to reduce their costs 
hospitals reduce costs by seeking alternative products that increase efficiency or reduce labor costs 
for example  disposable catheters reduce the need for frequent changes of diapers and bed sheets 
other popular disposables used by hospitals to reduce operating costs include eustachian tubes and needles  disposable clothing and accessories 
the company believes the demand for cost effective products and healthcare solutions and an increasing emphasis on health worldwide will bring an increase in the demand for medical instruments  medical dressings and medical disposables 
for global medical dressings  the company believes that there is a geographical shift in product manufacturing from countries with high labor and manufacturing costs to countries where labor and manufacturing costs are generally lower 
as a result of the relatively low cost structure and rapid development of the china economy  some foreign multinational companies are entering into the china market to seek suppliers to produce their goods 
the company believes that having more large multinational healthcare companies seeking suppliers to produce their products in china will benefit the company 
in addition  the company is negotiating with several large healthcare companies in developed countries which intend to outsource some of their production lines 
the company believes that china s local market demand for medical dressings and medical disposables will continue to grow along with corresponding increases in per capita income as more affluent people demand higher quality medical services and products 
this presents a significant opportunity for the company  since the company believes that it provides relatively higher quality products than its peers 
however  the company s competitors compete with reduced prices and significant relationship with hospitals  as the company s entrance into the chinese medical dressings market has been more recent than its competitors 
in order to increase market share  the company is developing a distribution network to capture opportunities in china  mainly through local distributors  over the counter drugstore chains and direct sales to hospitals in hong kong and hospitals in parts of guangdong province 
specifically  certain employees have been placed in charge of communicating with local distributors in some major cities  such as guangzhou  fuzhou  chengdu  chongqing  wuhan  shanghai  beijing and shenyang 
also affecting the company s industry is the growing sensitivity towards protecting the environment and increased health concerns  as consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of the products they buy 
nonwoven medical dressings  medical instruments and medical disposables usually contain materials like rubber and polyester  which may result in restrictions on the purchase of these products under environmental protection regulations 
at the same time  such materials are not biodegradable and are composed of petroleum  a non renewable energy resource 
in recent years  cases of melamine tainted milk  recycled edible oil and contaminated vegetables have significantly raised consumers awareness about the environment they live in  the food they eat  and the products they use 
the company believes this trend will strengthen one of its competitive advantages because its new purcotton products are primarily made of natural cotton and manufactured in an environmentally friendly fashion 
the company believes its purcotton products will be a medium to long term growth contributor to its revenue  because they can be applied to consumer products as well as to the medical industry 
at the same time  competition among retail brands for women and baby care products is intense in china 
many larger foreign and domestic brands have increased their market shares by their product portfolios through various market channels 
the company may not attract a large amount of new customers from its competitors in the near future  while it has to expend start up costs in building sales channels and raising brand awareness among consumers 
customer membership for the purcotton retail business can be obtained by filling out an application form online or offline with a payment of rmb or approximately  members to enjoy an discount from retail prices when purchasing products 
the number of customer membership has rapidly increased to approximately  in november   from approximately  in august  the company believes that this increase reflects brand recognition by customers visiting its retail stores and online platforms 
chinese government actions in favor of the company chinese medical reform 
in  the chinese government announced that it intended to spend rmb billion on health care in the following three years in order to improve accessibility to and desire for medical care in china 
the chinese government s increased spending in the medical devices sector is expected to be a driving force of the company s future development 
increased government subsidies 
the chinese government continues to subsidize private enterprises to stimulate innovation  research and development  brand promotion and management improvement 
the company has already received and expects to receive some of these government subsidies 
vat tax reform 
the chinese government reformed its policy on value added taxes vat for purchased machinery 
starting on january   the input vat for machinery is eligible for reimbursement 
this policy reduces the company s cost on technical improvements to and purchase of equipment 
tax rebate policy 
the chinese state ministry of finance and state ministry of taxation announced that as of june   the tax rebate rate for exports of medical dressing and related products would be increased by two percent 
effective from june   the tax rebate rate for exports of all the company s medical dressing products  and also some types of medical equipment will increase from to  and the tax rebate rate for exports of the company s plastic and glass products will increase from to

winner medical has captured additional sales through supplying products directly to developed countries  which want to reduce their production costs by outsourcing labor intensive and low value production  and to developing countries 
the sales increase is particularly strong in brazil  an emerging market that is increasing its reliance on imported products due to the brazilian currency s appreciation and cheaper import costs as compared to higher domestic production costs caused by increasing labor costs and strict labor protection

the company captured this opportunity to expand its business in the area 
therefore  the company maintained steady revenue growth from europe and expects this will continue in the first fiscal quarter of net sales generated from the japanese market increased during the year ended september   to  from  during the year ended september  as a percentage of net sales  sales to japan were in fiscal year  as compared to in the same period of last year 
in this reporting period  the increase in net sales to japan was mainly driven by higher selling prices due to the increase in raw material cost and customers increasing their inventory of medical products for demand  especially during and after the earthquake that occurred in mid march of this year

by doing so  the company can lower its heavy reliance on traditional medical business and maintain a stable combined gross margin 
the company believes that the purcotton retail business has been well received by its target customers 
although the retail business accounts for only a very small portion of the company s net sales  it has a much higher margin than that of the medical products portfolio

sales of goods are recognized when title of goods sold has passed to the purchaser  usually when goods are shipped  the price is fixed or determinable as stated on the sales contract  and its collectability is reasonably assured 
customers do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
products returns to the company were insignificant during past years 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  determined by the weighted average method 
work in progress and finished goods consist of raw materials  direct labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing process 
trade accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from balances outstanding at year end 
based on management s assessment of the credit history with customers having outstanding balances and current relationships with them  it has concluded that realization losses on balances outstanding at year end will be immaterial 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable balances are recorded when circumstances indicate that collection is doubtful for particular accounts receivable 
management estimates such allowances based on historical evidence such as amounts that are subject to risk 
accounts receivable are written off if reasonable collection efforts are not successful 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost including the cost of improvements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciable amounts are net of expected residual value of assets 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows leasehold land over the lease term buildings years plant and machinery years furniture  fixtures and equipment years motor vehicles years leasehold improvements over the lease term valuation of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair market values are reduced for the cost to dispose 
derivatives the company does not use derivative for speculative purpose  nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative 
however  the company s operations are exposed to market risk primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates 
in order to manage such risks so as to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows  the company enters into several foreign exchange forward contracts with a commercial bank to hedge for future trade receipts in us dollars against rmb 
the company s foreign exchange forward contracts are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy under asc since the quote prices of these foreign exchange forward contracts can be obtained directly from commercial bank 
the company uses commodity financial instruments to manage the risk of cotton purchase cost 
although the commodity financial instruments are economic hedges of specified risks  the company has not designated or accounted for them as hedging instruments 
the company s commodity financial instruments are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy under asc since the quoted unadjusted prices of these commodity financial instruments are available in active markets 
income taxes income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
any tax paid by subsidiaries during the year is recorded 
current tax is based on the profit or loss from ordinary activities adjusted for items that are non assessable or disallowable for income tax purpose and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
deferred income tax liabilities or assets are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the financial reporting amounts at each year end 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized
