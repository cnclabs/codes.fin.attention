their complementary enterprise mobile cloud solutions enable us to address a wider spectrum of the mobile market by offering enterprises the leading solutions in both mobile performance monitoring and mobile testing and quality assurance 
all information  including critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations  in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations exclude deviceanywhere 
we deliver our products and services primarily through a cloud based model on a subscriptions basis also referred to as software as a service  or saas 
subscription fees range from monthly to multi year commitments and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of measurements  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements  the communication protocols or services measured and any additional features ordered 
our system integrated test environment site systems  which include monitoring software and hardware  usually are offered via a software license fee model that is bundled with ongoing maintenance and support 
our test center developer and enterprise products  acquired in the recent acquisition of deviceanywhere  are offered via hourly fee arrangements  on an annual subscription basis or a software license fee model 
our real user experience testing services  which we also refer to as our professional services or engagement services  primarily are offered on an engagement  per incident or per study basis 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 

table of contents our net revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the adoption of new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition described below had a million positive impact on net revenue in fiscal year excluding the positive impact of the new revenue recognition guidance  our net revenue in fiscal year increased by compared to fiscal year additionally  net revenue has increased due to an increase in internet and mobile customer demand and a stabilization of measurement pricing 
our net income increased by million from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the increase in net income is primarily attributable to an income tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  a million increase in mobile net revenue and million increase to internet net revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in total costs and expenses of million from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year due primarily to increased direct costs associated with higher revenue and related increases to headcount and other personnel costs 
effective with fiscal year  we adopted new revenue accounting guidance that had the primary effect of recognizing site systems revenue  excluding maintenance  at the time of customer acceptance rather than ratably over the contract term 
site orders received after september  are reported as system licenses for the hardware and software elements of those contracts and as maintenance and support for the remaining elements 
site orders received prior to october  the beginning of fiscal year continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as ratable license revenue 
we adopted this accounting guidance and prospectively applied its provisions to arrangements entered into or materially modified after october  as a result of adopting the new accounting guidance  we recognized net revenue of million and related direct costs of revenue of million for fiscal year that would otherwise have been recognized in subsequent periods under the previous accounting guidance 
we believe that important trends and challenges for our business include continuing to drive growth in our internet and mobile cloud products and services  as we believe that revenue growth is the primary factor in creating stockholder value  successfully integrating our recent acquisition  deviceanywhere  with our existing culture  products  procedures and systems and achieving revenue from sales of deviceanywhere products  growing our overall customer base and cross selling our products within our existing customer base to support the growth of our internet and mobile revenue  controlling expenses in fiscal to maintain profitability  particularly because of the economic uncertainties that continue to exist and the costs we are incurring to take advantage of growth opportunities  and meeting challenges faced due to the current economic environment as this affects our customers ability to purchase our products and services

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  
table of contents judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets stock based compensation income taxes  deferred income taxes and deferred income tax liabilities revenue recognition revenue from internet and mobile products and services is summarized in the following table for the years ended in thousands september  internet web measurement subscriptions other subscriptions engagements internet net revenue mobile subscriptions ratable licenses system licenses maintenance and support mobile net revenue net revenue subscriptions revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of products and services sold through a cloud based model on a subscription basis 
subscription arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software at any time 
subscription revenue is reflected in the above table as web measurement subscriptions which includes application perspective  transaction perspective  streaming perspective and web site perspective products and services  other subscriptions which includes all other internet subscription products and services and mobile subscriptions which includes globalroamer  mobile device perspective  mobile web perspective and mobile internet testing environment mite products and services 
we also sell monitoring systems to mobile network operators under licensing arrangements 
monitoring system arrangements with mobile customers for the sale of our automated test equipment typically includes software licenses  hardware  consulting services to configure the systems installation services  post contract support maintenance services  training services and other consulting services associated with our system integrated test environment site system 
monitoring systems revenue is reflected in the above table as ratable licenses which includes site systems arrangements entered into prior to october   systems licenses which includes the hardware and software elements of site arrangements significantly modified or entered into subsequent to september  and maintenance 
table of contents and support which includes all other elements of site arrangements significantly modified or entered into subsequent to september   stand alone consulting services agreements entered into subsequent to september  and all maintenance agreement renewals 
we supplement our cloud based subscriptions and monitoring systems with engagement services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a customer signed quote  contract  or purchase order to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery of the product or service 
subscription based services are considered delivered when the customer has been provided with access to the subscription services 
subscription services are generally delivered on a consistent basis over the period of the subscription with the customer having flexibility to define and change the measurement with respect to the type  frequency  location and complexity of the measurement 
engagement services are considered delivered when the services are performed or the contractual milestones are completed 
monitoring systems  excluding maintenance  are considered delivered when all elements of the arrangement have either been delivered or accepted  if customer acceptance language exists 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are standard 
collection is deemed reasonably assured 
collection is deemed reasonably assured if it is expected that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  then revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection 
we do not generally grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
free trials are typically stand alone transactions occasionally provided to prospective customers  for which no revenue is recognized 
subscription based services can either be billed in advance or in arrears 
for customers that are billed in advance of providing measurements  revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months  commencing on the day service is first provided 
for customers that are billed in arrears  revenue is recognized based upon actual usage of the subscription services and typically invoiced on a monthly basis 
regardless of when billing occurs  we recognize revenue as services are provided and defer any revenue that is unearned 
revenue associated with monitoring system hardware  software essential to the functionality of the monitoring system essential software  installation services and training is deferred until the later of delivery of the complete monitoring system or customer acceptance of the monitoring system  under the contractual terms 
revenue associated with the monitoring system product maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  usually one year 
non essential software purchased by customers in bundled arrangements is deemed to be a software element that does not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting as we do not have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
accordingly  non essential software revenue is recognized ratably over the product maintenance term 
engagements revenue consists of fees generated from our professional consulting services and includes services such as performance insights and customer research products 
revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed based on input measures  typically over a period of one to three months 
for engagement service projects that contain project milestones  as defined in the arrangement  we recognize revenue once the milestones have been delivered 

table of contents revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables we enter into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of monitoring systems combined with maintenance  installation and other consulting services  subscription services combined with engagement services  which include loadpro and webeffective  and multiple engagement services 
for arrangements entered into prior to october  prior to the adoption of the amended accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we were not able to establish vsoe for all of the undelivered elements associated with site systems  primarily maintenance 
therefore  we recognized the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the maintenance period  historically ranging from twelve to thirty six months  once the implementation and integration services are completed  usually within two to three months following the delivery of the hardware and software 
ratable recognition of revenue began when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware has occurred as intended under the respective arrangement contractual terms 
ratable licenses revenue consists of fees from the sale of mobile automated test equipment  related software and maintenance  and engineering and consulting services associated with site systems 
the hardware component of a monitoring system is deemed to include an essential software related element 
customers do not purchase the hardware without also purchasing the software 
none of the site services are considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed hardware or software products 
this assessment is due to the implementation integration services being performed during a relatively short period compared to the length of the arrangement 
additionally  the implementation integration services are general in nature and we have a history of successfully gaining customer acceptance 
site orders received prior to the beginning of fiscal year continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as ratable license revenue 
subscription arrangements are treated as a single unit of accounting given that the elements within the subscription arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting because sufficient objective evidence of fair value did not exist for the allocation of revenue 
as a result the entire arrangement fee was recognized as revenue either ratably over the service period  generally over twelve months  or based upon actual monthly usage 
for arrangements entered into subsequent to september  in october  amended accounting guidance was issued for multiple element revenue arrangements that provided updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using best estimated selling prices besp of each deliverable if a vendor does not have vsoe or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminated the use of the residual method and requires a vendor to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
also in october  amended accounting guidance for revenue recognition was issued to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
we evaluate each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
for arrangements within the scope of the new revenue accounting guidance  a deliverable 
table of contents constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements 
allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit relative selling price 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using its besp  as we have determined we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe of selling price for the deliverables 
besp reflects our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a deliverable by considering multiple factors including analyzing historical prices for standalone and bundled arrangements against price lists  market conditions  competitive landscape and internal costs 
effects of adoption we adopted the amended accounting guidance and prospectively applied its provisions to arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after october  the beginning of fiscal year 
the adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance had the primary effect of recognizing site systems revenue  excluding maintenance  at the time of customer acceptance rather than ratably over the contract term 
site orders received after september  are reported as system licenses for the hardware and essential software and as maintenance and support for the remaining elements 
site orders received prior to the beginning of fiscal year continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as ratable license revenue because vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
as a result of adopting the new accounting guidance  we recognized million of net revenue and million of related direct costs of revenue for the year ended september   that would otherwise have been recognized in subsequent periods under the previous accounting guidance 
if the new accounting guidance had not been adopted  we would have million of ratable license revenue  no system license revenue  no maintenance and support revenue and net revenue of million for the year ended september  revenue recognized related to multiple element arrangements entered into prior to october  was million for the year ended september  allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance dollars in thousands change change allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance gross accounts receivable percentage of gross accounts receivable these allowances are based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer ability to pay 
we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances 
accounts receivable are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 
the decline in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable was primarily due to the charge off of certain uncollectible receivables that had been fully reserved 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 

table of contents we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable from the results of operations of our single reporting segment 
in addition we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we continually apply judgment when performing these evaluations and continuously monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value  including long term revenue growth projections  undiscounted net cash flows  discount rates  recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies  volatility in the company market capitalization and general industry  market and macro economic conditions 
it is possible that changes in such circumstances  or in the variables associated with the judgments  assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit  would require us to record a non cash impairment charge 
our annual goodwill review in each of the fiscal years   and did not result in an impairment charge 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was million as compared to million as of september  the change in goodwill from september  to september  was a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which affect the goodwill amounts recorded in our foreign subsidiaries 
stock based compensation we issue stock options and restricted stock units to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
under current accounting guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units or the issue of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a period  our deferred tax expense increases 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on 
table of contents the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
this analysis is applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and requires significant judgment and consideration of all available positive and negative evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
tax planning strategies may be implemented which would affect the tax rate 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes and the nature of stock based compensation tax deductions can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 
the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors such as the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and the deferred tax assets are realized or a mismatch in the tax jurisdiction in which taxable income is generated and companies with the deferred tax assets 
in fiscal year  we determined that the positive quantitative and qualitative evidence  including cumulative earnings over the past three years  was sufficient to release million of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  if there is a significant negative change in our operating results or the other factors that were considered in making this determination  we could be required to record an increase to the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of october   we adopted guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

internet net revenue 
internet net revenue increased by million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  internet net revenue represented and of net revenue for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in internet net revenue for the year ended september  was mainly attributable to an increase of million in our internet web measurement subscriptions due primarily to an increase in the number of measurements that our customers are performing to test their web sites and stabilization of per measurement unit pricing  an increase of million in our engagements also referred to as professional services  and an increase of million in our internet subscriptions other 
internet net revenue decreased by million for the year ended september  compared to year ended september  internet net revenue represented of net revenue for both the years ended september  and the decrease in internet net revenue in absolute dollars for the year ended september  was mainly attributable to a decrease in our professional service engagements of million  our voip subscription services of million  and our webeffective subscription services of million  partially offset by an increase in our loadpro subscription services of million 
mobile net revenue 
mobile net revenue increased by million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  mobile net revenue represented and of net revenue for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in mobile net revenue for the year ended september  was attributable mainly to an increase of million in site systems  of which million was due to the adoption of new revenue accounting guidance discussed below 
additionally  mobile subscriptions increased by million due to increased customer demand for all products and the increased importance of mobile web sites to our enterprise customers 
mobile revenue decreased by million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  mobile net revenue represented of net revenue for both the years ended september  and the slight decline in absolute dollars was primarily due to a million decrease in mobile ratable licenses revenue as a result of fewer purchases of new site systems  partially offset by an increase in customers renewing maintenance on existing systems  and an increase of million in mobile subscription revenue as a result of an increase in the number of globalroamer customers 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting guidance for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
we adopted this accounting guidance and prospectively applied its provisions to arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after october  the beginning of our fiscal year 
the adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance had the primary effect of recognizing site systems revenue  excluding maintenance  at the time of customer acceptance rather than ratably over the contract term 
site orders received after fiscal year 
table of contents are reported as system licenses for the hardware and software that works with the hardware to deliver the essential functionality of the hardware essential software  and as maintenance and support for the remaining elements 
site orders received prior to the beginning of fiscal year continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as ratable license revenue because vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
as a result of adopting the new accounting guidance  we recognized net revenue of million and related direct costs of revenue of million for the year ended september   that would have otherwise been recognized in subsequent periods under the previous guidance 
if the new accounting guidance had not been adopted  we would have reported million of ratable license revenue  no system license revenue  no maintenance and support revenue and net revenue of million for the year ended september  see note to consolidated financial statements 
one customer accounted for of net revenue for year ended september  no customer accounted for more than of net revenue for years ended september  and as of september   one customer accounted for of our net accounts receivable 
one customer  different from the customer  accounted for of net accounts receivable at september  international sales were approximately  and of net revenue for the years ended september   and  respectively 
international sales increased primarily due to the adoption of the new accounting guidance discussed in the previous paragraph 
direct costs of revenue change change direct costs of revenue direct costs of revenue is comprised of telecommunication and network fees for our measurement and data collection network  costs for employees and consultants assigned to consulting engagements and to install site systems  depreciation of equipment related to our measurement and data collection network  and site systems hardware and supplies costs 
consistent with the presentation of net revenue  we previously presented direct costs of revenue under the following captions subscription services  ratable licenses  and professional services 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we are presenting direct costs of revenue as one line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
direct costs of revenue increased million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  and represented and of net revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in direct costs of revenue is mainly attributable to additional telecommunication and network fees of million due to higher volume associated with increased revenue  increased personnel costs of million due to increased headcount to support higher revenue  million as a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition see discussion above  million of excess and obsolete inventory charges and increased consulting costs of million to install site systems 
overall  direct costs of revenue have declined as a percentage of revenue due to the scalability of our monitoring network 
direct costs of revenue increased million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  and represented and of net revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in direct costs of revenue is mainly attributable to additional telecommunication and network fees of million due to higher volume associated with increased revenue  increased personnel costs of million due to increased headcount to support higher revenue  and increase consulting costs of million to install site systems 
partially offsetting the increase in direct costs of revenue was a decrease of million in depreciation 

table of contents development change change development development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  including stock based compensation and other benefits  and other costs incurred by our development personnel 
development costs increased million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  the increase was mainly a result of the increased personnel costs due to increased headcount  and the reinstatement in fiscal of domestic salaries previously reduced by in april the decrease in development costs for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was primarily due to lower personnel related costs and continued cost containment efforts 
operations change change operations operations expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  including stock based compensation and other benefits  for management and technical support personnel 
our operations personnel manage and maintain our field measurement and collection infrastructure and data centers  provide basic and extended customer support  and work closely with other departments to ensure the reliability of our services 
operations expenses increased million for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  the increase is mainly attributable to higher consulting services of million and increased personnel costs of million due to increased headcount 
our operations expenses decreased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to a million reduction in personnel related costs and continued cost containment efforts 
sales and marketing change change sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation  lead referral fees  marketing programs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  primarily due to an increase of million in additional personnel costs to grow mobile revenues and the reinstatement in fiscal of domestic salaries previously reduced by in april additional increases to sales and marketing expenses were due to million in consulting costs and million on marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in marketing programs and tradeshow events and of million in consulting costs to grow mobile revenue 

table of contents general and administrative change change general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  including stock based compensation and other benefits  professional service fees  including accounting  auditing  legal and bank fees  insurance  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  primarily due a million increase in compensation expense related to the reinstatement in fiscal of domestic salaries previously reduced by in april  million of transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition of deviceanywhere  and million increase in the reserve for bad debts 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent with an increase of million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs associated with additional headcount  partially offset by continued cost containment efforts 
excess occupancy income change change rental income rental and other expenses excess occupancy income excess occupancy income consists of rental income from the leasing of space not occupied by us in our headquarters building  net of related fixed costs  which consists of property taxes  insurance  building depreciation  leasing broker fees and tenant improvement amortization 
the costs associated with excess occupancy income are based on the actual square footage available for lease to third parties  which was approximately for each of the years ended september   and the increase in excess occupancy income for the year ended september  as compared to the years ended september  and was primarily due to an early termination of a lease during the fourth fiscal quarter of amortization of identifiable intangible assets change change amortization of identifiable intangible assets software amortization of identifiable intangible assets other total amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of intangible assets software mainly relates to developed and purchased technology related to our mobile products and is reflected in direct costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization of intangible assets other relates to all other intangibles  including customer lists  and is reflected in operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents amortization of identifiable intangible assets software and amortization of identifiable intangible assets other remained relatively consistent for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  amortization of identifiable intangible assets software increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  due to the amortization of an intangible asset purchased from fonjax in fiscal year  which was placed in service in fiscal year amortization of identifiable intangible assets other decreased by million for year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal year the identifiable intangible assets will be fully amortized by fiscal year see note to our consolidated financial statements for the schedule of future amortization charges 
at september   the type and net carrying amount of the identifiable intangible assets was as follows type of identifiable intangible asset net carrying value technology based software customer based trademark covenant backlog total we annually review our goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
based on our reviews  we have not recorded an impairment charge in the fiscal years  and interest income and other income expense  net change change interest income other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net other income expense  net primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest expense 
interest income and other income expense  net decreased million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  primarily due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  partially offset by increased interest income on higher invested cash balances 
interest income and other income expense  net decreased million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances 
other income expense  net decreased primarily due to less favorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year benefit provision for income taxes change change benefit provision for income taxes 
table of contents our tax rate differed from the statutory rate in each of the years primarily due to nondeductible stock based compensation charges  foreign tax differential  amortization of prepaid tax asset and the change in our valuation allowance 
based on our history of earnings over the three years ended september  and our forecasted profitability  we believe that million of our net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we released million of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which was the primary reason for the difference from the statutory rate in fiscal year based on current facts and circumstances  we believe that our united states operations have achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in fiscal year and beyond to support the release of the valuation allowance 
however  if assumptions on our future performance prove to be incorrect and we are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets  we may have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance 
we had net operating loss carryforwards at september  for federal income tax purposes of million  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  through tax year in addition  we had million of net operating loss carryforwards at september  available to reduce future taxable income for state income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  through tax year california has enacted legislation that suspends the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards for tax years and this legislation has already increased and may increase in the future our tax liability 
as of september   we had research credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for state income tax purposes individually available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in tax year the california research credit carryforwards have no expiration date 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at september  it is our intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries  except for our subsidiary in the united kingdom which was merged out of existence in fiscal year if we distribute these earnings  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both united states income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign jurisdiction 
in connection with merger of the united kingdom subsidiary into our netherlands subsidiary  the united kingdom subsidiary declared a dividend to us in the amount of the excess cash held by the subsidiary at the date of its dissolution 
as of september   a deferred tax liability has been provided for million of undistributed earnings associated with the dividend from the united kingdom subsidiary 
federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that the net operating losses and research and development credits acquired through the acquisition of two of our subsidiaries are subject to section limitations  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an additional ownership change occurs  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense  which is included in total costs and expenses by category  remained relatively consistent for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended 
table of contents september  stock based compensation expense decreased million for the year ended september  as compared to year ended september  primarily due to the cancellation of options by our ceo in march  for which the remaining stock based compensation expense was accelerated and recorded in fiscal year stock based compensation related to employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as follows direct costs of revenue development operations sales and marketing general and administrative total non gaap financial measures and other operational data we also consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share  adjusted ebitda  free cash flow and gross deferred revenue  and other operational data in managing and measuring the performance of our business 
the non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
however  we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
therefore  these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share non gaap net income is calculated by adjusting gaap net income loss for the provision for income taxes  cash taxes paid net of refunds  stock based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangibles 
non gaap net income per share is calculated by dividing non gaap net income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period

net deferred revenue  which is presented in our balance sheets  is gross deferred revenue less unpaid deferred revenue 
unpaid deferred revenue is 
table of contents any gross deferred revenue that has an associated accounts receivable balance at the balance sheet date 
as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition  site revenue  excluding maintenance  is recognized upon the later of delivery or customer acceptance rather than ratably over the maintenance period 
accordingly  deferred revenue decreased in fiscal year and should continue to decrease as the remaining deferred revenue for arrangements entered into prior to fiscal year is ratably recognized 
the following table details our calculation of gross deferred revenue net deferred revenue unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue liquidity and capital resources september  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments accounts receivable  net working capital days sales in accounts receivable dso dso for the fourth fiscal quarter is calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales for the three month period multiplied by number of days in the quarter days sales outstanding increased by days from september  to september  the increase is due to extended terms granted primarily to international customers in countries that customarily have longer payment terms compared to domestic customers and to the timing of final billing on accepted engagements 
during the period  our customers payment history remained consistent with prior periods and granted payment terms 
over the past several periods  our customers have requested extended payment terms 
we expect this trend for extended terms to continue 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  for a total of million 
cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  money market funds and fixed term deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of fixed term deposits with original maturities longer than three months and investment grade corporate and government debt securities with moody ratings of a or better 
as of september   million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was held in the united states 
the remainder of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries 
if these foreign cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to additional united states income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
in october  we used approximately million in cash to close the acquisition of deviceanywhere 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers 
payments from subscription services customers are generally collected either at the beginning of the subscription period or monthly during the life of the subscription period 
payments for our systems licenses are generally collected after customer acceptance of the site system 
payments for our engagement services are generally collected after completion of the service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of operating cash flow is for personnel related expenditures  measurement and data collection infrastructure costs  insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses associated with operating our business 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash provided was mainly due to net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities and a million net decrease in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash adjustments consist primarily of deferred tax assets  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expenses and amortization of debt instruments purchase discount or premium 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of higher revenue  a decrease in deferred revenue of million and an increase in inventories of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease of prepaids  deferred costs and other assets of million 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash provided was mainly due to net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash adjustments consist primarily of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expenses  amortization of debt instruments  and deferred tax benefit 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows related to investing activities consist primarily of purchases  sales and maturities of investments and purchases of property  equipment and software to support our growth  to expand and improve our monitoring infrastructure and to make tenant improvements associated with space we lease in our headquarters building 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by our investing activities was million 
we received million from maturities and sales of short term investments and paid million for the purchase of short term investments 
we also purchased million of property  equipment  and software 
for the year ended september   net cash used by our investing activities was million 
we paid million for the purchase of short term investments  and received million from maturities and sales of short term investments 
we also purchased million of property  equipment  and software 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments of common stock dividends and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was million 
we received million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by common stock dividends of million 
for the year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was million 
we received million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by common stock dividends of million 
commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of million in real property and equipment operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through october additionally  we had million of contingent commitments to bandwidth and co location providers 
these contingent commitments have a remaining life of between one to thirty two months and become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to purchase equipment and other assets to support our growth 
the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases contingent commitments bandwidth and co location total the table above does not include unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are unable to estimate the timing or amount of the settlement of these uncertain income tax benefits 
as of september   we have outstanding guarantees totaling million to customers and vendors of one of our foreign subsidiaries 
these guarantees can only be executed upon agreement by both the customer or vendor and us 
these guarantees were secured by a million unsecured line of credit 
we generally do not indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring  quality assurance and testing services against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that could subject us to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  cash dividends  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the 
table of contents value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  our existing cash  short term investments and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business may be harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance  which eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update  which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we have not and currently do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  particularly since most of our short term investments are invested in debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change 
table of contents immediately and uniformly by ten percent from their current levels  the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by million on an annualized basis 
foreign currency fluctuations we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
a majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in united states dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
as a result  our united states dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and the british pound  totaled million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we currently do not hedge or enter into currency exchange contracts against foreign currency exposures
