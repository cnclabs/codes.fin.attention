item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august  fiscal year  august  fiscal year  and august  fiscal year included in item of this report 
overview in fiscal year  we generated revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our luby s cafeteria branded restaurants located throughout texas and three other states and fuddruckers restaurants  koo koo roo restaurants and fuddruckers franchises located throughout the us on july   we became a multi brand restaurant company with a national footprint through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 
the fuddruckers acquisition added company operated restaurants and a franchise network of franchisee operated units 
this acquisition further expanded our family friendly  value oriented portfolio of restaurants located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
in addition to our restaurant business model  we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities  colleges and universities  as well as businesses and institutions 
in fiscal years and  we continued to operate and compete  like many restaurant companies  in a slowly improving  albeit challenging economic  environment with customers seeking the most value for their dollar when they choose to dine away from home 
much of our focus during fiscal year centered around two goals to quickly integrate fuddruckers restaurants into our organization and improve selected fuddruckers facilities and processes in order to establish a base from which we can build and thus maximize the return on this investment 
this included joint efforts with the business owners of the units in the franchise network 
we also developed a new prototype for the fuddruckers brand  built a fuddruckers express in one of our cafeteria units  tested the first ever fuddruckers drive through at one unit  as well as tested various menu item upgrades  new menu options  new menu boards and installed exterior marquees to catch the attention of our customers and to continue our at both of our restaurant brands to attract customers into our restaurants by redoubling our local store marketing initiatives and local community involvement 
at our cafeteria units  we continued developing store specific menu offerings and limited time offers such as steak and shrimp on friday and saturday nights at select units  and entr e portions of our customer favorites luby s fried fish and chicken fried steak at lunch  and all you can eat lunch or dinner buffets in certain locations 
we also rolled out our all you can eat breakfast buffets at a majority of our cafeteria locations  which significantly contributed to our year over year growth in customer count at our luby s cafeteria units 
with the pressure of higher food commodity prices and impact on profit margins  we made modest price increases at both of our restaurant brands in the middle of fiscal year while continuing to offer excellent value to our guests 
at the cafeteria units  some of these price increases reflected scaling back on some limited time offers at certain points during the year and certain daytimes during the week 
the net result was an increase in same store sales of at our cafeteria units 
the sales increase at the cafeterias represented growth in customer count offset by a net decrease in average customer spend modest price increases made mid year only partially recovered price reductions made in the prior year 
at our fuddruckers restaurants  the sales growth represented growth in both customer counts and to a lesser extent an increase in average customer spend 
our goal in fiscal year will be to continue to balance the trade off between customer growth and average customer spend 
we will continue to seek to increase customer frequency by marketing quality offerings and building long term brand loyalty 
capital spending increased to million in fiscal year from the suppressed levels of fiscal year we continue to maintain the attractiveness of our luby s cafeteria units and the fuddruckers units that we acquired in july  having made various upgrades to these locations in the past fiscal year 
in fiscal  we 
table of contents anticipate increasing our capital spending to between million and million  primarily for the remodeling of existing units and the construction of new restaurant units 
in this challenging economic environment  our strong balance sheet has allowed us to capitalize on the opportunity to increase the size of our revolving credit facility and acquire substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers in july since the acquisition  we have sold eight properties that were closed during or before our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan announced in october as a result  we have been able to use the proceeds from these property sales and cash generated from operations to aggressively pay down our debt balance to million by the end of fiscal year  representing over a reduction in our outstanding debt balance 
fiscal review same store restaurant sales at our luby s cafeteria units increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year same store sales increased in the first three quarters in the fiscal year and turned slightly negative in the fourth quarter  compared to a relatively strong fourth quarter when we significantly increased our use of limited time offers to generate customer traffic and sales 
our increase in sales in fiscal year was generated by customer traffic growth  in large part due to our weekend breakfast offering  but at a lower overall ticket average 
fiscal year represents our first full year of same store sales growth since fiscal year net income from continuing operations improved from a loss of million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year to a profit from continuing operations of million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year fiscal year net income improved by million year over year 
this profitability improvement was the result of the inclusion of a full year of results from fuddruckers and growing sales in each of our brands  combined with careful cost management and operational focus 
the following provides a brief summary of selected expenses food costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in food costs as a percentage of sales was driven primarily by higher food commodity costs  an increased impact from beef commodities due to the inclusion of the fuddruckers units  and our ability to only partially pass along these higher food costs in the form of menu price increases 
payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales declined primarily due to the inclusion of the fuddruckers units  which generally operated at a lower labor costs due to the lower complexity of operations when compared to our cafeteria units 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  payroll and related costs improved basis points in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a percentage of restaurant sales  other operating expenses increased basis points 
the higher operating expenses as percentage of sales reflect the higher aggregate occupancy costs of the fuddruckers restaurants due to the greater mix of leased properties over owned properties 
as the fuddruckers units were incorporated into our operations  we also incurred higher repairs and maintenance costs to improve the appearance and operations of selected restaurants 
depreciation expense increased million and reflects primarily the addition of fuddruckers assets  partially offset by lower depreciation of our cafeteria assets 
general and administrative expenses increased by million reflecting primarily incremental corporate staffing and related expenses to support the addition of the company operated fuddruckers units as well as the network of franchise restaurants 
fiscal year also included approximately million in professional fees and integration expenses related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 

table of contents income taxes reflected a valuation allowance decrease of million in fiscal year income from continuing operations of approximately per share 
our culinary contract services ccs business continued to grow through the net addition of four new locations 
we view this area as a growth business that generally requires less capital investment and more favorable percentage returns on invested capital 
our culinary contract services business generated million in sales during fiscal year compared to million in sales during fiscal year in fiscal year  we spent million on capital expenditures  which primarily represented maintaining the attractiveness and efficiency of our restaurant units 
during fiscal year  we added leasehold improvements at a new fuddruckers location in downtown houston and at a relocated luby s restaurant in west houston 
we also acquired the assets at one former franchise location  including a building on a ground lease and the related furniture  fixtures and equipment 
our long term plan continues to focus on expanding both of our brands  including the fuddruckers franchise network  as well as growing our ccs business 
we are also committed to reducing debt through sales of properties where we have closed restaurants as well as using cash flow from operations 
we believe our operational execution has improved through our commitment to higher operating standards  and we believe that we are well positioned to enhance shareholder value over the long term 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
accordingly  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
however  every fifth or sixth year  we have a fiscal year that consists of weeks  accounting for days in the aggregate  fiscal year was such a year 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
however  the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the additional week  consisted of three four week periods and one five week period  accounting for weeks  or days  in the aggregate 
fiscal years and both contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies

on a same store store basis  restaurant sales at the luby s cafeteria restaurants increased 
the improved same store sales is primarily due to improving economic conditions and our focus on local restaurant marketing efforts and limited time offers used to generate customer traffic as well as the contribution from offering breakfast on the weekends in the majority of our cafeteria restaurants in fiscal year the prior year results of restaurants closed as part of our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan the plan have been reclassified to discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents were primarily affected by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers and the related financing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended august  and the related borrowing under our credit facility and the macroeconomic conditions that affected our fiscal year cash flow from operations 
although current macroeconomic conditions continue to affect our cash flows from operations  fiscal year cash flow from operations were favorably impacted by the acquired fuddruckers assets as well as increased revenue and related cash flow from luby s cafeterias units 
proceeds from disposal of assets and property held for sale and our capital expenditures were significantly higher in fiscal year than fiscal year  and we plan to continue the level of capital expenditures necessary to keep our restaurants attractive and operating efficiently 
our cash requirements consisted principally of payments to reduce our debt  capital expenditures for culinary contract services development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital primarily for our company owned restaurants and ccs agreements 
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers in fiscal year required us to amend and utilize our revolving credit facility 
cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets allowed for debt repayments 
under the current terms of our revolving credit facility  as amended through august   capital expenditures and the amount of borrowings are limited based on our ebitda  as defined in the credit 
table of contents agreement  as amended  governing the revolving credit facility 
based upon our level of past and projected capital requirements  we expect that proceeds from the sale of assets and cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
however  higher levels of accounts receivable are typical for culinary contract services and franchises 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease is due to cash used in financing activities of million  offset by cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by investing activities of million

financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in debt as a result of the acquisition of substantially all the assets of fuddruckers 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal year was million  primarily due to reducing the debt from million at august  to million at august  status of long term investments and liquidity at august   we did not hold any long term investments 
the securities we previously held were long term municipal bonds with underlying maturities in years through these bonds historically had short term features intended for the investor s liquidity 
prior to the collapse of the auction rate securities market in february  these bonds were purchased or sold through a dutch auction process in short term intervals of  or days  whereby the interest rate on the security was reset 
in october  the company sought relief from the illiquid investments and by filing for arbitration against its broker with financial industry regulatory authority finra dispute resolution  inc and submitting a statement of claim for the par value of the auction rate securities 
the arbitration hearing took place in april  and a final award was announced on may  in our favor whereby the broker was ordered to purchase the auction rate securities at par value 
in june  we received million from the sale of the securities to the broker at par including interest 
as a result of the sale of these securities  we recognized a million net gain in fiscal year and an other than temporary impairment loss of million in fiscal year for additional information  see note  investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
given our current cash position  expected proceeds from the sale of assets  expected future cash flow from operations and our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  we believe sufficient liquidity exists for management to achieve its operating goals for the next twelve months 
status of trade accounts and other receivables  net we monitor the aging of our receivables  including fuddruckers franchising related receivables  and record provisions for uncollectability as appropriate 
credit terms of accounts receivable associated with our culinary contract services business vary from to days based on contract terms

capital expenditures for fiscal year were approximately million and related to recurring maintenance of our existing units  to improvement of our culinary contract services business and the development of future restaurant sites 
we expect to be able to fund all capital expenditures in fiscal year using proceeds from the sale of assets  cash flows from operations and our available credit 
we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in fiscal year debt revolving credit facility in november  we entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and amegy bank  national association  as syndication agent

pappas  our president and chief executive officer  and harris j 
pappas  a member of our board of directors  guaranteed the payment of up to million of our indebtedness under the credit facility 
the maximum amount of this guaranty was reduced to million on february   further reduced to million on may  and finally reduced to zero as of august  at any time throughout the term of the credit facility  we have the option to elect one of two bases of interest rates 
one interest rate option is the greater of a the federal funds effective rate plus  or b prime  plus  in either case  an applicable spread that ranges from to per annum 
the other interest rate option is the london interbank offered rate plus a spread that ranges from to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option is dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date 
we are obligated to pay to the administrative agent for the account of each lender a quarterly commitment fee based on the average daily unused amount of the commitment of such lender  ranging from to per annum depending on the total leverage ratio at the most recent determination date 

table of contents the proceeds of the credit facility are available for our general corporate purposes and general working capital purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to mandatory repayment with the proceeds of sales of certain of our real property  subject to certain exceptions 
the credit facility is secured by a perfected first priority lien on certain of our real property and all of the material personal property owned by us or any of our subsidiaries  other than certain excluded assets as defined in the credit agreement 
at august   the carrying value of the collateral securing the credit facility was million 
the credit agreement contains the following covenants among others the maintenance of ebtida of not less than  for the fiscal quarter ended august    for the fiscal quarter ended november    for the fiscal quarter ended february    for the fiscal quarter ended may  and  for the fiscal quarter ended august  maintenance of a ratio of a ebitda for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to b the sum of x interest expense as defined in the credit agreement for such four fiscal quarter period plus y the outstanding principal balance of the loans as of the last day of such fiscal quarter divided by seven the debt service coverage ratio  of not less than to  beginning with the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and ending with the first quarter of fiscal  to beginning with the end of the second quarter of fiscal and ending with the first quarter of fiscal  and to beginning with the end of second quarter of fiscal and thereafter  maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit amendment at all times of not less than million as of the last day of the third fiscal quarter of fiscal and increasing incrementally thereafter  as of the last day of each subsequent fiscal quarter  by an amount equal to of our consolidated net income if positive for the fiscal quarter ending on such date  maintenance of minimum net profit of for at least one of the first three fiscal quarters of our fiscal year  for at least one of any two consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of our fiscal year  and for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the four consecutive fiscal years ending with the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  restrictions on incurring indebtedness  including certain guarantees and capital lease obligations  restrictions on incurring liens on certain of our property and the property of our subsidiaries  restrictions on transactions with affiliates and materially changing our business  restrictions on making certain investments  loans  advances and guarantees  restrictions on selling assets outside the ordinary course of business  prohibitions on entering into sale and leaseback transactions  limiting capital expenditures as defined in the credit agreement to million for the fiscal year ended august   to million for the fiscal year ended august   and for any subsequent fiscal year  to the sum of the lesser of a million or b an amount equal to of ebitda for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any unused availability for capital expenditures from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
restrictions on certain acquisitions of all or a substantial portion of the assets  property and or equity interests of any person 

table of contents we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement as of august  to comply with our quarterly minimum ebitda covenant for the fiscal quarter ended november   however  we requested and received approval from the lenders to add to ebitda non recurring expenses  as defined  related to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 
the definition of ebitda in the credit agreement permits us to make adjustments to ebitda for certain non recurring expenses  as defined  or income items  among others  subject to the approval of the administrative agent 
if we had not received approval to adjust our ebitda  we would not have been in compliance with the minimum ebitda covenant as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal although we expected to meet the requirements of the minimum ebitda covenant in the future  noncompliance could have had a material adverse affect on our financial condition and would have represented an event of default under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary events of default 
if a default occurs and is continuing  the lenders commitments under the credit facility may be immediately terminated and or we may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
as of august   we had million in outstanding loans and million committed under letters of credit  which were issued as security for the payment of insurance obligations 
first amendment to revolving credit facility on march   we amended the revolving credit facility as follows reduced the aggregate amount of the lenders commitments from million to million 
the amounts available under the revolving credit facility  as amended by amendment no 
thereto the amended facility  may still be increased by up to million  subject to certain terms and conditions  for a maximum total facility size of million 
modified the restriction on capital expenditures in fiscal years through june  in the original revolving credit facility  capital expenditures were limited to the extent of our annual four quarter rolling ebitda plus of the unused availability for capital expenditures from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we revised the level of spending allowed for capital expenditures by creating a floor of million 
the amount of agreed capital expenditures will be the greater of million in each fiscal year  or the amount of of the preceding fiscal year s ebitda  plus  in either case  all of the unused availability for capital expenditures from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
modified the interest rate margins to a range of to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option continues to be dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date 
amended the quarterly commitment fee  which is dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda  to a range of to per annum 
we also will continue to pay quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we were obligated to pay the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the amended facility 
in the original revolving credit facility  we were permitted to invest in any auction rate securities rated aaa by moody s or aaa by s p 
because the ratings of our auction rate securities have dropped below these thresholds  the amended facility now limits these types of investments to a specific list of auction rate securities which we hold 
modified certain financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio from not less than to not less than and the debt to ebitda ratio from not greater than to not greater than 
the amended facility also amends the interest coverage ratio calculation to now include one fifth of the principal balance of the loans in the denominator 
the amended facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities  asset sales  letters of credit  and acquisitions  and contains customary events of default 

table of contents quarterly commitment fee  which is dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda  amended to a range of to per annum 
we also continue to pay quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we were obligated to pay the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the amended facility 
revolving credit facility on july   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and amegy bank  national association  as syndication agent 
the revolving credit facility may  subject to certain terms and conditions  be increased once by an amount up to million for a maximum total facility size of million 
the revolving credit facility allowed for up to million of the available credit to be extended in the form of letters of credit 
all amounts owed by us under the revolving credit facility were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and must be repaid in full upon the maturity date on june  we amended the revolving credit facility on march   as described above under first amendment to revolving credit facility 
at any time throughout the term of the facility  we had the option to elect one of two bases of interest rates 
one interest rate option was the greater of a the federal funds effective rate plus  or b prime  plus  in either case  an applicable spread that ranges from zero to per annum 
the other interest rate option was the london interbank offered rate plus a spread that ranges from to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option was dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date 
we paid a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused available balance of the revolving credit facility  which was also dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda  ranging from to per annum 
we also paid quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we paid the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility 
commitments and contingencies off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases for our corporate office  facility service warehouse and certain restaurant properties 
claims certain current and former hourly restaurant employees filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the southern district of texas alleging violations of the fair labor standards act with respect to the inclusion of certain employees in a tip pool 
the lawsuit sought back wages  penalties and attorney s fees and was conditionally certified as a collective action in october on october   we agreed to a court settlement amount of million  recognized in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter fiscal year we made related payments of million as of august   as required by the settlement 
per the settlement  all claims had to be filed by august  therefore  the settlement is complete and we recognized a million reduction in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year from time to time  we are subject to various other private lawsuits  administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
a number of these lawsuits  proceedings and claims may exist at any given time 
these matters typically involve claims from guests  employees and others related to issues common to the restaurant industry 
we currently believe that the final disposition of these types of lawsuits  proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
it is possible  however  that our future results of operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to lawsuits  proceedings or claims 

table of contents construction activity from time to time  we enter into non cancelable contracts for the construction of our new restaurants 
this construction activity exposes us to the risks inherent in new construction including but not limited to rising material prices  labor shortages  delays in getting required permits and inspections  adverse weather conditions  and injuries sustained by workers 
contractual obligations at august   we had contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as described below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt operating lease obligations a uncertain tax positions liability b total amount of commitment by expiration period other commercial commitments total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in thousands letters of credit a operating lease obligations contain rent escalations and renewal options ranging from one to thirty years 
b the  of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities 
the timing and amounts of future cash payments related to these liabilities are uncertain 
in addition to the commitments described above  we enter into a number of cancelable and noncancelable commitments during each fiscal year 
typically  these commitments expire within one year and are generally focused on food inventory 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase products from any single supplier 
substantially all of our product purchase commitments are cancelable up to days prior to the vendor s scheduled shipment date 
long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of august  included amounts accrued for benefit payments under our supplemental executive retirement plan of million  accrued insurance reserves of million and deferred rent liabilities of million

pappas  who is a director of luby s  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  management will evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits of such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law 

table of contents at the end of fiscal year  the company had total deferred tax assets of approximately million 
however  based on management s analysis of whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary at the end of fiscal year the decision was based on the large loss sustained from continuing operations for the year  the closure of many underperforming restaurants  and the tax net operating loss reported on the company s current year and prior year federal income tax returns 
even though management had implemented a plan to improve cash flow and redeploy capital  the circumstances did not provide evidence that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
therefore  a valuation allowance was established to partially offset the company s federal net operating loss nol carryovers to future years and the company s carryover of federal general business tax credits 
at the end of the following fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
the negative evidence was that again the company experienced a loss from continuing operations and would report a net operating loss for federal income taxes 
on the positive side  however  the loss for the year was significantly less than in the prior year and expectations were that the improvements would continue 
also  the company acquired substantially all the assets of fuddruckers at the end of fiscal year with expectations of additional operational income in the future 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary 
the valuation allowance partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of federal general business tax credits and other credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  was reported as part of the tax benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company will report another net operating loss on the federal income tax return 
the positive evidence was that the company earned income from continuing operations for the year 
this has been a significant improvement over the last two years and indicates the company s cash flow and capital redeployment plan may be working 
even though there were losses in the two prior years  management is more confident that the integration of fuddruckers and improvements in other operations will provide future revenue to allow the utilization of the deferred tax assets 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary 
the valuation allowance partially offsets our carryover of federal general business tax credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  is reported as part of the tax expense included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year two of the most significant items included in deferred tax assets are nol carryovers and general business tax credits 
both of these items may be carried over up to twenty years in the future for possible utilization in the future 
nol amounts carryover beginning in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through fiscal year  if not utilized by then 
the carryover of general business tax credits and other credits were also impacted by amended federal returns  and subsequent to these filings  general business tax credit amounts carryover beginning in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through  if not utilized by then 
the valuation allowance amounts as of fiscal year and partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of general business tax credits 
the valuation allowance as of fiscal year partially offset only our carryover of general business tax credits since a valuation allowance on our nol 
table of contents carryovers is no longer necessary  as these assets are more likely than not to be fully realized 
considering continuing operational performance and forecasted taxable income projections  management anticipates the nol carryovers as of the fiscal year ended august  to be realized within five years subsequent 
the partial reversals of the valuation allowance amounts in fiscal years and  were based upon continued improvement in current and projected operational performance  ability to utilize nol amounts through carryforward and carryback  as well as recent sustained losses from continuing operations 
this positive and negative evidence was weighed  and in each year an increasing portion of our deferred tax assets were determined to be realizable  on a more likely than not basis  with a valuation allowance provided for these amounts 
the reductions of the valuation allowance in fiscal years and are reported as part of the income tax expense or benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for the year 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to examination in these tax jurisdictions  as well as by the internal revenue service irs 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open income tax periods 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets held for use and held for sale  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations and compare results of poorer performing locations to more profitable locations 
we also analyze lease terms  condition of the assets and related need for capital expenditures or repairs  construction activity in the surrounding area as well as the economic and market conditions in the surrounding area 
for assets held for use  we estimate future cash flows using assumptions based on possible outcomes of the areas analyzed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of our location s assets  we record an impairment based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
assumptions and estimates used include operating results  changes in working capital  discount rate  growth rate  anticipated net proceeds from disposition of the property and if applicable  lease terms 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity to assumptions made 
the time span is longer and could be to years for newer properties  but only to years for older properties 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows 
we operated restaurants as of november  and periodically experience unanticipated changes in our assumptions and estimates 
those changes could have a significant impact on discounted cash flow models with a corresponding significant impact on the measurement of an impairment 
we believe we have one location with an aggregate net carrying value of assets in use of million where it is reasonably possible for an impairment charge to be taken over the next months 
gains are not recognized until the assets are disposed 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements to determine if they are definite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination of useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  contract term  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

table of contents investments investments included available for sale securities  classified as long term and reported at fair value 
securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities 
declines in fair value of available for sale securities were analyzed to determine if the decline was temporary or other than temporary 
temporary unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were excluded from earnings and reported in shareholders equity 
other than temporary declines reduce earnings 
increases in other than temporary declines in fair value realized until the securities were sold 
property held for sale we periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we analyze market conditions each reporting period and record additional impairments due to declines in market values of like assets 
the fair value of the property is determined by observable inputs such as appraisals and prices of comparable properties in active markets for assets like ours 
gains are not recognized until the properties are sold 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods 
share based compensation share based compensation is recognized as compensation expense in the income statement utilizing the fair value on the date of the grant 
the fair value of restricted stock units is valued at the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
assumptions for volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield are used in the model 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements topic which amends the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the amendment is effective during interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic which requires companies to present total comprehensive income and its components and the components of net income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and comprehensive income 
this requirement eliminates the option to present components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
this guidance affects only the presentation of comprehensive income and does not change the components of comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on a retrospective basis 
we do not expect that the adoption of this accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplemental pro forma information for business combinations 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation it is generally our policy to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
certain increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our variable rate debt 
as of august   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our amended new credit facility was million 
assuming an average debt balance of million  a increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million 
although we are not currently using interest rate swaps  we have previously used and may in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion of our variable rate debt 
many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
