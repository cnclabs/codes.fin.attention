item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of forward looking statements about the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company will require a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness  fund capital expenditures and retire portions of its notes  and its ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under the first amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement dated september  the first amended credit agreement 
the company s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness  to fund planned capital expenditures and to redeem portions of the notes under its deleveraging strategy will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
the business may not generate cash flows from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to the company in an amount sufficient to enable the company to pay its indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow or borrowings  the company may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital investments or redemptions of the notes under the deleveraging strategy or seek to raise additional capital 
the company may not be able to implement one or more of these alternatives on terms that are acceptable or at all 
the terms of its existing or future debt agreements may restrict the company from adopting any of these alternatives 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flows or to achieve any of these alternatives could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
in addition  without such refinancing  the company could be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in its payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances 
the company s first amended credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes dated may  between the company and its subsidiary guarantors and us bank  national association  as trustee the indenture limit its ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from any such sale 
furthermore  the notes and the first amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of its assets 
therefore  the company may not be able to sell its assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable the company to meet its debt service obligations 
the company s future operating results  deteriorating conditions in the credit markets  declining credit ratings or abnormally high interest rates or other adverse debt instrument terms could make it difficult for the company to refinance its indebtedness on favorable terms or at all when it comes due 
the company s ability to refinance its indebtedness on favorable terms or at all will depend on its ability to generate adequate operating results in the future  the prevailing conditions of the credit markets  the company s credit agency debt ratings  and interest rate and other debt instrument terms available in the credit markets at the time the company refinances its indebtedness 
the notes are due and payable in may outstanding amounts under the first amended credit agreement are due and payable in september  however  if the notes have not been paid in full on or before february   the maturity date of the company s revolving credit facility will be automatically adjusted to february  if the company were unable to refinance its indebtedness on a timely basis  it could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company relies on accurate financial reporting information from equity method investees that it does not control 
errors in financial reporting by these equity method investees could be material to the company and cause it to have to restate past financial statements 
the company has ownership interests in equity method investees that it does not control 
the company relies on accurate financial reporting information from these entities for preparation of its quarterly and annual financial statements 
errors in the financial reporting information received by the company from any of these equity method investees could be material to the company and require it to have to restate past financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
such restatements  if they occur could have a material adverse effect on the company or the market price of its securities 
the company faces intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign yarn producers and importers of textile and apparel products 
the company s industry is highly competitive 
the company competes not only against domestic and foreign yarn producers  but also against importers of foreign sourced fabric and apparel into the us and other countries in which the company does business 
the company anticipates that competitor expansions or new competition within these regions may lead to reduced industry utilization rates that could result in reduced gross profit margins for the company s products  which may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  petrobras petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras  a public oil company controlled by the brazilian government  announced the construction of a polyester manufacturing complex located in the northeast sector of the country 
this new investment in polyester capacity is made by petrobras through its wholly owned subsidiary  petrosuape companhia petroquimica de pernambuco petrosuape 
petrosuape will produce pta  polyethylene terephthalate pet resin  polyester chip  poy and textured polyester 
construction on various phases of the project has commenced 
once operational  the textured polyester operations of petrosuape will most likely be a significant competitor 
the textured polyester operations of petrosuape are expected to have approximately twice the capacity of the company s brazilian subsidiary  unifi do brasil 
petrosuape s textured polyester operation started limited production in july and is expected to be in full commercial production by mid such significant capacity expansion may negatively affect the utilization rate of the synthetic textile filament market in brazil  thereby potentially impacting the operating results of unifi do brasil 
in addition  unifi do brasil may transfer much of its current poy purchases from imports to petrosuape poy 
such a shift will make unifi do brasil a significant customer of petrosuape s operations  however  it would likely result in unifi do brasil losing certain economic assistance benefits provided by local economic incentives 
competitive pricing from petrosuape and or efficiency gains in unifi do brasil s operations may not make up for the loss of these incentives 
a failure to make up these benefits could have a material adverse effect on unifi do brasil s and or the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the primary competitive factors in the textile industry include price  quality  product styling and differentiation  flexibility of production and finishing  delivery time and customer service 
the needs of particular customers and the characteristics of particular products determine the relative importance of these various factors 
because the company  and the supply chains in which the company operates  do not typically operate on the basis of long term contracts with textile and apparel customers  these competitive factors could cause the company s customers to rapidly shift to other producers 
a large number of the company s foreign competitors have significant competitive advantages  including lower labor costs  lower raw materials and favorable currency exchange rates against the us dollar 
if any of these advantages increase  the company s products could become less competitive  and its sales and profits may decrease as a result 
in addition  while traditionally these foreign competitors have focused on commodity production  they are now increasingly focused on value added products  where the company continues to generate higher margins 
the company  and the supply chains in which the company operates  may not be able to continue to compete effectively with imported foreign made textile and apparel products  which would materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
an increase of illegal transshipments of textile and apparel goods into the us could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry experts and trade associations  there has been a significant amount of illegal transshipments of apparel products into the us and such illegal transshipments continue to negatively impact the us textile market 
illegal transshipment involves circumventing quotas by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are a product of a particular country of origin or include yarn of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional ftas  such as nafta and cafta 
if illegal transshipment is not monitored and enforcement is not effective  these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as product demand flow shifts within a region the company could lose its cost competitiveness due to the location of its assets 
the company s polyester segment primarily manufactures its products in the us and el salvador 
the company s nylon segment primarily manufactures its products in colombia and the us the company s international segment primarily manufactures its products in brazil and has a sales office in china 
as product demand flow shifts within the regions in which the company does business  it could lose its cost competitiveness due to the location of its assets 
the company s operations may incur higher manufacturing  transportation and or raw material costs in its present operating locations than it could achieve should its operations be located in these new product demand centers 
this could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a decline in general economic or political conditions and changes in consumer spending could cause the company s sales and profits to decline 
the company s products are used in the production of fabric primarily for the apparel  hosiery  home furnishing  automotive  industrial and other similar end use markets 
demand for furniture and durable goods  such as automobiles  is often affected significantly by economic conditions 
demand for a number of categories of apparel also tends to be tied to economic cycles and customer preference 
domestic demand for textile products therefore tends to vary with the business cycles of the us economy as well as changes in global trade flows  and economic and political conditions 
future armed conflicts  terrorist activities  economic and political conditions or natural disasters in the us or abroad and any consequential actions on the part of the us government and others may cause general economic conditions in the us to deteriorate or otherwise reduce us consumer spending 
the global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility 
the company cannot predict when economic conditions will improve or stabilize 
a prolonged period of economic volatility or continued decline could adversely affect demand for the company s products and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a decline in general economic conditions or consumer confidence may also lead to significant changes to inventory levels and  in turn  replenishment orders placed with suppliers 
these changing demands ultimately work their way through the supply chain and could adversely affect demand for the company s products and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
also  as one of the many participants in the us and regional textile and apparel supply chains  the company s business and competitive position are directly impacted by the business and financial condition of the other participants across the supply chains in which it operates  including other regional yarn manufacturers  knitters and weavers 
if other supply chain participants are unable to access capital  fund their operations and make required technological and other investments in their businesses or experience diminished demand for their products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to implement future technological advances in the textile industry or fund capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and net sales 
the company s operating results depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce innovative products and applications and to continue to develop its production processes to be a competitive producer 
accordingly  to maintain its competitive position and its revenue base  the company must continually modernize its manufacturing processes  plants and equipment 
to this end  the company has historically made significant investments in its manufacturing infrastructure 
future technological advances in the textile industry may result in an increase in the efficiency of existing manufacturing and distribution systems or the innovation of new products and the company may not be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer such products on a timely basis if it does not incur significant capital expenditures 
existing  proposed or yet undeveloped technologies may render its technology less profitable or less viable  and the company may not have available the financial and other resources to compete effectively against companies possessing such technologies 
to the extent sources of funds are insufficient to meet its ongoing capital improvement requirements  the company would need to seek alternative sources of financing or curtail or delay capital spending plans 
the company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
the company is unable to predict which of the many possible future products and services will meet the evolving industry standards and consumer demands 
if the company fails to make future capital improvements necessary to continue the modernization of its manufacturing operations and reduction of its costs  its competitive position may suffer  and its net sales may decline 
the significant price volatility of many of the company s raw materials and rising energy costs may result in increased production costs  which the company may not be able to pass on to its customers  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a significant portion of the company s raw materials and energy costs are derived from petroleum based chemicals 
the prices for petroleum and petroleum related products and energy costs are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics  including geo political risks 
while the company enters into raw material supply agreements from time to time  these agreements typically provide index pricing based on quoted feedstock market prices 
therefore  its supply agreements provide only limited protection against price volatility 
while the company has at times in the past matched cost increases with corresponding product price increases  the company was not always able to immediately raise product prices  and  ultimately  pass on underlying cost increases to its customers 
the company has in the past lost and expects that it may continue to lose  customers to its competitors as a result of price increases 
in addition  its competitors may be able to obtain raw materials at a lower cost due to market regulations that favor local producers  and certain other market regulations that favor the company over other producers may be amended or repealed 
additional raw material and energy cost increases that the company is not able to fully pass on to customers or the loss of a large number of customers to competitors as a result of price increases could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company depends upon limited sources for raw materials  and interruptions in supply could increase its costs of production and cause its operations to suffer 
the company depends on a limited number of third parties for certain raw material supplies  such as poy and chip 
although alternative sources of raw materials exist  the company may not continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials on acceptable terms  or at all  from other sources 
the company is dependent on nafta and cafta qualified suppliers of poy which in the future may experience interruptions or limitations in the supply of its raw materials  which would increase its product costs and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these poy suppliers are also at risk with their raw material supply chains 
any disruption or curtailment in the supply of any of its raw materials could cause the company to reduce or cease its production in general or require the company to increase its pricing  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
changes in the trade regulatory environment could weaken the company s competitive position dramatically and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a number of sectors of the textile industry in which the company sells its products  particularly apparel  hosiery and home furnishings  are subject to intense foreign competition 
other sectors of the textile industry in which the company sells its products may in the future become subject to more intense foreign competition 
there are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the us textile industry against competition from low priced foreign producers  such as china 
changes in such trade regulations and duties may make its products less attractive from a price standpoint than the goods of its competitors or the finished apparel products of a competitor in the supply chain  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  increased foreign capacity and imports that compete directly with its products could have a similar effect 
furthermore  one of the company s key business strategies is to expand its business within countries that are parties to ftas with the us any relaxation of duties or other trade protections with respect to countries that are not parties to those ftas could therefore decrease the importance of the trade agreements and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the proposed korea fta is potentially problematic for various sectors of the us textile industry 
in contrast to fta s in recent years  the korea fta is the first fta since the nafta agreement where the country in question has a large  vertically integrated and developed textile sector 
duty free treatment under the proposed agreement could adversely affect the us textile and apparel industries due to concerns with transshipments and the fact that this fta would give korea a greater competitive advantage by further reducing the cost of korean products in the us the korea fta was negotiated under fast track during the bush administration  and changes to the treatment of automobiles under the fta were negotiated by the obama administration to reduce opposition in the us congress 
the obama administration has indicated it would like to introduce the bill in congress in the fall of the us textile industry continues to work with the us trade office and the administration to address its concerns with the korea fta 
the company has significant foreign operations and its results of operations may be adversely affected by the risks associated with doing business in foreign locations 
the company has operations in brazil  china  colombia  el salvador and a joint venture in israel 
the company serves customers in canada  mexico  israel and various countries in europe  central america  south america  africa  and asia 
the company s foreign operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties not encountered by its domestic operations that can materially impact the company s supply chains  or other aspects of its foreign operations 
the risks of international operations include trade barriers  duties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political unrest  general economic risks  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws  including tax laws  the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  taxes on distributions or deemed distributions to the company or any of its us subsidiaries  maintenance of minimum capital requirements and import and export controls 
through its subsidiaries  the company is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings  as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
in most jurisdictions  the company regularly has audits and examinations by the designated tax authorities  and additional tax assessments are common 
through its foreign operations  the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact period to period comparisons of its reported results 
additionally  the company operates in countries with foreign exchange controls 
these controls may limit its ability to repatriate funds from its international operations and joint ventures or otherwise convert local currencies into us dollars 
these limitations could adversely affect the company s ability to access cash from these operations 
unifi do brasil receives certain regulatory benefits through the sales of its product in brazil 
if these benefits are significantly reduced or repealed  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability and cash flows 
the company s deleveraging strategy could result in the company maintaining larger balances outstanding under its first amended credit agreement and decrease the company s excess borrowing availability  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its debt agreements 
on an ongoing basis  the company anticipates utilizing its liquidity to continue to redeem portions of its notes incrementally through a combination of internally generated cash and borrowings under the first amended credit agreement 
the company expects to maintain a continuous balance outstanding under the first amended credit agreement and to hedge a substantial amount of the interest rate risk in order to ensure its interest savings as it executes the deleveraging strategy 
the company s first amended credit agreement requires the company to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test if borrowing capacity is less than of the total credit facility 
the consummation of the redemption of the notes and implementation of the deleveraging strategy may result in the company maintaining reduced levels of excess availability under the first amended credit agreement  but not to the extent that the fixed charge coverage ratio test applies 
if the company s availability under the first amended credit agreement falls below of the total credit facility  it may not be able to maintain the required fixed charge coverage ratio 
additionally  the first amended credit agreement restricts the company s ability to make certain distributions and investments should its borrowing capacity decrease to below of the total credit facility 
these restrictions could limit the company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet its capital needs 
the company may not be granted waivers or amendments to its first amended credit agreement if for any reason the company is unable to meet its requirements  or the company may not be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to it  or at all 
the success of the company depends on the ability of its senior management team  as well as the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the company s success is highly dependent on the abilities of its management team 
the management team must be able to effectively work together to successfully conduct the company s current operations  as well as implement the company s strategies 
if it is unable to do so  the results of operations and financial condition of the company may suffer 
the failure to retain current key managers or key members of the design  product development  manufacturing  merchandising or marketing staff  or to hire additional qualified personnel for its operations could be detrimental to the company s business 
the company currently does not have any employment agreements with its corporate officers and cannot assure investors that any of these individuals will remain with the company 
the company currently does not have life insurance policies on any of the members of the senior management team 
unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of the company s facilities may cause significant lost production  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s manufacturing processes could be affected by operational problems that could impair its production capability 
each of its facilities contains complex and sophisticated machines that are used in its manufacturing processes 
disruptions at any of its facilities could be caused by maintenance outages  prolonged power failures or reductions  a breakdown  failure or substandard performance of any of its machines  the effect of noncompliance with material environmental requirements or permits  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels or roads  fires  floods  earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters  labor difficulties  or other operational problems 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of its facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights  and the company s inability to enforce these rights could cause it to lose sales and any competitive advantage it has 
the company s success depends in part upon its ability to protect and preserve its rights in its trademarks and other intellectual property it owns or licenses 
the company relies on the trademark  copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  the company may be unable to prevent third parties  employees or contractors from using its intellectual property without authorization  breaching any nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements with it  or independently developing technology that is similar to the company s property 
the use of the company s intellectual property by others without authorization may reduce any competitive advantage that it has developed  cause it to lose sales or otherwise harm its business 
the company has obtained us and foreign trademark registrations  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks  as appropriate 
the company cannot guarantee that its applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities or that third parties may not seek to oppose or otherwise challenge its registrations or applications 
a failure to obtain or maintain trademark registrations in the us and other countries could limit the company s ability to protect its trademarks and impede its marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 
the company cannot be certain that the conduct of its business does not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  or that third parties do not and will not infringe on or misappropriate its intellectual property 
the company may be subject to  or initiate  legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business  which could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of its personnel 
depending on the success of these proceedings  the company may be required to enter into licensing or consent agreements if available on acceptable terms or at all  or to pay damages or cease using certain trademarks or other intellectual property 
although its intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position  no single trademark  patent  copyright or license is  in the company s view  of such value to it that the company s business would be materially affected by the expiration  termination or infringement thereof 
failure to successfully reduce the company s production costs may adversely affect its financial results 
a significant portion of the company s strategy relies upon its ability to successfully rationalize and improve the efficiency of its operations 
in particular  the company s strategy relies on its ability to reduce its production costs in order to remain competitive 
the company has consolidated multiple unprofitable businesses and made significant capital expenditures to more completely automate its production facilities to lessen its dependence on labor and decrease waste 
if the company is not able to continue to successfully implement cost reduction measures  or if these efforts do not generate the level of cost savings that it expects going forward or result in higher than expected costs  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is currently implementing various strategic business initiatives  and the success of the company s business will depend on its ability to effectively develop and implement these initiatives 
the company is currently implementing various strategic business initiatives  including a new recycling center that improves its capability and flexibility in the production of pva yarns and vertically integrating into recycled polyester chip production for use in its repreve product offering 
the development and implementation of these initiatives requires financial and management commitments outside of day to day operations 
these commitments could have a significant impact on the company s operations and profitability  particularly if the initiatives prove to be unsuccessful 
moreover  if the company is unable to implement an initiative in a timely manner  or if those initiatives turn out to be ineffective or are executed improperly  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
the company s substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition 
the company s outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following its high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its obligations with respect to the notes  including its repurchase obligations  the restrictions imposed on the operation of its business may hinder its ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow its business  its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  the company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest on its indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to the company for operations and other purposes  its high level of indebtedness could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that may have proportionately less debt  it may be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of its borrowings  including borrowings under its first amended credit agreement  are at variable rates of interest  its cost of borrowing may increase  its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates may be limited  and its high level of indebtedness makes the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness 
despite its current indebtedness levels  the company may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with its substantial leverage 
the company and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness  including additional secured indebtedness  in the future 
the terms of its current debt restrict  but do not completely prohibit  the company from doing so 
the company s first amended credit agreement permits up to  of borrowings  which the company can request be increased to  under certain circumstances  with a borrowing base specified in the credit facility as equal to specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the indenture allows the company to issue additional notes under certain circumstances and to incur certain other additional secured debt  and allows its foreign subsidiaries to incur additional debt 
the indenture does not prevent the company from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness 
if new debt or other liabilities are added to its current debt levels  the related risks that the company now faces could intensify 
the terms of the company s outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent the company from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions 
the terms of the company s outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the company 
these restrictions will limit or prohibit  among other things  its ability to incur and guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay subordinated indebtedness prior to its stated maturity  pay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase the company s stock  issue capital stock  make certain investments or acquisitions  create liens  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates  and restrict dividends  distributions or other payments from its subsidiaries 
these restrictions could limit its ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet its capital needs 
the company may not be granted waivers or amendments to its first amended credit agreement if for any reason the company is unable to meet its requirements or the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness on terms that are acceptable to it  or at all 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture or its first amended credit agreement 
an event of default under its debt agreements would permit some of its lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable 
such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  an event of default under its first amended credit agreement would permit the lenders under the first amended credit agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that agreement 
furthermore  if the company was unable to repay the amounts due and payable under its first amended credit agreement  those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness and force the company into bankruptcy or liquidation 
in the event its lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of its borrowings  the company and its guarantor subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 
as a result of these restrictions  the company may be limited in how it conducts its business  unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns  or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 
these restrictions may affect the company s ability to grow in accordance with its plans 
the company has made and may continue to make investments in entities that it does not control 
the company has established joint ventures and made minority interest investments designed  among other things  to increase its vertical integration  increase efficiencies in its procurement  manufacturing processes  marketing and distribution in the us and other markets 
the company s inability to control entities in which it invests may affect its ability to receive distributions from those entities or to fully implement its business plan 
the incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by an entity not under its control may result in restrictions or prohibitions on that entity s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
even where these entities are not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions  the company may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of such distributions 
in addition  if any of the other investors in these entities fails to observe its commitments  that entity may not be able to operate according to its business plan or the company may be required to increase its level of commitment 
if any of these events were to occur  its business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
because the company does not own a majority or maintain voting control of these entities  the company does not have the ability to control their policies  management or affairs 
the interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from the company s  and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in the company s best interest 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its partners in these entities  the company could lose its ability to operate in these areas which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the parkdale america  llc joint venture may lose economic adjustment assistance to users of upland cotton which could adversely affect the company s investment income and cash flows 
one of the company s joint ventures  parkdale america  llc pal  receives economic adjustment payments eap from the commodity credit corporation under the economic assistance program to users of upland cotton  subpart c of the farm bill 
the program provides textile mills a subsidy of four cents per pound on eligible upland cotton consumed during the first four years and three cents per pound for the last six years of the program 
the economic assistance received under this program must be used to acquire  construct  install  modernize  develop  convert or expand land  plant  buildings  equipment  or machinery 
capital expenditures must be directly attributable to the purpose of manufacturing upland cotton into eligible cotton products in the us since august   pal has received  of economic assistance under the program 
should pal no longer meet the criteria to receive economic assistance under the program or should the program be discontinued  pal s business could be significantly impacted 
compliance with environmental and other regulations could require significant expenditures 
the company is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations that govern its activities  operations and products that may have adverse environmental  health and safety effects  including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions  water discharges  waste  product and packaging content and workplace safety 
noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions 
future events that could give rise to manufacturing interruptions or environmental remediation include changes in existing laws and regulations  the enactment of new laws and regulations  a release of hazardous substances on or from its properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or the discovery of contamination from current or prior activities at any of its properties 
while the company is not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in order to comply  any such regulations or obligations could adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows

the company subsequently completed an additional  redemption of its notes on august  at a redemption price of which was financed through borrowings under its revolving credit facility

investment in central america 
in order to more effectively service the central american market  the company began dismantling and relocating idled polyester texturing equipment from its yadkinville  north carolina facility to el salvador during the third quarter of fiscal year and completed the startup of the uca manufacturing facility in the second quarter of fiscal year this investment has resulted in a net increase of the company s texturing capacity of approximately 
the new manufacturing facility in el salvador has allowed the company to become a local supplier to the cafta region as global sourcing continues to move programs from asia as the region becomes a competitive alternative to asian supply chains for certain apparel categories 
the company expects year over year volume growth from the cafta region and is in the process of adding additional texturing capacity to its plant in el salvador to meet this future demand

on may   the company officially opened its state of the art repreve recycling center in yadkinville  north carolina increasing its investment in the commercialization of recycled pva products 
this facility is expected to improve the availability of recycled raw materials and significantly increase product capabilities and competitiveness in this growing market 
the technology installed in this operation allows the company to expand the repreve brand by increasing the amount and types of recyclable material that can be processed through its facility 
the company expects this will also make it an even stronger partner in the development and commercialization of value added products that meet the sustainability demands of today s brands and retailers 
these investments and activities are critical to achieving the company s target of doubling its pva sales within three years 
china growth 
the company s chinese subsidiary increased its net sales by approximately and its sales volumes by approximately in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  as the company continued to improve its development  sourcing  resale and servicing of pva products in the asian region 
operational excellence 
over the past year  the company expanded its efforts in lean manufacturing and statistical process control in all of its operations aiming for measurable improvements in the cost of operations 
these efforts have resulted in demonstrated savings over the last several years as well as greatly improved operational flexibility and are expected to result in continued improvement over the next several years 
inflation 
for the most recently completed fiscal year and for the foreseeable future  the company expects rising costs to continue for the consumables that it uses to produce and ship its products  as well as for its utilities and certain employee and medical costs 
while the company attempts to mitigate these rising costs through its operational efficiencies and increased selling prices  inflation may become a factor that begins to negatively impact the company s profitability 
raw materials 
the feedstock for the company s raw materials have seen significant cost increases during the past year which peaked in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  pta pricing  which is a major component of polyester  declined by in asia in the june quarter compared to the prior quarter  while it increased by in the us while the company expects the price difference to return to normal which would reverse the competitive edge that asia had in the june quarter  such dramatic increases and changes in raw material costs could negatively impact the company s operating results if sales prices cannot be adjusted in tandem with such fast or unexpected rises in cost 
brazil 
during fiscal year  on a local currency basis  the company s brazilian operation experienced approximately an decline in its gross profits on a per unit basis 
sales volumes have been negatively impacted over the prior fiscal year as market conditions weakened 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by a higher average cost of raw materials 
the brazilian operation has also been negatively impacted by increasing levels of imports of yarn  fabric and garments from asia due in part to the strengthening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
strategy 
although the company has improved its overall performance there are many challenges still ahead related to competition  inflation  raw material costs and weakness of the us and global economies 
the company believes the future success of its current business model will be based on the success of the regional free trade markets in which it trades and its ability to increase its sales of pva yarns including its repreve recycled yarns  implement cost saving strategies  pass on raw material price increases to its customers  and strategically penetrate growth markets  such as china  central america  and brazil 
the company will continue to focus on sustaining and continuously improving operations and profitability  and increasing its net sales and earnings in global markets 
the company will strive to create additional value through mix enrichment  share gain  process improvement throughout the organization  and expanding the number of customers and programs using its high value and pva yarns 
key performance indicators the company continuously reviews performance indicators to measure its success 
the following are the indicators management uses to assess performance of the company s business sales volume for the company and for each of its reportable segments  gross profits and gross margin for the company and for each of its reportable segments  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda represents net income or loss before net interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization expense  consolidated ebitda represents ebitda adjusted to exclude equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
adjusted ebitda represents consolidated ebitda adjusted to exclude restructuring charges  startup costs  non cash compensation expense net of distributions  gains or losses on extinguishment of debt  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill impairment  and other adjustments 
other adjustments include gains or losses on sales or disposals of property  plant  or equipment pp e  currency and derivative gains or losses  other non operating expenses  and the gain from sale of nitrogen credits 
the company may  from time to time  change the items included within adjusted ebitda  segment adjusted profit equals segment gross profit  less segment sg a expenses  plus segment depreciation and amortization  adjusted working capital dollars accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable and accruals and adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales are indicators of the company s production efficiency and ability to manage its inventory and receivables 
ebitda  consolidated ebitda  adjusted ebitda and segment adjusted profit are financial measurements that management uses to facilitate its analysis and understanding of the company s business operations 
management believes they are useful to investors because they provide a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance and debt service capacity of the company 
the calculation of ebitda  consolidated ebitda  adjusted ebitda  segment adjusted profit  and adjusted working capital are subjective measures based on management s belief as to which items should be included or excluded  in order to provide the most reasonable view of the underlying operating performance of the business 
ebitda  consolidated ebitda  adjusted ebitda  segment adjusted profit and adjusted working capital are not considered to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measurements and should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap

the polyester segment s new manufacturing facility in el salvador has allowed the company to participate in additional volume opportunities as global sourcing continues to move to the cafta region from asia 
the increase in weighted average selling price primarily reflects increases to recover lost conversion as raw material prices increased throughout most of the current fiscal year 
gross profit for the polyester segment increased over fiscal year on a unit basis  gross profit improved as compared to the prior year

polyester conversion on a per unit basis remained flat against the prior year despite higher levels of pva sales as increases in sales prices lagged increases in raw material costs 
total manufacturing costs increased for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and decreased on a per unit basis 
manufacturing costs were primarily unfavorably impacted by higher wage and fringe benefit costs of  packaging supplies of  utilities of  depreciation expenses of  and other fixed costs of  the increases for employee related costs are driven primarily by both the total cost per employee due to wage increases and rising medical costs and the number of employees at the new locations in el salvador and the company s recycling center 
the increases in packaging and utilities are due to increased consumption from higher capacity utilization  as well as inflation negatively impacting these input costs 
the other fixed costs primarily relate to certain uca start up costs and losses incurred during the period in which uca assets became available for use but prior to the achievement of a reasonable level of production 
the segment s variable manufacturing costs decreased by approximately on a per unit basis due to a higher capacity utilization offsetting the spending increases 
the segment s fixed manufacturing costs per unit increased approximately due to the negative effects of the start up costs and higher depreciation expenses 
the polyester segment net sales and gross profit as a percentage of total consolidated amounts were and for fiscal year compared to and for fiscal year  respectively 
outlook for the company expects to see improvements from its new recycling center and plant operations in el salvador  however  these improvements will be mitigated by the negative effects of inflation for certain consumables and utilities as well as increasing employee costs

gross profit for the nylon segment decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year total conversion dollars decreased or primarily as a result of lower sales volumes and the shift in mix 
manufacturing costs increased on a per unit basis 
during  the segment experienced a slightly lower capacity utilization rate

efforts to decrease spending for utilities and wages were unable to offset these increases 
the nylon segment net sales and gross profit  as a percentage of total consolidated amounts  were and for fiscal year compared to and for fiscal year  respectively 
outlook for for the nylon segment  volumes are expected to be flat and selling prices will move in tandem with the changes in raw material costs

the company continues to predict inflationary costs  which if not offset by manufacturing efficiencies  could negatively impact the segment s profitability

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those involving accounting estimates that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time and where different reasonable estimates or changes in the accounting estimate from quarter to quarter could materially impact the presentation of the financial statements 
the following discussion provides further information about accounting policies critical to the company and should be read in conjunction with footnote summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for losses is provided for known and potential losses arising from yarn quality claims and for amounts owed by customers 
reserves for yarn quality claims are based on historical claim experience and known pending claims 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is based on a combination of factors including the aging of accounts receivable  historical write off experience  present economic conditions such as customer bankruptcy filings within the industry and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
since losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  and the health of the textile industry  a significant level of judgment is required to arrive at the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the reserve for bad debts is established based on certain percentages applied to accounts receivable aged for certain periods of time and are supplemented by specific reserves for certain customer accounts where collection is no longer certain 
establishing reserves for yarn claims and uncollectible accounts requires management judgment and estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions it uses to assess allowance for losses 
certain unforeseen events such as a customer bankruptcy filing  could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its accounts receivable loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged accounts receivable reserve percentages would not have been material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
inventory reserves 
inventory reserves are established based on percentage markdowns applied to inventories aged for certain time periods 
specific reserves are established based on a determination of the obsolescence of the inventory and whether the inventory value exceeds amounts to be recovered through expected sales prices  less selling costs 
estimating sales prices  establishing markdown percentages and evaluating the condition of the inventories require judgments and estimates  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margins 
the company uses current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of its markdown percentages and expected sales prices 
the company believes it is unlikely that differences in actual demand or selling prices from those projected by management would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged inventory markdown percentages would not have been material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held for sale  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
estimates are required to determine the fair value  the disposal costs and the time period to dispose of the assets 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
for assets held and used  an impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
in such cases  additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of loss to be recognized 
the impairment loss is determined by the difference that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value measured by future discounted cash flows 
the analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and  where applicable  judgments associated with  among other factors  the appropriate discount rate 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of an asset s carrying value is based on several factors including  but not limited to  changes in business environment  a decline in operating cash flows or a decision to close a manufacturing facility 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and general economic conditions 
the company reviewed its long lived assets for recoverability during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows were adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
a decline in the company s forecasted cash flows would not have resulted in a failure of the undiscounted cash flow test 
impairment of investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
the company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the ability of an affiliate to sustain sufficient earnings and cash flows to justify its carrying value 
reductions in an affiliate s cash flows that are other than temporary and indicative of a loss of investment value are assessed for impairment purposes 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company determined there were no other than temporary impairments related to the carrying value of its investments 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company currently has a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the us and certain foreign subsidiaries due to negative evidence concerning the realization of those deferred tax assets in recent years 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences reverse 
management considers the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback periods  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company reviews its estimates of future taxable income on a quarterly basis to assess if the need for a valuation allowance exists 
the company continually evaluates both positive and negative evidence to determine whether and when the valuation allowance  or a portion thereof  should be released 
a release of the valuation allowance could have a material effect on earnings in the period of release 
the valuation allowance as of june  and june  was  and  respectively 
management and the board s audit committee discussed the development  selection and disclosure of all of the critical accounting estimates described above
