item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview world energy is an energy management services company that applies a combination of people  process and technology to take the complexity out of energy management and turn it into bottom line impact for the businesses  institutions and governments we serve 
we believe that energy costs can be expressed in a simple equation e p q i 
energy costs are a function of commodity price times quantity used minus any incentives realized 
we help customers optimize this equation by applying the seven levers of energy management planning  sourcing  risk management  efficiency  sustainability  incentives and monitoring 
these seven levers are supported by state of the art technology developed or licensed by the company 
we have developed three online auction platforms  the world energy exchange  the world green exchange and the world dr exchange 
on the world energy exchange  retail energy consumers commercial  industrial and governmental and wholesale energy participants utilities  electricity retailers  and intermediaries in north america listers are able to negotiate for the purchase or sale of electricity  natural gas and renewable energy resources from competing energy suppliers bidders which have agreed to participate on our auction platform 
the world energy exchange is supplemented with information about market rules  pricing trends  energy consumer usage and load profiles 
our energy management staff uses this platform to conduct auctions  analyze results  guide energy consumers through contracting  and track their contracts  sites  accounts and usage history 
the team also uses the exchange s sophisticated monitoring  triggering and messaging tools to develop  support and implement comprehensive risk management strategies for our more sophisticated clients 
in  we created the world green exchange to support company s sustainability goals as well as provide a marketplace for project developers to sell their environmental credits 
on the world green exchange  bidders and listers negotiate for the purchase or sale of environmental commodities such as recs  vers  cers and rggi allowances 
in january  we launched the world dr exchange to create an efficient  transparent and liquid marketplace to maximize incentive payments available to customers and provide a ready source of curtailment ready customers for the industry s csps 
the world dr exchange creates the industry s first online marketplace for demand response  enabling customers to source dr more efficiently and effectively bringing together curtailment service providers and energy consumers in highly structured auction events designed to yield price transparency  heighten competition  and maximize the energy consumers share of demand response revenues 
in the second half of  the company made a strategic investment in an emerging company that develops software that can determine the energy efficiency of buildings and present retrofit options ordered by return on investment 
the company intends to roll this solution out as a cornerstone of an energy efficiency practice 
on march   we filed a previously approved certificate of amendment to the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the secretary of state of delaware to i effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock at a ratio of one for ten  and ii decrease the number of authorized shares of its common stock from  to  as a result of the reverse stock split  the issued and outstanding shares of common stock were reduced on a basis of one share for every ten shares outstanding 
all of our stock related information including issued and outstanding common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase common stock  restricted stock and loss per share for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
on october   we entered into an agreement with bond capital  ltd 
bond  a strategic partner of ours  for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
pursuant to the agreement  a purchasing entity  an affiliate of bond  acquired million of our common stock at per share on november  we agreed to offer an additional million in company shares on the same terms to bond or its designee  with the price to be determined at the time of investment  through january  in the first quarter of  affiliates of bond purchased an additional  of our common stock at an average price of per share bringing the amount raised under the financing agreement to million 
in april  we filed an s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  using a shelf registration  or continuous offering  process 
under this shelf registration process  we may  from time to time  issue and sell any combination of preferred stock  common stock or warrants  either separately or in units  in one or more offerings with a maximum aggregate offering price of  including the us dollar equivalent if the public offering of any such securities is denominated in one or more foreign currencies  foreign currency units or composite currencies 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities under this shelf registration  if any  for general corporate purposes 

table of contents at our annual meeting of stockholders held on may   shareholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  effective as of may  we have significantly grown our employee base from at our initial public offering ipo in november to a high of during the second quarter of this planned investment allowed us to execute against our strategic initiatives as outlined in our ipo and has resulted in revenue growth of over to million in we aggressively invested in all of our product lines including building out a direct sales force  expanding our channel partner network  acquiring one of our largest competitors  and building our wholesale and green teams 
as we made these infrastructure investments in advance of revenue growth  our operating losses increased significantly in and these investments began to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of and the scalability inherent in our business model returned to our pre ipo levels resulting in gross margins of over and operating profits in the third and fourth quarter of we have generated positive adjusted ebitda in six of the last eight quarters including each of the last five quarters 
positive adjusted ebitda was million for the year ended december  and break even for we believe that our fixed operating cost structure will remain near current levels in the short term 
however  a portion of our total operating cost structure  including channel partner and internal commission costs  is variable in nature and will increase as revenue levels increase 
we will continue to be opportunistic and invest in our current product lines as well as new product offerings both within our existing and new product lines 
operations revenue retail electricity transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales contracted through our online auction platform from each bidder or energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the bidder and lister or energy consumer 
our commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity  rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
our contractual commission rate is negotiated with the energy consumer on a procurement by procurement basis based on energy consumer specific circumstances  including the size of auction  the effort required to organize and run the respective auction and competitive factors  among others 
once the contractual commission is agreed to with the energy consumer  all energy suppliers participating in the auction agree to that rate 
that commission rate remains fixed for the duration of the contractual term regardless of energy usage 
energy consumers provide us with a letter of authorization to request their usage history from the local utility 
we then use this data to compile a usage profile for that energy consumer that will become the basis for the auction 
this data may also be used to estimate revenue on a going forward basis  as noted below 
historically  our revenue and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are primarily due to the buying patterns of our wholesale and natural gas customers  which tend to have large  seasonal purchases during the fourth and first quarters and electricity usage having higher demand in our second and third quarters 
in addition  the activity levels on the world energy exchange can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including market prices  weather conditions  energy consumers credit ratings  the ability of suppliers to obtain financing in credit markets  and economic and geopolitical events 
to the extent these factors affect the purchasing decisions of energy consumers our future results of operations may be affected 
contracts between energy suppliers and energy consumers are signed for a variety of term lengths  with a one year contract term being typical for commercial and industrial energy consumers  and government contracts typically having two to three year terms 
as a result of recent commodity price fluctuations  where prices increased sharply in the first half of and then fell dramatically in the second half of and into  we saw our customers take advantage of what they perceived as low prices and contract for multiple year terms 
during this period we saw customers in some cases contract for four  five and even six year terms 
in the latter half of and into contract terms returned to one to three year contract lengths as tight credit markets led to reluctance by energy suppliers to lock in longer term contracts 
our revenue has grown over the last three years through new participants utilizing our world energy exchange as well as existing energy consumers increasing the size or frequency of their transactions on our exchange platform 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility  but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain bidders are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 

table of contents retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  we bill the supplier upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage is accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the energy consumer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we have received confirmation from the csp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable rto or iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for the pjm  the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to pjm by the csps and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
csps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
wholesale transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transactions environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized quarterly as revenue as auctions are completed and approved 
for all other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation associated with our auction management services  which are directly related to the development and production of the online auction and maintenance of market related data on our auction platform and monthly management fees our supply desk function  amortization of capitalized costs associated with our auction platform and acquired developed technology  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation related to sales and marketing personnel  third party commission expenses to our channel partners  travel and related expenses  amortization related to customer relationships and contracts  rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs  and general marketing costs such as trade shows  marketing materials and outsourced services 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation related to general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal  and other professional fees  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash held in the bank and notes receivable  and interest expense related to capital leases 
income tax expense benefit we did not record an income tax benefit for the years ended december   and as we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of those deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as a percent of revenue for the periods presented for the years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss interest income expense  net income tax expense benefit net loss comparison of the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  increase revenue revenue increased primarily due to increased auction activity in our retail product line and  to a lesser extent  our wholesale product line 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in our environmental commodity product line 
the retail product line increase reflects new customer wins with a concentration in the ohio electricity market as price caps expired during the year opening up the territory to competitive supply  increased gas transaction activity and further growth in our channel partner network 
our environmental commodities product line decreased slightly as continued execution under our rggi contract was offset by a decline in transaction volume due to the uncertain regulatory environment 

table of contents cost of revenue for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase cost of revenue cost of revenue was relatively flat compared to the year ended december  as increases in commission costs were substantially offset by decreases in payroll and amortization of capitalized software 
commission costs increased due to the increase in revenue 
payroll costs decreased as we continued to leverage our process and technology to drive higher volumes over our exchanges 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue decreased as revenue increased with no corresponding increase in costs 
operating expenses for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase decrease sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses the decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects general decreases in compensation and travel costs substantially offset by increases in marketing and internal and third party commission costs 
compensation and travel costs decreased primarily due to adjustments we made in our organizational structure during the third quarter of as we realigned our staffing as business and economic conditions evolved 
internal and third party commission costs increased due to the increase in revenue and marketing costs increased due to increased trade show and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the increase in revenue and  to a lesser extent  the cost decreases noted above 
the increase in general and administrative expenses related to the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to increases in compensation  investor relations and other costs 
compensation costs increased due to an increase in variable compensation resulting from our record performance  the reclassification of certain employees and the addition of certain staff in our accounting  information technology and human resources departments 
in addition  we increased our investor relations efforts in the us to capitalize on our nasdaq listing and increased our allowance for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased due to the cost increases noted above substantially offset by the increase in revenue 
interest income expense  net interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  interest income was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is due to certain capital leases maturing during the year 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to interest accrued on a note receivable related to funding of an energy efficiency and management software and services company in income tax expense we did not record an income tax benefit for the years ended december  and as we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of those deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  in the future 
net loss we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss is primarily due to the increase in revenue partially offset by increases in internal and third party commissions as well as increased investor relations costs 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  increase revenue revenue increased due to increased auction activity in all of our product lines 
the retail product line increase reflects new customer wins with a concentration in the ohio electricity market as price caps expired during the year opening up the territory to competitive supply 
revenue from our wholesale product line increased over as we grew our customer base to at december  and both new and existing customers became revenue contributors 
our environmental commodities product line nearly doubled reflecting a full year of rggi auctions in partially offsetting the retail and green product line increases was a decrease in management fee revenue resulting from the transitioning of the former energygateway customer base to a performance based  transaction fee model 
cost of revenue for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue decrease cost of revenue the decrease in cost of revenue related to the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was substantially due to decreases in employee costs and  to a lesser extent  travel costs 
at december   we had supply desk employees versus in the same period last year as we realized operating efficiencies from the integration of the energygateway operation and aligned our cost structure as business and economic conditions evolved 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue decreased due to the cost decreases noted above and the increase in revenue 
operating expenses for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue decrease sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses the decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects general decreases in compensation  promotional and travel costs substantially offset by increases in third party commission costs 
compensation and travel costs decreased primarily due to the operating efficiencies created by the integration of the energygateway operation and adjustments to our organizational structure as we realigned our staffing as business and economic conditions evolved in the latter half of promotional costs decreased as a result of transferring certain functions in house 
third party commission costs increased substantially due to the increase in revenue 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the increase in revenue and  to a lesser extent  the cost decreases noted above 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses related to the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to decreases in compliance and legal costs  a gain related to a settlement from early termination of a customer contract in and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in software expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased due to the cost decreases noted above and the increase in revenue 
interest income expense  net interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  interest income was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a lower average cash balance in as compared to  as we utilized the proceeds from our initial public offering to pursue our strategic initiatives 
income tax expense we did not record an income tax benefit for the years ended december  and as we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of those deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  in the future 

table of contents net loss we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss is primarily due to decreased operating expenses and the increase in revenue 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had no commitments for material capital expenditures 
we have identified and executed against a number of strategic initiatives that we believe are key components of our future growth  including expanding our community of listers  bidders and channel partners on our exchanges  strengthening and extending our long term relationships with government agencies  entering into other energy related markets including wholesale transactions with utilities  the emerging environmental commodities markets  and most recently our entry into the demand response market  making strategic acquisitions  and growing our direct and inside sales force 
as of december   our workforce numbered reflecting a net increase of six from the we employed at december  at december   we had professionals in our sales and marketing and account management groups  in our supply desk group and in our general and administrative group 
while we will continue to adjust our workforce as the need and or opportunity arises  we believe that our operating costs will remain at current levels in the short term 
comparison of december  to december  december  december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding working capital stockholders equity cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to positive adjusted ebitda of million and net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million 
these increases were partially offset by million of cash used in investing activities primarily related to the funding of an energy efficiency and management software and services company 
trade accounts receivable increased due to the increase in revenue during the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  days sales outstanding representing accounts receivable outstanding at december  divided by the average sales per day during the current quarter improved by days as compared to the previous year 
revenue from bidders representing or more of our revenue increased to from two bidders during the year ended december   from from a different bidder during the same period in working capital consisting of current assets less current liabilities increased  primarily due to the million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
stockholders equity increased for the year ended december  due to share based compensation of million and net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from a negative million in due to a million decrease in net loss 
cash used in investing and financing activities for the year ended december  was million primarily due to the million funding of an energy efficiency and management software and services company  which was substantially offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock 
cash provided by investing and financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million primarily due to approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock granted to employees and costs incurred in software development 
adjusted ebitda  representing net loss excluding share based compensation charges  depreciation  amortization  and net interest income expense  for the year ended december  was a positive million as compared to a negative  for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the million decrease in net loss 
please refer to the section below entitled use of non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

table of contents for the year ended december   we generated positive adjusted ebitda of million and generated cash from operating activities of million 
as of december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million of accounts receivable and total contracted backlog of million representing amounts to be recognized through from completed procurements if energy consumers use electricity at historical levels 
in addition  we have a  credit facility with svb and have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to sell approximately million of our securities subject to nasdaq and sec limitations 
as a result we believe we have adequate financial resources to continue to execute against our strategic initiatives

a non gaap financial measure refers to a numerical financial measure that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our financial statements 
in this annual report on form k  we provide adjusted ebitda as additional information relating to our operating results 
this non gaap measure excludes expenses related to share based compensation  depreciation related to our fixed assets  amortization expense related to acquisition related assets and capitalized software  interest expense on capital leases and interest income on invested funds and notes receivable 
management uses this non gaap measure for internal reporting and bank reporting purposes 
we have provided this non gaap financial measure in addition to gaap financial results because we believe that this non gaap financial measure provides useful information to certain investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance due to the following factors we believe that the presentation of a non gaap measure that adjusts for the impact of share based compensation expenses  depreciation of fixed assets  amortization expense related to acquisition related assets and capitalized software  and interest expense on capital leases provides investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and  therefore  is useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand our operating results and underlying operational trends  
table of contents although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  share based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant  then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the share based instrument  and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant  we do not acquire intangible assets on a predictable cycle 
our intangible assets relate solely to business acquisitions 
amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition  are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition  we do not regularly incur capitalized software costs 
our capitalized software costs relate primarily to the build out of our exchanges 
amortization costs are fixed at the time the costs are incurred and are then amortized over a period of several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the initial costs are incurred  we do not regularly invest in fixed assets 
our fixed assets relate primarily to computer and office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
depreciation costs are fixed at the time of purchase and are then depreciated over several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the purchase  and we do not regularly enter into capital leases 
our capital leases relate primarily to computer and office equipment 
interest expense is fixed at the time of purchase and recorded over the life of the lease and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the purchase 
we do not regularly earn interest on our cash accounts and notes receivable 
our cash is invested in us treasury funds and has not yielded material returns to date and these returns generally cannot be changed or influenced by management

accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the most judgmental estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition and the estimate of actual energy delivered from the bidder to the lister of such energy  software development costs  share based compensation  the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  and estimates of future taxable income as it relates to the realization of our net deferred tax assets

to the extent actual results differ from those estimates our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements filed herewith for a description of our accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition retail electricity transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales contracted through our online auction platform from each bidder or energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the bidder or energy supplier and lister or energy consumer 
our commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity  rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
revenue from commissions is recognized as earned on a monthly basis over the life of each contract as energy is consumed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  has been successfully demonstrated 
we record brokerage commissions based on actual usage data obtained from the energy supplier for that accounting period  or to the extent actual usage data is not available  based on the estimated amount of electricity and gas delivered to the energy consumers for that accounting period 
we develop our estimates on a quarterly basis based on the following criteria payments received prior to the issuance of the financial statements  usage updates from energy suppliers  usage data from utilities  comparable historical usage data  and historical variances to previous estimates 
to the extent usage data cannot be obtained  we estimate revenue as follows historical usage data obtained from the energy consumer in conjunction with the execution of the auction  geographic utility usage patterns based on actual data received  analysis of prior year usage patterns  and specific review of individual energy supplier location accounts 
in addition  we analyze this estimated data based on overall industry trends including prevailing weather and usage data 
once the actual data is received  we adjust the estimated accounts receivable and revenue to the actual total amount in the period during which the payment is received 
based on management s current capacity to obtain actual energy usage  we currently estimate four to six weeks of revenue at the end of our accounting period 
differences between estimated and actual revenue have been within management s expectations and have not been material to date 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain energy suppliers are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 
retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  we bill the supplier upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage are accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the customer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we have received confirmation from the csp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable rto or iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for pjm the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to pjm by the csp s and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
csps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 

table of contents wholesale transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transactions environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized as revenue quarterly as auctions are completed and approved 
for most other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
channel partner commissions we pay commissions to our channel partners at contractual rates based on monthly energy transactions between energy suppliers and energy consumers 
the commission is accrued monthly and charged to sales and marketing expense as revenue is recognized 
we pay commissions to our salespeople at contractual commission rates based upon cash collections from our customers 
revenue estimation our estimates in relation to revenue recognition affect revenue and sales and marketing expense as reflected on our statements of operations  and trade accounts receivable and accrued commission accounts as reflected on our balance sheets 
for any quarterly reporting period  we may not have actual usage data for certain energy suppliers and will need to estimate revenue 
we initially record revenue based on the energy consumers historical usage profile 
at the end of each reporting period  we adjust this historical profile to reflect actual usage for the period and estimate usage where actual usage is not available 
for the year ended december   we estimated usage for approximately of our revenue resulting in a negative  or approximately  adjustment to decrease revenue 
this decrease in revenue resulted in an approximate  decrease in sales and marketing expense related to third party commission expense associated with those revenues 
corresponding adjustments were made to trade accounts receivable and accrued commissions  respectively 
a difference between this estimate and actual usage would have an approximate  effect on our revenue for the year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts on a specifically identified basis  as well as through historical experience applied to an aging of accounts  if necessary 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
to date write offs have not been material 
capitalized software certain acquired software and significant enhancements to our software are capitalized in accordance with guidance from the financial accounting standards board fasb 
no internally developed software costs were capitalized in and costs of approximately  and  related to implementation  coding and configuration were capitalized in and  respectively 
we amortize internally developed and purchased software over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years 
during  and  approximately   and  were amortized to cost of revenues  respectively 
accumulated amortization was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
our estimates for capitalization of software development costs affect cost of revenue and capitalized software as reflected on our consolidated statements of operations and on our consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   amortization expense was approximately of cost of revenue 
to the extent the carrying amount of the capitalized software costs may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate  we may need to record an impairment non cash charge and write off a portion or all of the capitalized software balance on the balance sheet 

table of contents goodwill we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value and fair value of our goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
we account for goodwill that results from acquired businesses in accordance with guidance with the fasb  under which goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
we perform an annual impairment review during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  or earlier  if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit whereby the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment analysis in december and determined that no impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets existed 
intangible assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our intangible assets 
the criteria used for these assumptions include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization expense are based on an estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends and significant changes in our strategic business objectives 
intangible assets consist of customer relationships and contracts  purchased technology and other intangibles  and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with guidance from the fasb  we periodically review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount 
no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded as no change in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable during income taxes in accordance with guidance from the fasb  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at the end of each period based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss carryforwards  as well as differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred income tax expense or credits are based on changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider past performance  expected future taxable income  and qualitative factors which we consider to be appropriate in estimating future taxable income 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is for future periods that can be reasonably estimated 
results that differ materially from current expectations may cause us to change our judgment on future taxable income and adjust our existing tax valuation allowance 
our estimates in relation to income taxes affect income tax benefit and deferred tax assets as reflected on our statements of operations and balance sheets  respectively 
the deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized in the near term 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a full valuation allowance has been established 
to the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover all of our deferred tax assets  it could result in an approximate million non cash tax benefit 
share based compensation in accordance with guidance from the fasb  we recognize the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for the year ended december   share based awards consisted of stock options and stock warrants  and for the years ended december  and  share based awards consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options 
the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over the vesting period 
the vesting period of share based awards is determined by the board of directors  and is generally four years for employees

seasonality our revenue is subject to seasonality and fluctuations during the year primarily as a result of weather conditions and its impact on the demand for energy 
the majority of our revenue is generated from the commissions we receive under any given energy contract  which is tied to the energy consumer s consumption of energy 
therefore  revenue from natural gas consumption tends to be strongest during the winter months due to the increase in heating usage  and revenue from electricity consumption tends to be strongest during the summer months due to the increase in air conditioning usage 
our revenue is also subject to fluctuations within any given season  depending on the severity of weather conditions during a particularly cold winter or an unseasonably warm summer  energy consumption will rise 
in addition  transaction revenue in the natural gas and wholesale markets for which we invoice upon completion of the respective transaction tends to be higher in the first and fourth quarters when utilities and natural gas customers make their annual natural gas buys 
cyclicality we believe that our business will continue to be cyclical in nature and is tied  in part  to market energy prices which impact transaction volume 
when energy prices increase in competitive markets above the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are less likely to lock in to higher fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and so they are less likely to use our auction platform 
conversely  when energy prices decrease in competitive markets below the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are more likely to lock in to lower fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and they are more likely to use our auction platform 
although our short term revenue is impacted by usage trends  these cyclical effects will also have longer term implications on our business because we derive future revenue from current auctions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
we provide our service at the inception of the service contract between the energy supplier and energy consumer 
our fee is set as a fixed dollar amount per unit of measure and fluctuates with changes in energy demand over the contract period 
foreign currency fluctuation our commission revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on energy consumers access to us dollars and on pricing competition 
we have entered into non us dollar contracts but they have not had a material impact on our operations 
we do not believe that foreign exchange fluctuations will materially affect our results of operations
