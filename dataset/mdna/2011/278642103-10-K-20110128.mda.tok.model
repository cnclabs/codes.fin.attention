technology our marketplaces and payments platforms utilize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others 
we have developed intuitive user interfaces  customer tools and transaction processing  database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites 
our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data  eases the deployment and operation of large scale global products and services and automates much of the administration of large scale clusters of computers 
our infrastructure has been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences 
we strive to continually improve our technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency  scalability and security 
for information regarding technology related risks  see the information in item a risk factors under the captions our failure to cost effectively manage certain aspects of our business could harm us  and system failures could harm our business 
intellectual property we regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights in the us and internationally  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  domain name  trade dress  and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location 
we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks or domain names  we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we currently are involved in several such legal proceedings 
please see the information in item legal proceedings and in item a risk factors under the captions we are subject to patent litigation and we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately

item a risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may decline 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include the following general economic conditions  including the possibility of a prolonged period of limited economic growth in the us and europe  disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the us and worldwide  adverse effects of the ongoing financial crisis in europe  contractions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit  and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the internet  ecommerce and payments industries  our ability to retain an active user base  attract new users  and encourage existing users to list items for sale  purchase items through our websites  or use our payment services  especially when consumer spending is weak  the primary and secondary effects of previously announced and possible future changes to our pricing  products and policies  including  among other changes  restrictions or holds on payments made to sellers or in connection with certain categories of higher risk transactions  changes to performance standards and or rewards for sellers  including taking into account cases filed through the ebay and paypal buyer protection programs in evaluating individual seller performance ratings  changes to the dispute resolution process  including directing ebay buyers to resolve disputes with sellers through ebay instead of through paypal  the adoption of a single fixed price format  which includes making listings previously available under our store inventory format accessible through our search algorithms  upgrades to ebay checkout services and  effective july  the discontinuation of support for third party checkout services  consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions using our websites or technology and the effect of any changes in our practices and policies designed to foster improved confidence  our ability to manage the costs of and effectively implement our user protection programs  the volume  velocity  size  timing

to certain cosmetic and perfume brands see item legal proceedings below  our ability to improve the quality of the user experience on our websites including our customer support in the event of a problem in light of the improved quality generally of the user experience offered by competitive internet merchants  our ability to reduce the loss of active buyers and sellers and increase activity of the users of our marketplaces business  especially with respect to our top buyers and sellers  changes to our use of advertising on our sites  including changes in ad placement  the impact on paypal or bill me later of regulations enacted pursuant to new laws regulating financial institutions  including the dodd frank act in the us  other new laws or regulations  or interpretations of existing laws or regulations  that impose liability on us for actions of our users or otherwise harm our business models or restrict the internet  ecommerce  online payments or online advertising  our ability to meet existing and new regulatory requirements as we expand the range and geographical scope of our services  especially for our payments business  the actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new sites  services  products and functionality  the costs and results of litigation that involves us  our ability to develop product enhancements  programs  and features on different platforms eg  mobile at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems  infrastructure  and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining operations  technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to us or our users by third parties  our ability to manage the transaction loss rate on ebay and in our payments business  our ability to manage funding costs and losses associated with our bill me later business  our ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we acquire  including new needs to manage credit risks and bad debts following our acquisition of bill me later in november and to manage competing marketplaces in korea following our acquisition of gmarket in june  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses  operations  and infrastructure  our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations  such as credit card networks and banks  the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising  and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner and to retain key employees  the continued healthy operation of our technology suppliers and other parties with which we have commercial relations  continued consumer acceptance of the internet as a medium for ecommerce and payments in the face of increasing publicity about fraud  spoofing  phishing  viruses  spyware  malware and other dangers of the internet  and macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce generally 
it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we invest heavily in technology  marketing and promotion  customer support  protection programs and further development of the operating infrastructure for our core and non core operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
growth rates of our marketplaces businesses in some of our most established markets have been slower than that for ecommerce generally and have declined in certain periods 
despite our efforts to stem this loss of market share in these and other markets  we may not be successful 
as our growth rates in established markets slow  we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing users  especially our top buyers and sellers  active and increasing their activity level on our websites in order to continue to grow our business 
in addition  our marketplaces business is facing increased competitive pressure 
in particular  the competitive norm for  and the expected level of service from  internet ecommerce websites has significantly increased  due to  for example  improved user experience  greater ease of buying goods  lower or no shipping costs  faster shipping times and more favorable return policies 
if we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace  particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed price items and higher service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms  our business will suffer 
we have announced changes to our marketplaces business intended to drive more sales and improve seller efficiency 
for example  in the us and the us  we have begun testing the efficacy of improving new seller performance and increasing buyer satisfaction by requesting that paypal hold new seller funds in certain instances  and we may expand the scope of such programs in the future 
some of the changes that we have announced to date have been controversial with  and led to dissatisfaction among  our sellers  and additional changes that we announce in the future may also be negatively received by some of our sellers 
this may not only impact the supply of items listed on our websites  but because many sellers also buy from our sites  it may adversely impact demand as well 
given the number of recent changes that we have made to our policies and pricing  it may take our sellers some time to fully assess and adjust to these changes  and sellers may elect to reduce volume while making such assessments and adjustments or in response to these changes 
if any of these changes cause sellers to move their business in whole or in part away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings  our operating results and profitability will be harmed 
we believe that the mix of sales under our traditional auction style listing format and fixed price listing format will continue to shift towards our fixed price format 
accordingly  we have eliminated some of the features related to our traditional auction style format and expect others will become less meaningful to  and used less frequently by  our sellers  which would result in a corresponding decrease in revenues from such features 
in addition  we expect that the costs associated with our seller discount programs will increase as more sellers will become eligible for such discounts 
in addition  because a large percentage of paypal transactions originate on the ebay platform  declines in growth rates in major marketplaces markets also adversely affect paypal growth 
the expected future growth of our paypal  stubhub  and other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross margins than our marketplaces platforms 
the economic downturn could harm our business 
our marketplaces and payments businesses are dependent on consumer purchases 
the economic downturn has resulted in reduced buyer demand and reduced selling prices and may reduce the volume of purchases on our marketplaces platforms and the volume of transactions paid for using our payment services  all of which would adversely affect our business 
in addition  the economic downturn has adversely affected our advertising revenues and may require us to increase our reserves for bad debt and transaction and loan losses 
continuing poor economic conditions will likely continue or exacerbate these trends 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use such as airline  cruise or concert tickets  paypal could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through its buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment through paypal 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
because we conduct the majority of our business outside the united states but report our financial results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or if exposure reports are delayed 
paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in non us currencies  and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  our translation of foreign currency denominated transactions will result in lower net revenues  operating expenses and net income if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  as happened in the first half of net revenues in the fiscal year ended december  were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
as exchange rates vary  net revenues and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  british pound  korean won  australian dollar or canadian dollar  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
in addition  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar or other currencies  cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods by non us purchasers will likely decrease  and that decrease will likely not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies  adversely affecting our business 
in addition  we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  relatively low interest rates have continued to limit our investment income  including income we earn on paypal customer balances  which in turn has materially lowered our net interest income 
bill me later operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender 
we acquired bill me later  a company that facilitates credit services by lending banks  in november bill me later is neither a chartered financial institution nor is it licensed to make loans in any state 
accordingly  bill me later must rely on a bank or licensed lender to issue the bill me later credit products and extend credit to customers in order to offer the bill me later service 
currently  when a consumer makes a purchase using a bill me later credit product issued by a chartered financial institution  the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer  funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant 
we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the extensions of credit made by the chartered financial institution and  as a result of the purchase  bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults 
although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account  we own the related receivable  and bill me later is responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 
in september  webbank became the issuer of the bill me later credit products 
any termination or interruption of webbank ability to lend could result in our being unable to originate any new transactions for the bill me later service 
under those circumstances  we would be required to either reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or to obtain our own bank charter  which would be a time consuming and costly process and would subject us to a number of additional laws and regulations 
a lawsuit has been filed against bill me later  paypal and ebay and is pending in the us district court for the central district of california  alleging that in its relationship with the chartered financial institution  bill me later is acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various california laws  including the state usury law 
the court dismissed the usury claims in december  but breach of contract and other claims remain 
we believe that these allegations are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  this area of law is uncertain and if the lawsuit is successful  bill me later may be required to change its methods of operations  pay substantial damages and reduce some of its charges and fees  which would likely adversely affect our business 
if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfers  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
while paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from markets  paypal only allows customers in of those markets including the us to receive payments  in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds 
these limitations may affect paypal ability to grow in these markets 
of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service  countries plus four french overseas departments are members of the european union  or eu 
since  paypal has provided localized versions of its service to customers in the eu through paypal europe sarl et cie  sca  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg 
accordingly  paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management  corporate governance or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks 
paypal has limited experience in operating as a bank  and any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the luxembourg regulator could adversely affect paypal business 
paypal europe implements its localized services in eu countries through a passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives  and has completed the passport notice process in all eu member countries 
the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business  in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law  and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office 
these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of  or delay  paypal plans for expanding its business in eu countries 
in addition  the eu payments service directive  which established a new regulatory regime for payment services providers  formally took effect in november the interpretation of regulations implementing the eu payments service directive remains uncertain 
in australia  paypal serves its customers through paypal australia pty 
ltd  which is licensed by the australian prudential regulatory authority as a purchased payment facility provider  which is a type of authorized depository institution 
accordingly  paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions 
in china  paypal is affiliated with shanghai wangfuyi information technology ltd  which is licensed as an internet content provider and operates a payments service only for chinese customers and only for transactions denominated in chinese currency 
the people bank of china pboc has recently enacted regulations to establish a new type of license  called a payment settlement organization pso license  which will be required for non bank payment services 
the pboc regulations leave unclear whether a foreign owned company such as paypal can control or invest in a payment settlement organization  and whether wangfuyi would be eligible to obtain a pso license 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in us states and territories and interpretations in seven states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes 
the remaining us state and territories do not currently regulate money transmitters 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  bonding requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
if paypal were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations  paypal could be subject to liability  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  forced to change its business practices  or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal 
any change to paypal business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
in markets other than the us  the eu  australia and the china domestic business  paypal serves its customers through paypal private ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is based in singapore 
in many of these markets  it is not clear whether paypal singapore based service is subject only to singaporean law or  if it were subject to local laws  whether such local law would require a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
in such markets  the business may rely on partnerships with local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency 
local regulators who do not have direct jurisdiction over singapore based paypal private ltd 
may use their local regulatory power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local banking partner 
such regulatory actions impacting local banking partner arrangements could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of paypal services in that market 
the reserve bank of india has asserted that paypal offering of payment services to customers outside of india to send personal  non commercial payments to recipients in india requires a license from the reserve bank 
for a period of time in  the reserve bank directed the indian affiliate of paypal processing bank to suspend withdrawals to the indian bank accounts of paypal customers for both personal and business customers 
paypal has suspended personal non commercial payments to and from indian accounts  and has also stopped offering certain commercial payments between indian buyers and indian sellers 
in november  the reserve bank of india issued guidelines to indian banks on the requirements for processing export related transactions for online payment gateway service providers such as paypal 
the reserve bank may again impose a suspension if it is not satisfied with paypal and its partner bank actions to comply with these guidelines 
in the event of any non compliance  paypal could be subject to fines from the reserve bank  and paypal prospects for future business in india  both cross border and domestic  could be materially and adversely affected 
even if paypal is not currently required to be licensed in some jurisdictions  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal service in those countries  or expansion of the financial products offered by paypal in new jurisdictions either alone  through a commercial alliance or through an acquisition  could subject paypal to additional licensure requirements  laws and regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny  any of which may harm paypal business 
these factors could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its products 
delay or failure to receive such a license or regulatory approval could require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal international expansion plans  and could require paypal to suspend providing products and services to customers in one or more countries 
paypal is also subject to various anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
although paypal has implemented a program to comply with these laws and regulations  any errors or failure to comply with federal  state or foreign money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties  and forfeiture of significant assets 
in the united states  paypal is subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more  and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
the interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain 
pending regulations may require paypal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international transactions more closely 
several countries in which paypal is regulated  including australia  luxembourg and singapore  have implemented new anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations  and paypal has had to make changes to its procedures in response 
in november  the australian anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing regulator austrac accepted an enforceable undertaking from paypal australia pursuant to which paypal australia agreed  among other things  to appoint an independent auditor to assess paypal australia anti money laundering compliance policies and procedures and issue a report identifying any unremediated deficiencies accompanied by a plan by paypal to remedy any such deficiencies 
in the enforceable undertaking  austrac expressed concern that paypal australia did not have systems and controls in place to manage adequately its money laundering and terrorist financing risk 
in september  the independent auditor completed its review and issued its report  and paypal australia submitted a remediation plan 
paypal australia is in the process of investing in improvements to its anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing systems  policies and operations as part of its remediation plan 
in addition  paypal australia will be required to obtain additional information from customers  verify that information  and monitor its customers activities more closely 
as paypal continues to localize its services in additional jurisdictions  it could be required to meet standards similar to those in australia 
these requirements could impose significant costs on paypal  cause delay to other planned product improvements  make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of its products 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has taken actions as though its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the us federal reserve board 
under such regulations  among other things  paypal is required to provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer 
paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants  but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account 
additionally  even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to  for each non compliant transaction or up to  per violation in any class action  and we could also be liable for plaintiffs attorneys fees 
in the second quarter of  two putative class action lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v 
ebay inc and paypal  inc  and moises zepeda v 
paypal  inc were filed in the us district court in the northern district of california 
these lawsuits contain allegations related to violations of aspects of the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e and violations of a previous settlement agreement related to regulation e  and or allege that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited user accounts 
these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypal practices among other remedies 
a determination that there have been violations of the electronic fund transfer act  regulation e or violations of other laws relating to paypal practices could expose paypal to significant liability 
changes to paypal practices that may result from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend product resources  which could cause delay to other planned product improvements  which would further harm our business 
our bill me later service is similarly subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
although we do not originate loans under the bill me later service  we do purchase receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the bank which originates them  and one or more jurisdictions may conclude that the ebay company which purchases those receivables is a lender or money transmitter or loan broker  which could subject us to liability or regulation in one or more jurisdictions 
as described under the caption bill me later operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above  a lawsuit has been filed against bill me later in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging that in its relationship with the former issuer of the bill me later credit products  bill me later was acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various california laws  including the state usury law 
additionally  federal regulators could mandate changes to the relationship between us and the issuing bank of the bill me later credit products 
any termination or interruption of the issuing bank lending services to consumers could result in an interruption of bill me later services  as described under the caption bill me later operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above 
also  effective in three stages in february  july and august  certain provisions of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of  or the card act  and certain changes to regulation z of the us federal reserve board require the issuing bank and us to make fundamental changes to many of the practices currently used with respect to bill me later consumer accounts  including marketing  pricing including finance charges  promotional programs and late fees assessed on receivables purchased by us from the bank and billing  which could in turn adversely affect this business 
the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and trade names  or other intellectual property rights 
see item legal proceedings below 
although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites  some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in asserting their purported rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us from time to time by rights owners  including litigation brought by luxury brand owners such as tiffany co 
in the us  rolex us and coty prestige lancaster group gmbh in germany  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france and l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie and laboratoire garnier cie in several european countries 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold ebay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties  for tester and other consumer products labeled in a manner to prevent resale and for unboxed and other allegedly nonconforming products listed on our sites by third parties  for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in listings or otherwise on our sites  or in connection with paid search advertisements  or for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws or parallel import laws for listings of authentic items  or for alleged non compliance with consumer protection laws 
such plaintiffs seek  among other things  injunctive relief and damages 
in the aggregate  these suits could result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could adversely affect our business 
these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs or make our websites less convenient to our customers 
any such results could materially harm our business 
in addition  rights owners have aggressively sought to reduce the applicability of limitations to intellectual property rights such as copyright exhaustion and the first sales doctrine in cases such as vernor v 
autodesk inc ninth circuit court of appeals and costco wholesale corp 
vs 
omega sa to the extent such doctrine are limited  the supply of goods available for resale on ebay may be adversely affected 
in addition to litigation from rights owners  we may be subject to regulatory  civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided in the sale of counterfeit goods 
while we have had some early success in defending against such litigation  more recent cases have been based  at least in part  on different legal theories than those of earlier cases  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation 
plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the digital millennium copyright act in the us or as a hosting provider in the european union under the electronic commerce directive because of the alleged active nature of our involvement with our sellers  and that  whether or not such safe harbors are available  we should be found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed listings that are counterfeit or are authentic but allegedly violate trademark or copyright law or effectively suspended users who have created such listings 
we are continuously seek to improve and modify our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items 
these improvements are in response to ongoing business initiatives designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer satisfaction as well as in response to new patterns we are seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our users 
notwithstanding these efforts  we believe that the legal climate  especially in europe  is becoming more adverse to our positions  which may require us to take actions which could lower our revenues  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers  which may materially harm our business 
in addition  a public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our sites  even if factually incorrect  could damage our reputation and our business 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items  such as payment companies 
to the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against paypal based upon the use of paypal payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items  including on our websites  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to patent litigation 
we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents 
some of these ongoing suits are described under the heading item legal proceedings below 
we are a defendant in other patent suits and we have been notified of several other potential patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces and payments segments as our services expand in scope and complexity 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  or could require us to cease conducting certain operations 
use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services  or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
in december  an executive of baazee 
com  our indian subsidiary  was arrested in connection with a user listing of a pornographic video clip on that website 
we continue to contest the charges related to this arrest 
similarly  one of our korean subsidiaries iac and one of its employees were found criminally liable for listings which occurred prior to our acquisition of iac on iac website 
the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent prohibited dvds from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty 
in a number of circumstances  third parties  including government regulators and law enforcement officials  have alleged that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws  including antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets  laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items  the fencing of stolen goods  selective distribution channel laws  distance selling laws and the sale of items outside of the us that are regulated by us export controls 
although we have prohibited the listing of illegal and stolen goods and certain high risk items and implemented other protective measures  we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings  any of which could harm our business 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
certain manufacturers and large retailers have sought new us federal and state legislation regarding stolen goods that could limit our ability to allow sellers to use our sites without confirming the source of  and their legal rights to sell  the underlying goods 
in addition  from time to time we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal goods and stolen goods using our services 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation  diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our services 
paypal payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software and other copyrighted or trademarked goods  money laundering  terrorist financing  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  online securities fraud and encouraging  promoting  facilitating or instructing others to engage in illegal activities 
there has been an increased focus by rights owners and us government officials on the role payments systems play in the sale of  and payment for  pirated digital goods on the internet 
recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities  and additional payments related proposals are under active consideration by government policymakers 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  illegal activities could still be funded using paypal 
any resulting claims or liabilities could harm our business 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
as discussed above with respect to certain specific issues  the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories have been brought against us  as well as other online service companies 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for not removing content posted in the feedback forum 
furthermore  several court decisions arguably have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to internet service providers like us under the communications decency act 
for example  the ninth circuit has held that certain immunity provisions under the communications decency act might not apply to the extent that a website owner materially contributes to the development of unlawful content on its website 
as our websites evolve  challenges to the applicability of these immunities can be expected to continue 
in addition  the paris court of appeal has ruled in the louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture cases that applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts from liability are inapplicable to ebay given that ebay actively promotes bidding on its sellers listings and receives a commission on successful transactions  and is therefore a broker 
this trend  if continued  may increase our potential liability to third parties for the user provided content on our sites  particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites on a daily basis 
government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about both ebay and paypal  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  from time to time we have been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
paypal has received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  increase educational messaging to users about funding choices  and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
we currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken that are designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites and we may face similar inquires from other government regulators in the future 
for example  both the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia recently reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods 
other regulators have requested information concerning paypal limitations of customer accounts 
similarly  bill me later has from time to time received customer complaints that could result in investigations into bill me later business practices by state or federal regulators 
as a result of the recent credit crisis  new laws have been passed  and we expect additional new laws and regulations to be adopted that impose  among other requirements  additional obligations and restrictions on the provision of credit 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  including under existing or new credit laws or regulations  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures  operating procedures and disclosures 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to enforcement actions  fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded and our company has grown larger 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
we are also subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws of general applicability  including laws regulating working conditions eg  the fair labor standards act 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  damage awards  injunctive relief  or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources  or otherwise harm our business 
changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate 
in april  we announced plans to change the dispute resolution process which we refer to as resolutions for transactions on ebay 
com and ebay 
co 
uk in which a buyer claims the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing 
we implemented these plans beginning in the fourth quarter of previously  buyers with an issue on our ebay 
com and ebay 
co 
uk platform were generally required to contact the seller directly and  if they were unable to resolve the issue  to start the resolutions process online via paypal resolution center 
we have transitioned to a new  on ebay resolutions process provided by ebay customer support  which now serves as the primary entry point for buyers on ebay 
com and ebay 
co 
uk who are unable to resolve their disputes with ebay sellers 
among other things  the new resolutions process provides that ebay will generally reimburse the buyer for the full amount of an item purchase price including original shipping costs  in cases where the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing  and the seller does not provide adequate resolution to the buyer 
ebay then attempts to recoup amounts paid to the buyer from the seller paypal accounts or other payment methods 
our costs associated with resolutions have increased as a result of these changes to our resolutions policies and process 
these changes  together with any further changes that we may make to our resolutions process in the future  may be negatively received by  and lead to dissatisfaction on the part of  some of our sellers 
these changes may also result in an increase in buyer fraud and associated transaction losses 
in addition  ebay does not have the same level of rights of recoupment against sellers as paypal  which may result in higher costs to operate the program 
failure to deal effectively with bad transactions and customer disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our business 
over the last several years  we have enhanced the buyer and seller protections offered by paypal in certain ebay marketplaces  and in certain countries for transactions outside of ebay marketplaces 
these changes to paypal buyer and seller protection program could result in future increases and fluctuations in our payments transaction loss rate 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  our payments transaction losses including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled million  million and million  representing  and of our net total payment volume in the respective periods 
we have also recently changed the dispute resolution process for transactions on ebay 
com and ebay 
co 
uk  as described in greater detail above under the caption changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate  which could result in an increase in our combined ebay and paypal transaction losses 
paypal highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal 
we believe that several of paypal current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
while paypal uses advanced anti fraud technologies  we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal anti fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods 
in addition  paypal service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
merchants could also request reimbursement  or stop using paypal  if they are affected by buyer fraud or other types of fraud 
paypal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud  including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant description 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from buyer fraud  from erroneous transmissions  and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition to the direct costs of such losses  if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive  they could potentially result in paypal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and result in corresponding decreases in our net total payment volume  in which case our business would further suffer 
the bill me later service is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants  users of the bill me later service and third parties handling its user information  which could increase our exposure to transaction losses and adversely affect this business 
our payments business has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
ebay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase 
non payment may occur because of miscommunication  because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item  or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or ebay 
in some european and asian jurisdictions  buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period 
while ebay can  in some cases  suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs 
the impact of changes to our dispute resolutions program implemented beginning in is discussed in more detail above under the caption changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate 
our limited ebay and paypal buyer protection programs represent the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded  have not received the item that they purchased  or have received an item different than what was described 
however  users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card company or bank  which in turn will seek reimbursement from paypal 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly and time consuming for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our marketplaces and payments services could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users  and diminish the value of our brand names 
we believe that negative user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our services 
governmental regulators worldwide are also looking at approaches intended to reduce online fraud 
some of the current proposals eg  two factor authentication in france to verify a user identity could increase our costs and require us to change our business practices in ways that would harm our business 
from time to time  we have considered more active mechanisms designed to combat bad transactions and increase buyer satisfaction  including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity as a result 
our increased usage of these or other mechanisms to attempt to improve buyer satisfaction could result in dissatisfaction on the part of sellers  loss of share to competing marketplaces  reduced selection of inventory on our sites and other adverse effects 
any factors that reduce cross border trade could harm our business 
cross border trade has become an increasingly important source of both revenue and profits for us 
cross border transactions using our websites generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market 
we generally earn higher transaction fees for cross border transactions involving paypal  and our marketplaces business continues to represent a relatively easy way for buyers and sellers to engage in cross border trade compared with other alternatives 
any factors that result in a net reduction in cross border trade  including  among other factors  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws  such as selective distribution channel laws and parallel import laws  to users in other countries eg  the interpretation and application of such laws to the sale of gray market goods  the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg  the jurisdiction of the buyer  the seller  and or the location of the item being sold  or any other factors that impose restrictions on  or increase the costs of  purchasing  selling or shipping goods across national borders including customs enforcement and tariffs would harm our business 
our business is subject to online security risks  including security breaches 
our businesses involve the storage and transmission of users proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  litigation  and potential liability 
an increasing number of websites  including several other large internet companies  have recently disclosed breaches of their security  some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems  change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users 
a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users proprietary information  cause interruption in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws  significant legal and financial exposure  damage to our reputation  and a loss of confidence in our security measures  which could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
paypal users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised 
non technical means  for example  actions by a suborned employee  can also result in a data breach 
under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors  if there is a breach of payment card information that we store  or that is stored by paypal direct payment card processing customers  we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses 
in addition  if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards  even if there is no compromise of customer information  we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees 
if we were unable to accept payment cards  our business would be seriously damaged 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have  in certain instances  made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
in december  paypal was subject to a series of distributed denial of service attacks following paypal decision to permanently restrict the account used by wikileaks due to a violation of paypal acceptable use policy 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches  including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users personal information  could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our users computers 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay  paypal  or a user of one of those businesses  but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program 
despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through product improvements and user education  spoof and phishing remain a serious problem that may damage our brands  discourage use of our websites  and increase our costs 
changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially for financial information and for users located outside of the us in addition  as an entity licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg  paypal europe sarl et cie  sca is subject to banking secrecy laws 
in many cases  these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations 
new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux 
these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications 
complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
in addition  we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal  state or international privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others  subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us 
in addition  as noted above  we are subject to the possibility of security breaches  which themselves may result in a violation of these laws 
our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control 
we derive significant revenue from advertising on our websites 
revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures  such as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer spending  as well as the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative to other websites 
recent economic conditions have adversely impacted our advertising revenue 
in addition  major search engine operators have the ability to change from time to time  at their sole discretion  the rules and search algorithms governing the pricing  availability  and placement of online advertising 
any changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our websites  either directly or indirectly 
for example  retailers pay a fee to shopping 
com for online shoppers directed to their websites by shopping 
com 
rule changes made by search engines in disrupted traffic to our shopping 
com website  which in turn adversely affected click through traffic to retailers from our shopping 
com website and associated fee revenue 
furthermore  we have recently changed the placement of ads on our sites  which may reduce the amount we are paid 
finally  legislators and regulators in various jurisdictions  including the us and the european union  are reviewing internet advertising models and the use of user related data  and are considering proposals that could restrict or otherwise impact this business model 
if we experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to economic  competitive  regulatory  technological or other factors  including the worldwide economic slowdown  or due to the renegotiation of the terms of our contracts with major advertising companies or due to a reduction in our ability to effectively place advertisements on our sites or otherwise provide value to our advertisers  our business and financial results would suffer 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands  and these efforts may be costly 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services  and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts across all of our brands 
we will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on  and devote substantial resources to  advertising  marketing  and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users 
since  we have significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting  adding shopping 
com  our classified websites eg  ebay classifieds  kijiji  marktplaats and den bl avis  stubhub  bill me later and gmarket  among others 
each of these brands requires its own resources  increasing the costs of our branding efforts 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands 
also  major search engine operators that we use to advertise our brands have frequently changing rules that govern their pricing  availability and placement of online advertisement eg  paid search  keywords  and changes to these rules could negatively affect our use of online advertising to promote our brands 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  our business would be harmed 
new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
it is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property issues  parallel imports and distribution controls  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act and the european union directives on distance selling and electronic commerce  are being interpreted by the courts  but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 
furthermore  as our activities and the types of goods and services listed on our websites expand  including through acquisitions such as bill me later and stubhub  regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction  either generally or with respect to certain actions eg  the sale of real estate  event tickets  cultural goods  boats and automobiles 
recent financial and political events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies in general and financial services companies in particular 
our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to their business to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators 
these established businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations 
they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services 
in particular  these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing  parallel imports  professional seller obligations  selective distribution networks  stolen goods  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights  and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues 
in addition  regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past 
changing the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third party listings could negatively impact our business 
over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in a number of states and the us congress that would make ebay liable for the sale of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform  including gift cards and health and beauty products 
no such legislation has passed 
nonetheless  the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation  and if any of these laws are adopted they could harm our business 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions  including france  have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users 
attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could harm our business 
in france  we have been sued by conseil des ventes  the french auction regulatory authority 
the authority alleges that sales on our french website constitute illegal auctions that cannot be performed without its consent 
although we have won this lawsuit in the lower court  this decision is being appealed 
a lawsuit alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two associations of french antique dealers 
we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 
however  these and other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation and  if successful  could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues for example  by forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes could harm our business 
a number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws 
for example  trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder consent 
the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet  and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations  our business could be harmed 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users  or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction 
for example  we were found liable in france  under french law in the louis vuitton malletier litigation for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers or sellers see item legal proceedings below 
laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  competitors  users and other third parties 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings  and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business 
in addition  we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us 
our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services  in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions 
in light of the global financial crisis  us federal lawmakers enacted legislation in overhauling the federal government oversight of consumer financial products and systemic risk in the us financial system 
although the full effect of the new legislation will be dependent on regulations to be adopted by a number of different agencies  we expect the general effect of the new law will be to require paypal and bill me later to make additional disclosures to their users and to impose new restrictions on certain of their activities 
these new obligations will increase our costs and may result in increased litigation  the need to make expensive product changes and other adverse impacts on our business 
in addition  we also expect that the continued implementation of the financial reform law enacted in will adversely impact some significant traditional revenue streams for banks  such as overdraft fees and debit card interchange fees 
as a result  banks may need to revise their business models to remain profitable  which may lead them to charge more for services which were previously provided for free or at lower cost 
any resulting increases in service fees required for paypal to process transactions eg  service fees for automated clearing house transactions would increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
changes to payment card networks or bank fees  rules  or practices could harm paypal business 
paypal does not belong to or directly access payment card networks  such as visa and mastercard  which enable paypal acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions  and must pay fees for this service 
from time to time  payment card networks have increased  and may increase in the future  the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
paypal payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing 
changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase paypal operating costs and reduce its profit margins 
in addition  in some markets  governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees  or have opened investigations as to whether visa or mastercard interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law 
in the united states  the financial reform law enacted in authorizes the federal reserve board to regulate debit card interchange rates and debit card network exclusivity provisions  and the federal reserve board has proposed rules that include caps on debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard currently charge 
the federal reserve board proposal also requests comment on whether non traditional payment systems such as paypal should be treated as payment card networks subject to the new law on debit card interchange and exclusivity 
if paypal is treated as a payment card network for this purpose  paypal revenues could be reduced and its business could be adversely affected 
any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets could jeopardize paypal competitive position against traditional credit and debit card processors 
paypal is required by its processors to comply with payment card network operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypal customers 
the payment card networks set and interpret the card rules 
payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments  or could lose its ability to give customers the choice of currency in which they would like their card to be charged 
if paypal were unable to accept payment cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and our business would further suffer 
paypal is required to comply with payment card networks special operating rules for internet payment services 
paypal and its payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these rules  but any failure to comply could result in fines  the amount of which would be within the payment card networks discretion 
paypal also could be subject to fines from payment card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk  primarily the sale of certain types of digital content 
for high risk merchants  paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants 
paypal has incurred fines from its payment card processors relating to paypal failure to detect the use of its service by high risk merchants 
the amount of these fines has not been material  but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts  could become material  and could result in a termination of paypal ability to accept payment cards or changes in paypal process for registering new customers  which would seriously damage paypal business 
changes in paypal funding mix could adversely affect paypal results 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using credit cards  lower payments when customers fund payments with debit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or use buyer credit issued by ge money bank 
as of october  eligible us customers may also fund payment transactions through a loan originated by an unaffiliated lender as part of the bill me later service  and paypal will incur no fees for such transactions 
customers fund a significant portion of paypal payment volume using credit cards  and paypal financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards 
senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons  including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with their credit card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  the ability to earn frequent flier miles  cash rebates  or other incentives offered by credit card issuers  the ability to defer payment  or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal 
in addition  some of paypal offerings  including the ability for buyers to make a limited number of payments without opening an account  have a higher rate of credit card funding than paypal basic product offering 
paypal failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its business 
paypal ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers  paypal has a limited operating history and limited management experience in managing these internal controls 
as paypal business continues to grow  it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage customer funds accurately could severely diminish customer use of paypal products 
our decision to launch our paypal developer platform  which is open to third party developers  subjects us to new risks 
in  we launched the paypal developer platform to enable third party developers to access a wide variety of paypal product and programming code specifications and to connect to select paypal payment application programming interfaces apis 
we also began providing a software tool kit for building mobile payments applications 
in addition  we provide third party developers with access to certain apis with respect to our marketplaces platforms 
there is no assurance that third party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on paypal platforms on a timely basis or at all  and a number of factors could cause such third party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms 
in addition  our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions  which may be contravened by such third party applications 
if this were to occur  we would be liable for the regulatory failure and our business could be adversely affected 
system failures could harm our business 
we have experienced system failures from time to time  and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits  could harm our future revenues and profits  and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
our ebay 
com website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours 
in november  technical systems issues resulted in ebay 
com users being unable to search for listed items for a period of several hours 
our paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days  most recently for approximately two hours in october other of our websites eg  stubhub have experienced intermittent unavailability from time to time 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
reliability is particularly critical for paypal  especially as it seeks to expand its merchant services business 
because paypal is a regulated financial institution  frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to fines  penalties  or mandatory changes to paypal business practices  and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  cyber attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  human error  hardware or software defects or malfunctions  and similar events or disruptions 
some of our systems  including our shopping 
com website and the systems related to the bill me later business  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions  delays  and loss of critical data  and result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and our international business  especially in germany  korea and the uk  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
net revenues outside the us accounted for approximately of our net revenues in each of the fiscal years ended december   and expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local cultures  standards and policies 
the commercial  internet  and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our traditional marketplaces business model 
in many countries  we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do  and we may not benefit from first to market advantages 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew our ebay marketplace offering from the japanese market  and in we contributed our business in china to a joint venture with a local chinese company 
even if we are successful in developing new markets  we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues from those sites for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  including through the expansion of paypal  shopping 
com  and our classified businesses  we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following strong local competitors  regulatory requirements  including regulation of internet services  auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  privacy and data protection  banking  and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require product changes  require special licensure  subject us to various taxes  penalties or audits  or limit the transfer of information between us and our affiliates  greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less developed with respect to the internet  unique local laws  conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  online trading  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card networks  and electronic fund transfer systems  differing levels of retail distribution  shipping  and internet infrastructures  different employee employer relationships and labor laws  and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  challenges associated with joint venture relationships and minority investments  including dependence on our joint venture partners  difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher internet service provider costs  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  seasonal reductions in business activity  expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  restrictions on the repatriation of funds  foreign currency exchange restrictions  and exchange rate fluctuations  volatility in a specific country or region political  economic or military conditions eg  in south korea relating to its disputes with north korea  challenges associated with maintaining relationships with local law enforcement and related agencies  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and repatriating money without adverse tax consequences  and increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under the caption we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates above 
in addition  we conduct certain functions  including product development  customer support and other operations  in regions outside the us  particularly in india and china 
we are subject to both us and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities  and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits  including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements  associated with providing these functions outside of the us could adversely affect our business 
we maintain a portion of shopping 
com research and development facilities and personnel in israel  and in we acquired fraud sciences ltd  an israeli company 
political  economic and military conditions in israel affect those operations 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain 
increased hostilities or terrorism within israel or armed hostilities between israel and neighboring countries or other entities could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in israel  which could increase our costs 
in addition  many of our employees in israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances 
our israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military service  which could adversely affect our business 
acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties  dilution  and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  including  most recently  milo 
com in the united states and brandsfriends  an online shopping club in germany 
the acquisitions of milo 
com and brandsfriends expose us to new risks associated with these adjacent businesses  including risks related to merchants continuing their relationships with milo 
com or brandsfriends on acceptable terms  if at all  and risks related to the unavailability of safe harbor liability protection as a hosting provider under european union law for the brandsfriends business 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  as well as strategic investments and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions 
any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration  particularly given the number  size and varying scope of our recent acquisitions  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in  or acceleration of  compensation  or changes in management  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company accounting  management  information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  in the case of foreign acquisitions  the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic  currency  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries  in some cases  the need to transition operations  users  and customers onto our existing platforms  and liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including violations of laws  rules and regulations  commercial disputes  tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions  or may not realize them in the time frame expected 
future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write offs of goodwill  which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders 
in addition  we have made certain investments  including through joint ventures  in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control 
the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests  strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours  and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture 
bill me later operations expose us to additional risks 
risks associated with our reliance on an unaffiliated lender in providing the bill me later service are discussed in detail under the caption bill me later operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above 
the bill me later service relies on third party merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions 
for the fiscal year ended december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of all transaction volume by dollar amount through the bill me later service was settled through the facilities of a single vendor 
any disruption to these third party payment processing and gateway services would adversely affect the bill me later service 
the bill me later service is offered to a wide range of consumers  and the financial success of this business depends on the ability of the issuing bank of the bill me later credit products to manage credit risk related to those products 
the lender extends credit using bill me later proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific customers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores 
based on these performance criteria  the lender may extend or increase lines of credit to consumers at the point of sale 
these algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to  among other factors  inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment 
the accuracy of the predictions and the ability of the lender and us to manage credit risk related to the bill me later service may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations  competitors actions  changes in consumer behavior and other factors 
the lender may also incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies  which may impact the financial performance of the bill me later service 
in addition  economic and financial conditions in the us may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit  including the credit extended by the lender to consumers who use the bill me later service  which could impair the growth and profitability of this business 
we anticipate that the volume of credit extended by webbank the financial institution issuing the bill me later credit products will increase as we begin to enable qualified buyers with a paypal account to use bill me later as a payment funding option for transactions on ebay 
com and on certain merchant websites that accept paypal 
we purchase the receivables relating to these consumer loans extended by the issuing bank  and therefore bear the risk of loss 
like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit  the bill me later service faces the risk that certain account holders will default on their payment obligations  making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge offs 
the rate at which receivables were charged off as uncollectible  or the net charge off rate  was approximately and for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
the nonpayment rate among bill me later users may increase due to  among other things  worsening economic conditions  such as the current recession in the us  and higher unemployment rates 
consumers who miss payments on their obligations often fail to repay them  and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their credit 
the age and rate of growth of the receivables related to a consumer credit portfolio also affects the rate of missed payments and accounts charged off as uncollectible 
we currently fund the purchase of receivables related to bill me later accounts through the sale of commercial paper  our cash balances and free cash flow generated from our portfolio of businesses 
effective september   we fund receivables generated through new bill me later accounts using offshore cash from our luxembourg based bank 
a downgrade in our credit ratings  particularly our short term credit ratings  would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue or  in certain circumstances  could prevent us from making commercial paper borrowings  increase our commercial paper borrowing costs  or both 
if we are unable to fund our purchase of receivables related to the bill me later business adequately or in a cost effective manner  the growth and profitability of this business could be significantly and adversely affected 
additionally  in providing the bill me later service  we face other risks similar to those faced by paypal  including the risk of system failures  security breaches or other loss of customer data  fraud  intellectual property claims  compliance failures  and changes to regulations relating to credit offerings described in these risk factors  including under the captions government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties and if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfer  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax vat  goods and services tax  business tax  and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ebay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or ecommerce 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of ecommerce 
for example  the state of new york has passed legislation that requires any out of state seller of tangible personal property to collect and remit new york use tax if the seller engages affiliates above certain financial thresholds in new york to perform certain business promotion activities 
several ecommerce companies are challenging this new law 
north carolina and rhode island have also enacted similar laws related to affiliates  and a number of other states appear to be considering similar legislation 
the state of colorado recently enacted new legislation that takes a slightly different approach by imposing a set of use tax collection notice and reporting requirements but not the actual tax collection responsibility on certain retailers with no physical presence in colorado 
the law is designed to aid colorado in collecting use tax from colorado residents who purchase taxable items from out of state retailers 
a draft regulation promulgated by the colorado department of revenue would exclude from these reporting obligations businesses that sell  or less into the state in a calendar year  thus limiting the impact on our sellers 
oklahoma has enacted a similar law 
while the recent laws in new york  north carolina  rhode island  oklahoma and colorado do not specifically apply to our business  the proliferation of such state legislation  particularly as many states seek to expand revenues generated by broader taxes  could adversely affect some of our sellers at some point in the future and indirectly harm our business 
in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing  multi year effort by us state  and local governments to require collection and remittance of remote sales tax by out of state sellers hr  the main street fairness act  was most recently introduced in the th session of the us congress 
the act  which was not enacted prior to the adjournment of the congress  would allow states that meet certain simplification and other standards to require out of state sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
sellers meeting an as yet undefined small seller exception would be excluded from the requirements of the act 
this legislation  which may be reintroduced in the th congress as a way to enable states to increase sales tax revenues and help address significant state budgetary shortfalls caused by the economic downturn 
the adoption of this act or similar legislation that lacks a robust small business exemption would result in the imposition of sales taxes and additional costs associated with complex sales tax collection  remittance and audit compliance requirements on our sellers 
this would make selling on our websites less attractive for small retailers  and would harm our business 
from time to time  some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes 
in may  the city of chicago notified both ebay and stubhub that they are liable for a city amusement tax on tickets to events in chicago  irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller  and filed suit to enforce collection of taxes it claims are due 
in march  the court ruled that stubhub is not required to collect and remit the city amusement tax 
the city of chicago requested reconsideration of this ruling and stubhub sought clarification of the ruling relative to the remaining counts as well 
in august  the court entered a final order dismissing the case against stubhub 
in december  the court also dismissed the case against ebay 
the city of chicago appealed both matters to the seventh circuit court of appeals 
the seventh circuit recently issued an opinion in the stubhub matter rejecting the federal arguments advanced by stubhub and certifying the state law arguments to the illinois state supreme court 
the seventh circuit is holding its ruling on the ebay matter in abeyance pending a resolution of the stubhub proceedings 
the application of similar existing or future laws could adversely affect our business 
several proposals have been made at the us state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
the us federal government moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been extended through november this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and or one of its extensions 
similar issues exist outside of the us  where the application of vat or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers such as ebay is uncertain and evolving 
while we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due  certain of our subsidiaries have  from time to time  received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees 
should such taxes become applicable  our business could be harmed 
we collect and remit indirect taxes in certain jurisdictions 
however  tax authorities may raise questions about our obligation to collect and remit such taxes  as well as the proper calculation of such taxes 
for example  a korean tax authority is currently asserting that certain coupons and incentives available on our sites should not be deducted when computing taxes on our fees 
should any new taxes become applicable to our fees or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient  our business could be harmed 
we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services 
one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection  reporting or record keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce 
such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been discussed in the us congress  several states  and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if an ebay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates 
in july  the housing and economic recovery act of hr was signed into law 
this law contains provisions that require companies that provide payments over electronic means to users to report to the internal revenue service irs information on payments received by certain customers 
the legislation  effective for payments received after december   requires paypal and other electronic payments providers  as well as potentially stubhub and similar companies  to report to the irs on us based customers who receive more than  in payments and more than payments in a year  and to request tax id numbers from us users and track payments by tax id number 
the irs regulations may also require us to collect a certification of non us taxpayer status from international merchants 
these requirements may decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
one or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction  regardless of where the respective users are located 
imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business 
foreign authorities may also require ebay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers  including tax requirements 
in addition  we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites  and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data 
the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers  especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce  and any use of those records to investigate  collect taxes from  or prosecute sellers  could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate 
in most cases  we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries 
however  because of our unique business model  the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain 
a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our business 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebay obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations 
passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or tax related reporting requirements could harm our users and our business 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which ebay conducts or will conduct business 
our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet 
internet service providers may be able to block  degrade  or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings 
our customers rely on access to the internet to use our products and services 
in many cases that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings  including incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  mobile communications companies  and large internet service providers 
some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade  disrupt  or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings  or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings 
in addition  internet service providers could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings 
worldwide  a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions 
the united states federal communications commission enacted rules on december  preserving the open internet broadband industry practices 
fcc establishing baseline restrictions that would regulate the ability of internet access companies to interfere with internet traffic transported over wired and wireless networks 
these fcc rules are likely to be reviewed by the federal courts in pending greater regulatory and judicial clarity  interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings  whether paid by us or by our customers  could cause us to lose existing customers  impair our ability to attract new customers  and harm our revenue and growth 
our tickets business is subject to regulatory  competitive  and other risks that could harm this business 
our tickets business  which includes our stubhub business  is subject to numerous risks 
many jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets 
some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all  or highly regulate the resale of tickets  and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions may be adopted that could limit or inhibit our ability to operate  or our users ability to continue to use  our tickets business 
regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions 
some event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our sites 
suits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past  and may in the future  be filed against stubhub and ebay by venue owners  competitors  ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers 
such litigation could result in damage awards  could require us to change our business practices in ways that may be harmful to our business  or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business 
our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries 
the recent economic downturn has resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our sites and has negatively impacted revenue and profits 
in addition  a work stoppage  strike or lockout by a professional sports league for example  the national football league or the national basketball association could result in the cancellation of all or a portion of the games in a league season  which would harm our tickets business 
our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources  including ticketing service companies such as live nation entertainment formerly ticketmaster  aeg  comcast spectacor and tickets 
com  event organizers such as professional sports teams and leagues  ticket brokers  and other online and offline ticket resellers  such as ticketsnow which is owned by live nation entertainment and razorgator 
in addition  some ticketing service companies and event organizers have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designed to restrict or prohibit the transferability of such event tickets 
ticketing service companies have also begun to use market based pricing strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices that they historically have for premium tickets 
besides charging higher prices  these ticketing service companies have also imposed additional restrictions on transferability for these types of tickets  such as requiring customers to pick up these tickets at will call with the purchasing credit card 
to the extent that event tickets issued in this manner cannot be resold on our websites  or to the extent that we are otherwise unable to compete with these competitors  our tickets business would be harmed 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and some members of our senior management team have fully vested the vast majority of their in the money equity incentives 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we currently have a number of vacancies on our senior management team including president  ebay marketplaces that we are seeking to fill 
our businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
similarly  decreases in the number of unvested in the money stock options held by existing employees  whether because our stock price has declined  options have vested  or because the size of follow on option grants has declined  may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees 
problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business 
a number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  storefronts that help our users list items  caching services that make our sites load faster  and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform  among others 
in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
paypal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the payment card and bank clearing networks 
similarly  bill me later relies on an unaffiliated lender in providing the bill me later service and also relies heavily on third parties to operate its services  including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions 
financial or regulatory issues  labor issues eg  strikes or work stoppages or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on our websites more difficult  thereby harming our business 
in addition  price increases by companies that provide services to our users such as postal and delivery services could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our users to complete transactions  thereby harming our business 
any security breach at a company providing services to our users could also adversely affect our customers and harm our business 
in addition  we have outsourced certain functions to third party providers  including customer support and product development functions  which are critical to our operations 
if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily  our operations could be disrupted  which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business  reputation and operating results 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with  or if necessary replace  third parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
if any third parties were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms  including as a result of bankruptcy due to poor economic conditions  we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms  or at all 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or anti fraud measures could diminish use of our services 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
measures that we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users 
these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer support requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could significantly impact our profitability 
failure to manage or train our own or outsourced customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
if we do not handle customer complaints effectively  our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence 
because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal must provide telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
as part of paypal program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering  it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer account activity are identified by paypal risk models as suspicious 
paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions  and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve account restrictions promptly 
in the second quarter of  two putative class action lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v 
ebay inc and paypal  inc  and moises zepeda v 
paypal  inc 
were filed in the us district court in the northern district of california 
these lawsuits contain allegations that paypal improperly held user funds or otherwise improperly limited user accounts 
these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypal practices among other remedies 
a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to paypal practices can expose paypal to significant liability 
changes to paypal practices that may result from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend product resources  which could cause delay to other planned product improvements  which would further harm our business 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  paypal users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity  its ability to attract new customers may be damaged  and it could become subject to additional litigation 
as a result  current and future revenues could suffer  losses could be incurred  and its operating margins may decrease 
in addition  negative publicity about  or negative experiences with  customer support for any of our businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brands individually or as a whole 
our industries are intensely competitive 
marketplaces our marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a large number of companies providing particular categories of goods and or broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels can be relatively low and current offline and new competitors  including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores  can easily launch online sites at nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful ecommerce companies 
moreover  online and offline business increasingly are competing with each other 
consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through our marketplaces businesses have more and more alternatives 
our competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount  and general merchandise stores as well as the online operations of these traditional retailers  emerging online retailers  online classified services  and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
in the us  these include wal mart  target  sears  macy  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam club  amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc  and home shopping network  among others 
a number of companies offer a variety of services that provide channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes  including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake  google merchant center  oodle 
com and a number of international websites operated by schibsted asa 
in certain markets  our fixed price listing and traditional auction style listing formats are increasingly being challenged by other formats  such as classifieds 
our classifieds websites  including ebay classifieds  kijiji  marktplaats  mobile 
de  gumtree  den bl avis and bilbasen  offer classifieds listings in the us and a variety of local international markets 
in many markets in which they operate  including in the us  our classified platforms compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms 
our online shopping comparison site  shopping 
com  competes with sites such as buy 
com  google product search  nextag 
com  pricegrabber 
com  shopzilla  and yahoo product search  which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
recent legal developments may affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers limit variation in product pricing 
in addition  sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels  including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as google  bing and yahoo 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also compete with many local  regional  and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major categories of products offered on our site 
for example  category specific competitors to offerings in our clothing  shoes accessories category include  among others  ae 
com  amazon 
com  bluefly 
com  coldwater creek 
com  dillard  dsw  the gap  jc penney  kohl  land end  lane bryant  ll bean  macy  nike  nieman marcus  nordstrom  old navy  overstock 
com  payless  shoebuy  shoes 
com  target  victoria secret  wal mart and zappos 
com  as well as other online and offline retailers  stores and shopping networks 
our international marketplaces websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online ecommerce sites  such as quelle and otto in germany  leboncoin 
fr and priceminister in france  taobao in china  tradus owned by naspers in poland  yahoo kimo in taiwan  lotte  naver and th street in south korea  trading post  oztion and aussie bidder in australia  and amazon and play 
com in the united kingdom and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
as our businesses in less developed countries grow  we increasingly may compete with domestic competitors which have advantages we do not possess  such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities 
the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  trust in the seller and the transaction  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion  interaction and size  website ease of use and accessibility  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
other online ecommerce sites may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay sellers to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer more efficient or lower cost services 
in addition  certain established retailers may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
for example  manufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the internet generally  or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives 
the adoption by manufacturers of policies  or the adoption of new laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations by government authorities  in each case discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet  could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our websites 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brands 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers  which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on favorable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our sites 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  or search engines could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict access to our sites  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
search engines are increasingly becoming a starting point for online shopping  and as the costs of operating an online store continue to decline  online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels  which could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites 
paypal the markets for paypal product are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change  including but not limited to mobile payments  electronic funds transfer networks starting to allow internet access  cross border access to networks  creation of new networks  expansion of prepaid cards  and bill pay networks 
paypal competes with existing online and offline payment methods  including  among others payment card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants  including american express  chase paymentech  first data  and wells fargo  and payment gateways  including cybersource which visa has acquired and authorize 
net which has merged with cybersource  money remitters such as moneygram  western union  global payments  inc and euronet  bill payment services  including checkfree  a subsidiary of fiserv  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit  including acculynk  moneta  ebillme  revolution money which american express has acquired and telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders  and automated clearing house transactions  issuers of stored value targeted at online payments  including visabuxx  netspend and greendot  mobile payments  including obopay  amazon payments  crandy  luup and payforit  amazon payments  which offers online merchants the ability to accept credit card and bank funded payments from amazon base of online customers on the merchant own website  google checkout  which enables the online payment of merchants using credit cards  payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming  including facebook and hi credits  playspan  boku and zong  payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account  including zashpay from fiserv and popmoney from cashedge  and online shopping services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider  such as visa rightcliq  mastercard marketplace  trialpay and tapjoy 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
some of these competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing  anti money laundering  and other regulatory requirements than paypal  which is subject to additional regulations based on  among other factors  its licensure as a bank in luxembourg 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
for example  google checkout has offered free payments processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain advertising spending with google 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
overseas  paypal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods 
in each country  numerous banks provide standard online payment card acquiring and processing services  and these banks typically have leading market share 
in addition  paypal faces competition from visa visa direct  mastercard moneysend  royal bank of scotland world pay  moneybookers  clickandbuy and ukash in the eu  nochex in the united kingdom  sofort berweisung in germany  certapay and hyperwallet in canada  paymate  bpay  poli and visa payclick in australia  alipay  yeepay and bill in china  and inicis in south korea 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany and australia  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
some of paypal competitors  such as wells fargo  first data  american express and royal bank of scotland  also provide processing or foreign exchange services to paypal 
if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers  either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition  these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be negatively affected  or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for paypal to deliver its services 
we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 
we receive scrutiny from various government agencies under us and foreign competition laws 
some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti competitive conduct 
other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
contractual agreements with buyers  sellers  or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation 
also  our unilateral business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation 
some regulators  particularly those outside of the us  may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive 
for example  in the us  we have been sued by a plaintiff representing a putative class of sellers who alleges that we have illegally monopolized a market for online auctions 
see item legal proceedings below 
in korea  the national competition authority has investigated allegations that we have engaged in illegal exclusive conduct and rendered a decision against us in october the case is on appeal through two administrative lawsuits  and a further investigation is now being conducted by the prosecutor office 
the competition authorities in germany and australia have conducted investigations now completed of various actions taken by our businesses 
such claims and investigations  even if without foundation  typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort  and could result in significant judgments against us 
in several jurisdictions  we have taken actions designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites 
beginning in june  we have required users in the uk to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized uk website  and since october  we have required sellers on ebay 
com to accept one or more accepted payment methods currently paypal  credit or debit cards processed through internet merchant accounts  propay  moneybookers and paymate and no longer allow any forms of paper payment  including checks and money orders  to be listed by sellers in the us for most categories of items 
while these initiatives are intended to improve and make safer our users buying experience and or increase activity on our sites  certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes  and may allege that we have and are abusing market power 
we currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to such actions 
for example  both the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia recently reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods 
we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future 
negative reactions to these changes by our users or government authorities could  among other things  force us to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business  operating results and profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites  including seasonal factors  national events and increased usage of other websites 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes 
similarly  our results of operations historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
in addition  increased usage of social networking or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our failure to cost effectively manage certain aspects of our business could harm us 
we have expanded our headcount  facilities  and infrastructure in the us and internationally  and anticipate that further expansion in certain areas will be required for some of our businesses 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational  and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following website stability 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce 
this upgrade process is expensive  and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements 
failure to upgrade our technology  features  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure in a cost effective manner to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume or changes to our site functionality could harm our business 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible apis and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems  and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites 
further  steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive  reduce our margins  and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
customer account billing 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our and our subsidiaries websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue 
customer service 
we continue to focus on providing better and more efficient customer support to our users 
we intend to provide an increased level of support including an increasing amount of telephone support in a cost effective manner 
if we are unable to provide customer support in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  our costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease 
we must continue to effectively hire  train  and manage new employees 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing  and integrating these new employees  or if we are unsuccessful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
like many other multinational corporations  we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate 
our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities  and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations  audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world  including with respect to our tax structure 
any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities  these reserves may prove to be insufficient in the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our positions 
in addition  the economic downturn has reduced tax revenues for us federal and state governments  and proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities are being considered at various levels of government 
among the options have been a range of proposals included in the tax and budget policies recommended to the us congress by the us department of the treasury to modify the federal tax rules related to the imposition of us federal corporate income taxes for companies operating in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
if such proposals are enacted into law  this could increase our effective tax rate 
a number of us states have likewise attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence in order to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state 
many us states are also altering their apportionment formulas in order to increase the amount of taxable income loss attributable to their state from certain out of state businesses 
companies that operate over the internet  such as ebay  are a target of some of these state efforts 
if more states were successful in applying direct taxes to internet companies that are not present in the state  this could increase of our effective tax rate 
there are risks associated with our indebtedness 
at december   we had billion in unsecured indebtedness outstanding  as well as billion of available borrowing capacity under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including under our revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities 
our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences  including  without limitation  the following we will be required to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required to  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce 
the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
concerns about fraud  privacy  and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet as a medium of commerce 
in countries such as the us  germany  korea and the us  where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our services is high  acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer internet analogues to such traditional retail means to our offerings  such as the retailer own website 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services  which could adversely impact our business 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our trademarks  copyrights  patents  domain names  trade dress  and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights in the us and internationally  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available  and contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  domain name  trade dress  and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location 
we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property  including land and buildings related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  disruptions to our operations resulting from possible natural disasters  interruptions in utilities and similar events  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the commercial property markets  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability law  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or take control of our board of directors 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder as defined by delaware law for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item b unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we own and lease various properties in the us and other countries around the world 
we use the properties for executive and administrative offices  data centers  product development offices and customer service offices 
as of december   our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we owned approximately million square feet of space in the us in the following locations denver  colorado  south jordan and draper  utah  omaha  nebraska  phoenix  arizona  and san jose  california  as well as approximately acres of land in utah that could be developed if necessary to accommodate future growth 
as of december   we also maintained approximately million square feet of leased facilities throughout the us  and approximately million square feet of leased facilities internationally in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  czech republic  denmark  france  germany  india  ireland  israel  italy  japan  korea  luxembourg  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  norway  poland  singapore  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  thailand  turkey and the united kingdom 
as of december   the total square footage generally used by each of our marketplaces and payments segments was approximately million and million  respectively 
our corporate headquarters located in san jose  california  occupy approximately million square feet 
from time to time we consider various alternatives related to long term facilities needs 
while we believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs  it may become necessary to develop and improve land we own or lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth 
item legal proceedings in august  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture filed two lawsuits in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
among other things  the complaint alleged that we violated french tort law by negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks and by purchasing certain advertising keywords 
around september  parfums christian dior  kenzo parfums  parfums givenchy  and guerlain soci t also filed a lawsuit in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
the complaint alleged that we had interfered with the selective distribution network the plaintiffs established in france and the european union by allowing third parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our websites 
in june  the paris court of commerce ruled that ebay and ebay international ag were liable for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network 
the court awarded plaintiffs approximately eur million in damages and issued an injunction enforceable by daily fines of up to eur  prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the dior  guerlain  givenchy and kenzo brands over all worldwide ebay sites to the extent that they are accessible from france 
we appealed this decision  and in september  the paris court of appeal reduced the damages award to eur million and modified the injunction 
we have further appealed this decision to the french supreme court 
in  plaintiffs filed an action regarding our compliance with the original injunction  and in november  the court awarded the plaintiffs eur million the equivalent of eur  per day and indicated that as a large internet company we could do a better job of enforcing the injunction 
parfums christian dior has filed another motion relating to our compliance with the injunction 
we have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings  noting  among other things  the modification of the initial injunction 
however  these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers 
any such results could materially harm our business 
other luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so in numerous different jurisdictions  seeking to hold us liable for  among other things  alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by third parties  tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our websites by third parties  alleged misuse of trademarks in listings  alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws  alleged violations of parallel import laws  alleged non compliance with consumer protection laws or in connection with paid search advertisements 
we have prevailed in some of these suits  lost in others  and many are in various stages of appeal 
we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in may  the uk high court of justice ruled in the case filed by l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie  laboratoire garnier cie and l or al uk ltd against ebay international ag  other ebay companies  and several ebay sellers no 
hcco that ebay was not jointly liable with the seller co defendants as a joint tortfeasor  and indicated that it would certify to the european court of justice questions of liability for the use of l or al trademarks  hosting liability  and the scope of a possible injunction against intermediaries 
the uk high court of justice certified a number of issues to the european court of justice and a hearing before the european court of justice on the certified issues took place in june a decision is expected in the case was originally filed in july l or al complaint alleged that we were jointly liable for trademark infringement for the actions of the sellers who allegedly sold counterfeit goods  parallel imports and testers not for resale products 
additionally  l or al claimed that ebay use of l or al brands on its website  in its search engine and in sponsored links  and purchase of l or al trademarks as keywords  constitute trademark infringement 
the suit sought an injunction preventing future infringement  full disclosure of the identity of all past and present sellers of infringing l or al goods  and a declaration that our verified rights owner vero program as then operated was insufficient to prevent such infringement 
other damages claimed are to be specified after the liability stage of the proceedings 
in april  the us second circuit court of appeals upheld the decision of the trial court that ebay was not liable to tiffany co 
for direct or contributory trademark infringement and that generalized knowledge of alleged counterfeiting was not sufficient to cause intermediaries to be liable where there was no willful blindness by the intermediary to the problem 
the us supreme court denied certiorari with respect to this decision in late in march  a plaintiff filed a purported antitrust class action lawsuit against ebay in the western district of texas alleging that ebay and its wholly owned subsidiary paypal monopolized markets through various anticompetitive acts and tying arrangements 
the plaintiff alleged claims under sections and of the sherman act  as well as related state law claims 
in april  the plaintiff re filed the complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california no 
cv rs  and dismissed the texas action 
the complaint seeks treble damages and an injunction 
in  the case was consolidated with other similar lawsuits no 
cv jf 
in june  we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
in march  the court granted the motion to dismiss the tying claims with leave to amend and denied the motion with respect to the monopolization claims 
plaintiffs subsequently decided not to refile the tying claims 
the plaintiffs motion on class certification and our motion for summary judgment were heard by the court in december in march  the district court granted our motion for summary judgment  denied plaintiffs motion for class certification as moot  and entered judgment in our favor 
plaintiffs have appealed the district court decision  and the matter is fully briefed before the ninth circuit court of appeals 
we intend to vigorously oppose plaintiffs appeal 
in october  partsriver filed a lawsuit in the eastern district of texas no 
cv df alleging that ebay  microsoft  yahoo  shopzilla  pricegrabber and pricerunner infringed its patent relating to search methods 
the suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement  unspecified damages  and interest  costs  and fees 
the us district court for the eastern district of texas granted defendants motion to transfer venue and moved the case to the us district court for the northern district of california 
in august  the district court granted our motion for summary judgment and ruled that the partsriver patent was invalid based on a finding that it was on sale more than a year before the filing date of the patent 
partsriver appealed the district court decision to the federal circuit court of appeals  but then voluntarily dismissed its appeal and requested that the court of appeals vacate the district court ruling that the patent was invalid 
the court of appeals dismissed partsriver appeal  but remanded to the district court consideration of partsriver request to vacate its earlier decision 
in parallel with defense of the litigation  we also challenged the validity of the patent in reexamination proceedings before the us patent and trademark office pto 
before the court of appeals issued its decision in the litigation  the pto issued a reexamination certificate for the patent  which was issued with several new claims  although the original claims on which ebay was sued were held invalid 
partsriver then conveyed some interest in these newly issued claims to another entity named kelora 
we then filed a declaratory judgment action against partsriver and kelora with the district court concerning these newly issued claims 
the district court has set a hearing for march to discuss partsriver request to vacate its earlier decision and ebay declaratory judgment action 
ebay korean subsidiary  iac  has notified its approximately million users of a january data breach involving personally identifiable information including name  address  resident registration number and some transaction and refund data but not including credit card information or real time banking information 
approximately  users have sued iac over this breach in several lawsuits in korean courts and more may do so in the future 
trial for a group of four representative suits began in august in the seoul district court  and trial for a group of other suits began in september in the seoul district court 
there is some precedent in korea for a court to grant consolation money for data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the breach 
such precedents have involved payments of up to approximately per user 
in january  the seoul district court ruled that iac had met its obligations with respect to defending the site from intrusion and  accordingly  had no liability for the breach 
this ruling has been appealed by approximately  plaintiffs to the seoul high court  where it is currently being heard de novo 
a decision is expected in other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we are subject to additional patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect that we may face additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces and payments businesses 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts  and as we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable

you should read the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
overview we have two business segments marketplaces and payments 
our marketplaces segment provides the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety of platforms  including the ebay 
com platform and its localized counterparts and our other online platforms  such as our online classifieds businesses  our secondary tickets marketplace stubhub  our online shopping comparison website shopping 
com  our apartment listing service platform rent 
com  and our fixed price media marketplace half 
com 
our payments segment is comprised of our online payment solutions paypal and bill me later 
historically  we also had a communications segment that consisted of skype technologies sa skype 
on november   we sold skype to an investor group for cash  a subordinated note and an equity stake in the outstanding capital stock of the skype successor entity now approximately 
accordingly  skype operating results are not consolidated in our results 
however  skype results of operations are consolidated in our and results through the date of sale 
our non controlling interest in skype is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
our proportionate share of the net income loss of skype is recognized on a one quarter lag as a component of interest and other income expense  net in our consolidated statement of income 
overall  net revenues increased to billion in compared to billion in excluding revenue from skype sold in november of million  net revenues would have increased  from billion in to billion in these increases were driven by net revenue growth of and in our payments and marketplaces businesses  respectively 
we achieved an operating margin of in compared to in  driven primarily by the impact of a skype related legal settlement charge in and lower amortization costs associated with our acquired intangible assets 
diluted earnings per share decreased to in compared to in driven primarily by the gain on sale of skype  partially offset by the impact of a skype related legal settlement charge in operating cash flow decreased to billion in from billion in overall  net revenues increased to billion in compared to the increase was driven primarily by paypal offset by a decline in revenues generated from our marketplaces business 
we achieved an operating margin of in compared to in driven by the impact of a skype related legal settlement charge  acquisitions and foreign currency movements against the us dollar 
diluted earnings per share increased to in compared to in driven primarily by the gain on the sale of skype 
operating cash flow increased to billion in from billion in some key operating metrics that members of our senior management regularly review to evaluate our financial results include free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  net  market share  net promoter score nps and revenue  excluding acquisitions and foreign currency impact 
some key operating metrics specific to our marketplaces business include gross merchandise value gmv  gmv excluding vehicles and number of sold items 
some key operating metrics specific to our payments business include net charge off rate  net number of payments  net total payment volume tpv and risk adjusted margin 
outlook we expect our payments business to continue its strong performance from expanded merchant coverage and share of checkout while generating increased operating leverage 
in addition  we expect marketplaces to have a solid performance in its core markets driven by continued progress in trust  value and selection 
from a macroeconomic perspective  we expect a stable outlook on the overall economy and market growth 
results of operations net revenues we generate two types of net revenues net transaction revenues and marketing services and other revenues 
our net transaction revenues are derived principally from listing fees and final value fees which are fees payable on transactions completed on our marketplaces trading platforms  fees paid by merchants for payment processing services and  until the sale of skype on november   fees charged to users to connect skype internet communications products to traditional fixed line and mobile telephones 
our marketing services revenues are derived principally from the sale of advertisements  revenue sharing arrangements  classifieds fees and lead referral fees 
our other revenues are derived principally from interest earned on certain paypal customer account balances  interest and fees earned on the bill me later portfolio of receivables from loans and from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users 
we generate the majority of our revenues internationally 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations 
we have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies  however  the effectiveness of this program in mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations varies from period to period  and in any given period our operating results are usually affected  sometimes significantly  by changes in currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in exchange rates also directly affect our cross border revenue 
we calculate the year over year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts

shelf registration statement and long term debt at december   we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities  such as fixed or floating rate notes  us dollar or foreign currency denominated notes  redeemable notes  global notes  and dual currency or other indexed notes 
issuances under the shelf registration will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued 
the registration statement does not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder 
our ability to issue debt securities is subject to market conditions and other factors impacting our borrowing capacity  including compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement 
in october  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured debt securities under the shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering 
these debt securities consisted of million aggregate principal amount of notes due  million aggregate principal amount of notes due and million aggregate principal amount of notes due collectively  the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears at the respective per annum rates  and the notes mature on october of the respective years indicated in the preceding sentence 
the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued includes customary covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur  assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to specified properties  and also includes customary events of default 
commercial paper program 
in november  we implemented a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to billion at any time outstanding 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes were outstanding and the weighted average interest rate on those notes was per annum and the weighted average remaining term on our commercial paper notes was days 
liquidity and capital resource requirements at december   we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents  as well as time deposits and fixed income securities classified as short term investments  in an aggregate amount of billion  compared to billion at december  at december   we held assets of these types outside the us in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately billion 
if these assets were distributed to the us  we may be subject to additional us taxes in certain circumstances 
we actively monitor these assets  primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or money market funds fail or encounter difficulties 
to date  we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program  and our access to the capital markets  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  anticipated capital expenditures  bill me later portfolio of receivables from loans and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings 
for example  in  we completed a legal entity restructuring that resulted in a cash payment for taxes of approximately million in the first quarter of we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions  including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives  the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure  as well as the long term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses 
these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and or result in additional cash tax payments 
the impact in any period may be significant 
these transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate 
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes 
changes in our business needs  contractual cancellation provisions  fluctuating interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands payments due during the year ending december  debt operating leases purchase obligations total thereafter debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments 
for additional details related to our debt  please see note debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 
purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services  construction contracts and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits  net  the table does not include million of such non current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in europe  we have two cash pooling arrangements with a financial institution for cash management purposes 
these arrangements allow for cash withdrawals from this financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held in europe within the same financial institution aggregate cash deposits 
these arrangements also allow us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed upon limit 
the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income 
as of december   we had a total of billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the same financial institution under these cash pooling arrangements 
based on differences in regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where paypal operates  paypal holds customer balances either as direct claims against paypal or as an agent or custodian on behalf of paypal customers 
customer balances held as direct claims against us  primarily paypal  are included on our consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and customer accounts with an offsetting current liability in funds payable and amounts due to customers  and totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and customer funds held by paypal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these funds include funds held on behalf of us customers that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation subject to applicable limits and funds that us customers choose to invest in the paypal money market fund  which totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the paypal money market fund is invested in a portfolio managed by blackrock fund advisors 
indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business  we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  which are indemnities mainly related to various intellectual property rights 
in our paypal business  we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal or paypal customers 
in connection with the sale of skype  we made certain customary warranties to the buyer in the purchase agreement 
our liability to the buyer for inaccuracies in these warranties is generally subject to certain limitations 
with respect to certain specified litigation matters involving skype that were pending as of the closing of the transaction  we also agreed  among other things  to bear of the cost of any monetary judgment that is rendered in respect of those matters 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification and other provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses primarily consists of bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance  paypal transaction loss expense  and loan reserves associated with our bill me later principal loan receivable balance  as well as our losses resulting from our ebay and paypal customer protection programs 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience  actuarial techniques  the age and delinquency rates of receivables  the credit quality of the relevant loan  charge off rates  and economic and regulatory conditions 
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction and loan losses as a percentage of net revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  net revenues provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses as a of net revenues determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and is subject to numerous estimates and judgments  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
an aggregate basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million in  resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss  net of expected recoveries  and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item a risk factors  item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of either or both of our business segments 
accounting for income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings 
in addition to local country tax laws and regulations  our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 
at december   billion of earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the u 
s  primarily in active non us business operations 
we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations 
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors  including our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the following table illustrates our effective tax rates for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  various state tax authorities and other various foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million  resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue transactions  primarily related to advertising contracts  that are considered multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables  developing an estimate of the stand alone selling price of each deliverable  whether revenue should be reported gross as ebay is acting as a principal  or net as ebay is acting as an agent  when we provide cash consideration to our customers  determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer purchase of our products and or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred 
changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets  net totaled million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august  and as a result of this test we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required 
see note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as of december   we determined that no events or circumstances from august  through december  indicated that a further assessment was necessary 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards over the service period for awards expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
see note stock based and employee savings plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant 
we calculated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of additional variables described below 
the use of a black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of assumptions  including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
as a result  future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during  and was   and per share  respectively  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected life in years dividend yield expected volatility our computation of expected volatility for  and was based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our stock 
our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
recent accounting pronouncements see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure an increasing proportion of our operations are conducted outside the us our foreign currency exposure continues to grow as we grow internationally 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 
in our view  our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation 
transaction exposure around the world  we have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we may enter into foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts economically offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
transaction gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recognized each period in interest and other income expense  net included in our consolidated statement of income 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses related to these foreign exchange contracts of approximately million 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
at december   the fair value of these contracts resulted in a net asset position of approximately million 
economic exposure we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to foreign currency risk 
in addition  we charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and by paypal 
these charges are generally denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure 
we purchase foreign exchange contracts  generally with maturities of months or less  to reduce the volatility of cash flows related primarily to forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
these foreign currency contracts that we designate as cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate 
accordingly  the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
during the year ended december   we realized net gains on these cash flow hedge contracts of approximately million which were reported as part of paypal net revenues 
the notional amount of our economic hedges was billion as of december  of which billion was designated for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
at december   the fair value of these economic hedge contracts resulted in a net asset position of approximately million 
translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our non us dollar denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase foreign exchange contracts or other instruments to economically offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such non designated foreign exchange contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income expense  net 
during the year ended december   we recognized net losses related to these non designated foreign exchange contracts of approximately million 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position at the end of december   was a net translation gain of approximately million 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
as of december   approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in bank deposits and money market funds 
as such  changes in interest rates will impact interest income 
additionally  changes in interest rates will impact our interest rate sensitive credit agreement and accordingly  impact interest expense or cost of net revenues 
as of december   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the balance of our fixed income investments was billion  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned an average pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our total fixed income investment portfolio as of december  could decrease increase by approximately million 
investment risk as of december   our cost and equity method investments totaled million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio and was primarily related to our retained equity interest in skype 
these investments relate primarily to equity method investments in private companies 
we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other than temporary 
our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends  recent sales acquisitions of the investee securities  and other publicly available data 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on marketable equity instruments due to market volatility 
at december   the total fair value of our marketable equity instruments was million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio and was primarily related to our equity holdings in mercadolibre
