recent developments litigation settlement during  the company entered into an agreement to settle all claims associated with the previously disclosed qui tam action brought by jon h 
oberg on behalf of the united states of america 
as a result of the settlement  the company recorded a million pre tax charge during the third quarter of on november   the company paid the million settlement 
the company expects that the internal revenue service the irs will review the settlement agreement as part of its normal procedures for settlements with government agencies  to determine if the payments are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses 
while the company believes that the payments are fully deductible under applicable tax law  the irs may not agree with that position 
the company believed it had strong defenses to the oberg complaint  but entered into the settlement agreement in order to eliminate the uncertainty  distraction  and expense of a trial 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for additional information related to this settlement 
legislation ffelp on march   president obama signed into law the reconciliation act of effective july   this law prohibits new loan originations under the ffel program and requires that all new federal loan originations be made through the federal direct loan program 
the new law does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing ffelp loans 
as a result of the reconciliation act of  the company no longer originates new ffelp loans 
as such  subsequent to  the company will no longer recognize a gain from originating and subsequently selling ffelp loans to the department under the department s purchase program 
during and  the company recognized pre tax gains of million and million  respectively  from selling billion of ffelp loans to the department during each of these years under the purchase program 
in addition  as a result of the reconciliation act of  net interest income on the company s existing ffelp loan portfolio  as well as fee based revenue from guarantee and third party ffelp servicing and education loan software licensing and consulting fees related to the ffel program  will decline over time as the company s and the company s customers ffelp loan portfolios are paid down 
during and  the company recognized approximately million and approximately million  respectively  of net interest income on its ffelp loan portfolio  approximately million and approximately million  respectively  in guarantee and third party ffelp servicing revenue  and approximately million and approximately million  respectively  in education loan software licensing and consulting fees related to the ffel program 
due to the legislative changes in the student loan industry  the company believes there will be opportunities to purchase ffelp loan portfolios and or expand its current level of guarantee and third party ffelp servicing volume on behalf of current ffelp participants looking to adjust their ffelp businesses 
continue to grow and diversify fee based revenue the company has expanded products and services generated from businesses that are not dependent upon the ffel program  thereby reducing legislative and political risk related to the education lending industry 
revenues from these businesses are primarily generated from products and services offered in the company s tuition payment processing and campus commerce and enrollment services operating segments 
in addition  in september  the company began servicing federally owned student loans for the department 
the amount of federally owned student loans originated through the federal direct loan program is expected to increase substantially  which will lead to an increase in servicing volume and related revenue for the company 
as shown below  revenue earned from the company s fee based operating segments has grown million in compared to year ended december  change change student loan and guaranty servicing a tuition payment processing and campus commerce enrollment services total revenue from fee based businesses a the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment included million and million of revenue earned from rehabilitation collections on defaulted loans in and  respectively 
student loan and guaranty servicing expected revenue growth in june  the company was one of four private sector companies awarded a student loan servicing contract by the department to provide additional servicing capacity for loans owned by the department 
these loans include federal direct loan program loans originated directly by the department and ffel program loans purchased by the department 
the contract spans five years  with one five year renewal at the option of the department 
in september  the department began assigning ffel purchased loans to the four servicers 
beginning with the second year of servicing in june  the department began allocating new loan volume originated under the federal direct loan program among the four servicers based on five equally weighted performance metrics 
three metrics measure the satisfaction among separate customer groups  including borrowers  financial aid personnel at postsecondary schools participating in the federal student loan program  and federal student aid and other federal agency personnel or contractors who work with the servicers 
two performance metrics measure the success of default prevention efforts as reflected by the percentage of borrowers and percentage of dollars in each servicer s portfolio that go into default 
based on the first year of survey results  the company will be allocated of the new loan volume originated by the department for the period from august  through august  the second year of the servicing contract 
the department projects it will originate new loans for million borrowers in total during the second year of this contract  which will then be allocated to the four servicers 
as of december   the company was servicing billion of loans for million borrowers under this contract 
during  the company earned million in revenue under this contract 
the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment also develops student loan servicing software  which is used internally by the company and also licensed to third party student loan holders and servicers 
in addition  the company is offering a hosted servicing software solution to third parties that can be used by third parties to service various types of student loans including federal direct program and ffel program loans 
currently  the company has agreements with third parties  including a contract with an incumbent direct loan program service provider  to add more than million borrowers to its hosted servicing software solution by the end of manage operating costs as shown below  excluding the litigation settlement  the cost to provide enrollment services  restructure and impairment charges  and collection costs related to loan rehabilitation revenue  operating expenses increased million in compared with this increase is due to incurring additional costs to support the increase in revenue at the company s fee based operating segments 
a significant portion of the increase is due to an increase in operating costs in the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment as a direct result of supporting the government servicing volume increase 
year ended december  change change salaries and benefits other expenses a operating expenses  excluding the litigation settlement  the cost to provide enrollment services  restructure and impairment charges  and collection costs related to loan rehabilitation revenue litigation settlement cost to provide enrollment services restructure expense impairment expense collection costs related to loan rehabilitation revenue b total operating expenses a excludes the litigation settlement  the cost to provide enrollment services  restructure and impairment charges  and collection costs related to loan rehabilitation revenue 
b the company incurred collection costs directly related to revenue earned from rehabilitation loans 
these costs are included in professional and other services in the consolidated statements of income and are shown separately in the above table for comparability purposes for the periods shown 
impairment charges included in operating expenses in is an impairment charge related to the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test  the company recorded impairment charges at two reporting units included in the enrollment services operating segment 
these charges consisted of million related to its interactive marketing business and million related to its list marketing business 
recent legislation and related public scrutiny has negatively affected current and projected enrollments at for profit schools 
these factors may impact future revenue  operating margins  and cash flows related to the company s interactive marketing business 
the company s list marketing business continues to be negatively affected by the economic recession and deterioration of the direct to consumer market 
maximize the value of existing portfolio fixed rate floor income loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or the sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company earns additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company earns floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income 
the company s core student loan spread variable student loan spread including fixed rate floor contribution and variable student loan spread net interest margin excluding fixed rate floor income is summarized below 
a the interest earned on the majority of the company s ffelp student loan assets is indexed to the three month commercial paper index 
the company funds the majority of its assets with three month libor indexed floating rate securities 
the relationship between these two indices has a significant impact on student loan spread 
this table the right axis shows the difference between the average three month libor and commercial paper indices 
as reflected in the previous table  the company s core and variable student loan spread increased in compared with the company s variable student loan spread increased in as a result of the tightening of the commercial paper rate  which is the primary rate the company earns on its student loan portfolio  and the libor rate  which is the primary rate the company pays to fund its student loan assets 
the primary difference between variable student loan spread and core student loan spread is fixed rate floor income 
a summary of fixed rate floor income and its contribution to core spread follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net fixed rate floor income contribution to spread  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during and are due to historically low interest rates 
if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk  which provides additional detail on the company s portfolio earning fixed rate floor income and the derivatives used by the company to hedge these loans 
future cash flow from portfolio the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets  thereby minimizing liquidity risk 
in addition  due to i the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  and ii the excess servicing and administration fees the company earns from these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
as of december   based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion as detailed below 
the forecasted cash flow presented below includes all loans currently funded in asset backed securitizations 
as of december   the company had billion of loans included in asset backed securitizations  which represented percent of its total ffelp student loan portfolio classified as held for investment 
the forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows that the company expects to receive related to loans funded through the department s conduit program and other warehouse facilities or loans originated and or acquired subsequent to december  a the company uses various assumptions  including prepayments and future interest rates  when preparing its cash flow forecast 
these assumptions are further discussed below 
prepayments the primary variable in establishing a life of loan estimate is the level and timing of prepayments 
prepayment rates equal the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect estimated prepayment rates  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  management may revise its assumptions  which in turn would impact the projected future cash flow 
the company s cash flow forecast above assumes prepayment rates that are generally consistent with those utilized in recent asset backed securities transactions 
if management used a prepayment rate assumption two times greater than what was used to forecast the cash flow  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
interest rates the company funds the majority of its student loans with three month libor libor indexed floating rate securities 
meanwhile  the interest earned on the company s student loan assets are indexed primarily to a commercial paper rate cp 
the different interest rate characteristics of the company s loan assets and liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk 
the company s cash flow forecast assumes libor will exceed cp by basis points for the life of the portfolio  which approximates the historical relationship between these indices 
if the forecast is computed assuming a spread of basis points between cp and libor for the life of the portfolio  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
the company uses the current forward interest rate yield curve to forecast cash flows 
a change in the forward interest rate curve would impact the future cash flows generated from the portfolio 
an increase in future interest rates will reduce the amount of fixed rate floor income the company is currently receiving 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of a rise in short term rates by hedging interest rate risks 
as of december   the net fair value of the company s interest rate derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income was a negative million 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
ffelp academic year originations during  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million when it sold billion of academic year loans to the department under the department s purchase program 
use liquidity to capitalize on market opportunities the company has used and will continue to use its improved liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities  including debt repurchases  student loan purchases  and stock repurchases  as discussed further below 
debt repurchases during  the company used operating cash to repurchase outstanding debt as summarized below 
due to improvements in the capital markets  the opportunities for the company to repurchase debt at less than par are becoming more limited 
year ended december  notional amount purchase price gain asset backed securities junior subordinated hybrid securities total student loan purchases during  the company purchased billion par value of student loans 
the company believes there will be additional opportunities to purchase ffelp loan portfolios and or expand its current level of guarantee and third party ffelp servicing volume from current ffelp participants looking to modify their involvement and or exit the market 
stock repurchases during  the company repurchased and retired million shares of its class a common stock for million average price per share of subsequent use of liquidity unsecured debt subsequent to december   the company used operating cash to repurchase million par value of junior subordinated hybrid securities for million 
the company recognized a pre tax gain of million as a result of this debt repurchase  which will be included in the company s operating results for the quarter ending march  in addition  subsequent to december   the company paid million on its unsecured line of credit 
after making these payments  as of february   the outstanding balance on the company s unsecured line of credit was million 
results of operations the company s operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing portfolio and the revenues generated by its fee based businesses and the costs to provide such services 
the performance of the company s portfolio is driven by net interest income and losses related to credit quality of the assets along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt 
net interest income the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from the spread  referred to as its student loan spread  between the yield the company receives on its student loan portfolio and the cost of funding these loans 
this spread income is reported on the company s consolidated statements of income as net interest income 
the amortization of loan premiums and discounts  including capitalized costs of origination  the per year consolidation loan rebate fee paid to the department  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s consolidated statements of income 
the amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated prior to april  earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department of education and the borrower rate 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated on or after april  earns interest at a variable rate based on the sap formula 
for the portfolio of loans originated on or after april   when the borrower rate exceeds the variable rate based on the sap formula  the company must return the excess to the department 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet is very important to its operations 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the company s interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the effects of changing interest rate environments are further outlined in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
investment interest income  which is a component of net interest income  includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and investments and funds in the company s special purpose entities which are utilized for its asset backed securitizations 
net interest income also includes interest expense on unsecured debt offerings 
the proceeds from these unsecured debt offerings were used by the company to fund general business operations and certain asset and business acquisitions 
provision for loan losses management estimates and establishes an allowance for loan losses through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management maintains the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans at a level believed to be appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the federal government guarantees of the principal of and the interest on federally insured student loans disbursed on and after july  and for those loans disbursed prior to july   which limits the company s loss exposure on the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
student loans disbursed prior to october  are fully insured 
in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
other income the company also earns fees and generates revenue from other sources as summarized below 
student loan and guaranty servicing revenue loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are calculated based on the dollar value of loans  number of loans  or number of borrowers serviced for each customer

the operational and internal reporting changes included moving the majority of software and information technology products and services and related expenses to the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment 
the internal and external revenue and expenses related to these products and services were historically included within corporate activities and the former software and technical services operating segment 
the software and technical services operating segment no longer meets the definition of an operating segment as described in the segment reporting topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification 
prior period segment operating results were restated to conform to the current period presentation 
the accounting policies of the company s operating segments are the same as those described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
intersegment revenues are charged by a segment to another segment that provides the product or service 
intersegment revenues and expenses are included within each segment consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management 
changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information 
in  the company began allocating certain corporate overhead expenses to the individual operating segments 
these expenses include certain corporate activities related to executive management  human resources  accounting  legal  occupancy  and marketing 
these costs are allocated to each operating segment based on estimated use of such activities and services 
these allocations were not made in and  and thus are not reflected in the and segment operating results 
the management reporting process measures the performance of the company s operating segments based on the management structure of the company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
management  including the company s chief operating decision maker  evaluates the performance of the company s operating segments based on their profitability 
as discussed further below  management measures the profitability of the company s operating segments based on base net income 
accordingly  information regarding the company s operating segments is provided based on base net income 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operating segments 
accordingly  the tables presented below reflect base net income which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the company s operating segments 
reconciliation of the segment totals to the company s consolidated operating results in accordance with gaap are also included in the tables below 
included below under non gaap performance measures is further discussion regarding base net income and its limitations  including a table that details the differences between base net income and gaap net income by operating segment 
income taxes for the years ended december  and  income taxes are applied based on of income loss before taxes for each individual operating segment 
the difference between the consolidated income tax expense and the sum of taxes calculated for each operating segment is included in income taxes in corporate activities 
for the year ended december   income taxes for each individual operating segment are applied based on the consolidated effective tax rate 
reclassifications certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the reclassifications were made to change the income statement presentation to provide the users of the financial statements additional information related to the operating results of the company 
these reclassifications include reclassifying the company s gains on debt repurchases to gain on sale of loans and debt repurchases  net which were previously included in other income 
in addition  during  management changed its internal reporting related to intersegment revenue and expenses 
these changes included reclassifying all intersegment revenue with the exception of intersegment servicing revenue earned by the student loan and guaranty servicing segment from the asset generation and management segment to intersegment expenses  net 
other than intersegment servicing revenue  the intersegment activity is primarily the allocation of operating expenses to the appropriate segment 
the reclassification described above had no effect on any of the segments net income or assets and liabilities

non gaap performance measures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  the company prepares financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management also evaluates the company s operating segments on a non gaap performance measure referred to as base net income for each operating segment 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income to manage each operating segment because management believes these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop financial plans  establish corporate performance targets  allocate resources  track results  evaluate performance  and determine incentive compensation 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a base net income basis by operating segment  as these are the measures used regularly by the company s chief operating decision maker 
the company s board of directors utilizes base net income to set performance targets and evaluate management s performance 
the company also believes analysts  rating agencies  and creditors use base net income in their evaluation of the company s results of operations 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company utilizes base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons by eliminating the temporary volatility in the company s performance that arises from certain items that are primarily affected by factors beyond the control of management 
management believes base net income provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operations 
limitations of base net income while gaap provides a uniform  comprehensive basis of accounting  for the reasons discussed above  management believes that base net income is an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the company s results of operations 
nevertheless  base net income is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider 
for example  as stated above  unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
investors  therefore  may not be able to compare the company s performance with that of other companies based upon base net income 
base net income results are only meant to supplement gaap results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely monitored and used by the company s management and board of directors to assess performance and information which the company believes is important to analysts  rating agencies  and creditors 
other limitations of base net income arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to gaap results to derive base net income results 
these differences are described below 
the adjustments required to reconcile from the company s base net income measure to its gaap results of operations relate to differing treatments for derivatives  foreign currency transaction adjustments  and certain other items that management does not consider in evaluating the company s operating results 
the following table reflects adjustments associated with these areas by operating segment and corporate activity and overhead student tuition loan payment asset corporate and processing generation activity guaranty and campus enrollment and and servicing commerce services management overhead total year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives income from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap a for and  income taxes are applied based on of income loss before income taxes for the individual operating segments 
for  income taxes for each individual operating segment are applied based on the consolidated effective tax rate 
differences between gaap and base net income management s financial planning and evaluation of operating results does not take into account the following items because their volatility and or inherent uncertainty affect the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and base net income follows 
derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments base net income excludes the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the change in fair value on derivatives used in the company s risk management strategy in which the company does not qualify for hedge treatment under gaap 
as such  the company recognizes changes in fair value of derivative instruments currently in earnings 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments primarily used by the company to manage interest rate risk includes interest rate swaps and basis swaps 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company does not qualify its derivatives for hedge treatment  and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the company believes these point in time estimates of asset and liability values that are subject to interest rate fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against its business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
included in base net income are the economic effects of the company s derivative instruments  which includes any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual derivative settlements 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
base net income excludes the foreign currency transaction gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the company s euro denominated bonds to us dollars 
in connection with the issuance of the euro denominated bonds  the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  the principal payments on the euro denominated notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect at the issuance date of the bonds 
the cross currency interest rate swaps also convert the floating rate paid on the euro denominated bonds euribor index to an index based on libor 
included in base net income are the economic effects of any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual settlements of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
however  the gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds to us dollars and the change in market value of the cross currency interest rate swaps are excluded from base net income as the company believes the point in time estimates of value that are subject to currency rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds generally correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
in  base net income also excluded the change in fair value of put options issued by the company for certain business acquisitions 
the put options were valued by the company each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
therefore  the fair value of those options were primarily affected by the strike price and term of the underlying option  the company s stock price  and the dividend yield and volatility of the company s stock 
the company believed those point in time estimates of value that were subject to fluctuations made it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plans and affected the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
in  the company settled all of its obligations related to these put options 
the gains and or losses included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income are primarily caused by interest rate and currency volatility  as well as the volume and terms of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
base net income excludes these unrealized gains and losses and isolates the effect of interest rate and currency volatility related to the fair value of such instruments during the period 
under gaap  the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments but not the underlying hedged item tend to show more volatility in the short term 
amortization of intangible assets base net income excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles  which arises primarily from the acquisition of definite life intangible assets in connection with the company s acquisitions  since the company feels that such charges do not drive the company s operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
compensation related to business combinations the company has structured certain business combinations in which the consideration paid has been dependent on the sellers continued employment with the company 
as such  the value of the consideration paid is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the term of the applicable employment agreement 
base net income excludes this expense because the company believes such charges do not drive its operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
if the company did not enter into the employment agreements in connection with the acquisition  the amount paid to these former shareholders of the acquired entity would have been recorded by the company as additional consideration of the acquired entity  thus  not having an effect on the company s results of operations 
the compensation expense related to these existing agreements was fully expensed in variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives loans that reset annually on july can generate excess spread income compared with the rate based on the special allowance payment formula in declining interest rate environments 
the company refers to this additional income as variable rate floor income 
the company excludes variable rate floor income  net of settlements paid on derivatives used to hedge student loan assets earning variable rate floor income  from its base net income since the timing and amount of variable rate floor income if any is uncertain  it has been eliminated by legislation for all loans originated on and after april   and it is in excess of expected spreads 
in addition  because variable rate floor income is subject to the underlying rate for the subject loans being reset annually on july  it is a factor beyond the company s control which can affect the period to period comparability of results of operations 
discontinued operations in may  the company sold edulinx 
as a result of this transaction  the results of operations for edulinx are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company presents base net income excluding discontinued operations since the operations and cash flows of edulinx have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company

student loan spread analysis the following table analyzes the student loan spread on the company s portfolio of student loans and represents the spread on assets earned in conjunction with the liabilities and derivative instruments used to fund the assets 
year ended december  variable student loan yield consolidation rebate fees premium discount and deferred origination costs amortization variable student loan net yield student loan cost of funds interest expense student loan cost of funds derivative settlements variable student loan spread variable rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives fixed rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives core student loan spread average balance of student loans average balance of debt outstanding a trend analysis of the company s core and variable student loan spreads is summarized below 
a the interest earned on the majority of the company s ffelp student loan assets is indexed to the three month commercial paper index 
the company funds the majority of its assets with three month libor indexed floating rate securities 
the relationship between these two indices has a significant impact on student loan spread 
this table shows the difference between the average three month libor and commercial paper indices 
the company s variable student loan spread was impacted primarily by the following items the tightening widening of the cp libor spread increases decreases variable student loan spread 
historically  the movement of the various interest rate indices received on the company s student loan assets  primarily three month commercial paper  and paid on the debt to fund such loans  primarily libor  was highly correlated 
the short term movement of these indices was dislocated beginning in august which negatively impacted the company s net interest income through the first half of beginning in the third quarter of  the cp libor spread began to tighten to more historical levels  which had a positive impact on spread 
in  the average cp libor spread was basis points compared to basis points in which resulted in an improved variable student loan spread in compared with a decrease in the amortization of loan premiums discounts and deferred origination costs as a result of loans purchased at a discount  which reduced the net costs being amortized 
the primary difference between variable student loan spread and core student loan spread is fixed rate floor income  net of settlements on derivatives 
a summary of fixed rate floor income and its contribution to core student spread follows year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net fixed rate floor income contribution to spread  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income 
the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during and are due to historically low interest rates 
if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods

the decrease in yield was partially offset by a billion increase in the average student loan portfolio balance in compared to student loan interest  net of settlements on derivatives for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the same period in due to a decrease in the yield earned on student loans in compared to and  respectively  which was a result of lower interest rates and a decrease in derivative settlements 
additionally  a billion decrease in the average student loan portfolio balance in compared to also contributed to the decrease in student loan interest 
b consolidation rebate fees decreased million and million for the years ended december  and  compared to the same periods in and  respectively  due to decreases in the average consolidation loan portfolio  for which such fees are paid 
c amortization of loan premiums discounts and deferred origination costs decreased million for the year ended december  compared with due to the purchase of loans at a discount which has reduced the net costs being amortized 
these same costs decreased million for the year ended december  compared with due to a reduction in costs incurred to acquire or originate loans 
d interest expense decreased million in compared with and decreased million in compared with  due to a decrease in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt  which lowered the company s cost of funds excluding net derivative settlements 
the student loan cost of funds were in  in  and in the decrease in interest expense in from is also attributable to the company s billion decrease in average debt in the same period 
e depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate on student loans is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income 
a summary of fixed rate floor income follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during and are due to historically low interest rates 
f investment income decreased million in compared with and million in compared with  due to a decrease in interest rates earned on cash  as well as a decrease in the average cash held over the same periods 
g the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the company s portfolio of loans 
the provision for loan losses recognized by the company decreased in compared to  primarily due to the provision related to the company s non federally insured student loan portfolio 
during  the company increased its allowance for non federally insured loans due to management projected performance of the portfolio in light of economic conditions 
as of december   the dollar amount of the company s non federally insured student loan portfolio  including those loans in repayment and loans delinquent  decreased from the same period a year ago 
these decreases  as well as continued aging of the portfolio  resulted in less provision expense recognized by the company during as compared to related to the company s non federally insured portfolio 
h the company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective  however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the company s net interest income 
other income 
the following table summarizes the components of other income 
year ended december  borrower late fee income other other income gain loss on sale of loans and debt repurchases  net

in  the company recorded a million loss as a result of the sale of billion par value of student loans in order to reduce the company s exposure related to certain equity support provisions included in the company s ffelp warehouse facility  through which such loans were funded 
b during the years ended december  and  the company repurchased asset backed securities of million and million  respectively  resulting in the gains included in gain on debt repurchases shown in the table above 
salaries and benefits and other expenses 
salaries and benefits and other expenses decreased in compared with and compared with as a result of continued focus by the company on managing costs and gaining efficiencies as well as a reduction in marketing costs due to the elimination of new loan originations under the ffel program 
included in other expenses in is million in fees paid related to liquidity contingency planning and a million restructure charge 
intersegment expenses 
intersegment expenses includes fees paid to the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment for the servicing of the company s student loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s fee generating businesses are non capital intensive and all produce positive operating cash flows 
as such  a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to the fee based segments and any liquidity or capital needs are satisfied using cash flow from operations 
therefore  the liquidity and capital resources discussion is concentrated on the company s liquidity and capital needs to meet existing debt obligations  primarily unsecured corporate debt and debt facilities in the asset generation and management operating segment 
the company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital  increase liquidity  refinance upcoming maturities  or provide for general corporate purposes 
moreover  the company may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding secured and unsecured debt securities  including debt securities which the company may issue in the future  for cash and or through exchanges for other securities 
such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material 
the company has historically utilized operating cash flow  secured financing transactions which include warehouse facilities  asset backed securitizations  and liquidity programs offered by the department  operating lines of credit  and other borrowing arrangements to fund its asset generation and management operations and student loan acquisitions 
in addition  the company has used operating cash flow  borrowings on its unsecured line of credit  and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities  business acquisitions  and repurchases of common stock 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
the company has a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which allows the company to sell up to million of securities that may consist of common stock  preferred stock  unsecured debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts  and stock purchase units 
the terms of any securities are established at the time of the offering

these notes are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the credit market conditions continue to improve  the company anticipates selling these notes to third parties 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these subordinated notes and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
b the company has repurchased its own asset backed securities bonds and notes payable 
for accounting purposes  these notes are effectively retired and are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  as of december   million of these securities are legally outstanding at the trust level and the company could sell these notes to third parties or redeem the notes at par as cash is generated by the trust estate 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these notes and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
cash generated from operations in addition to current sources of liquidity  the company plans to use cash generated from operations to satisfy its unsecured debt obligations 
the company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations 
for the years ended   and the company had net cash flow from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
liquidity needs and sources of liquidity available to satisfy debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral the company had the following debt obligations outstanding that are secured by student loan assets and related collateral 
as of december  carrying amount final maturity asset generation and management bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations ffelp warehouse facility department of education conduit related party debt other borrowings bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets  thereby minimizing liquidity risk 
in addition  due to i the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  and ii the excess servicing and administration fees the company earns from these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
as of december   based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion as detailed below 
the forecasted cash flow presented below includes all loans currently funded in asset backed securitizations 
as of december   the company had billion of loans included in asset backed securitizations which represented percent of its total ffelp student loan portfolio classified as held for investment 
the forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows that the company expects to receive related to loans funded through the department s conduit program and other warehouse facilities or loans originated and or acquired subsequent to december  a the company uses various assumptions  including prepayments and future interest rates  when preparing its cash flow forecast 
these assumptions are further discussed below 
prepayments the primary variable in establishing a life of loan estimate is the level and timing of prepayments 
prepayment rates equal the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect estimated prepayment rates  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  management may revise its assumptions  which in turn would impact the projected future cash flow 
the company s cash flow forecast above assumes prepayment rates that are generally consistent with those utilized in recent asset backed securities transactions 
if management used a prepayment rate assumption two times greater than what was used to forecast the cash flow  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
interest rates the company funds the majority of its student loans with three month libor libor indexed floating rate securities 
meanwhile  the interest earned on the company s student loan assets are indexed primarily to a commercial paper rate cp 
the different interest rate characteristics of the company s loan assets and liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk 
the company s cash flow forecast assumes libor will exceed cp by basis points for the life of the portfolio  which approximates the historical relationship between these indices 
if the forecast is computed assuming a spread of basis points between cp and libor for the life of the portfolio  the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately million to million 
the company uses the current forward interest rate yield curve to forecast cash flows 
a change in the forward interest rate curve would impact the future cash flows generated from the portfolio 
an increase in future interest rates will reduce the amount of fixed rate floor income the company is currently receiving 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of a rise in short term rates by hedging interest rate risks 
as of december   the net fair value of the company s interest rate derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income was a negative million 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
ffelp warehouse facility on july   the company renewed its ffelp warehouse facility 
the ffelp warehouse facility has a maximum financing amount of million  with a revolving financing structure supported by day liquidity provisions  which expire on july  the final maturity date of the facility is july  in the event the company is unable to renew the liquidity provisions by july   the facility would become a term facility at a stepped up cost  with no additional student loans being eligible for financing  and the company would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by july  the ffelp warehouse facility provides for formula based advance rates depending on ffelp loan type up to a maximum of percent to percent of the principal and interest financed 
the advance rates for collateral may increase or decrease based on market conditions  but they are subject to a minimum advance of to percent based on loan type 
the facility contains financial covenants relating to levels of the company s consolidated net worth  ratio of adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest  and unencumbered cash 
any violation of these covenants could result in a requirement for the immediate repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the ffelp warehouse facility and million was available for future use 
as of december   the company had million advanced as equity support in the facility 
upon termination or expiration of the facility  the company would expect to access the securitization market  use operating cash  rely on sale of assets  or transfer collateral to satisfy any remaining obligations 
department of education conduit in may  the department implemented a program under which it finances eligible ffelp stafford and plus loans in a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for student lenders the conduit program 
loans eligible for the conduit program had to be first disbursed on or after october   but not later than june   and fully disbursed before september   and meet certain other requirements 
funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates  with the company being advanced percent of the student loan face amount 
excess amounts needed to fund the remaining percent of the student loan balances were contributed by the company 
the conduit program expires on may  the student loan short term notes student loan notes issued by the conduit program are supported by a combination of i notes backed by ffelp loans  ii a liquidity agreement with the federal financing bank  and iii a put agreement provided by the department 
if the conduit does not have sufficient funds to pay all student loan notes  then those student loan notes will be repaid with funds from the federal financing bank 
the federal financing bank will hold the notes for a short period of time and  if at the end of that time  the student loan notes still cannot be paid off  the underlying ffelp loans that serve as collateral for the conduit program will be sold to the department through a put agreement at a price of percent of the face amount of the loans 
as of december   the company had billion borrowed under the facility and million advanced as equity support in the facility 
beginning july   no additional loans can be funded using the conduit program 
the company expects to access the securitization market prior to the conduit program s maturity to refinance the student loan collateral included in the conduit with debt that is structured to match the maturity of the assets 
related party debt the company has from time to time repurchased its own asset backed securities 
for accounting purposes  these notes have been effectively retired and are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  these securities are legally outstanding at the trust level and the company could sell these notes to third parties or redeem the notes at par as cash is generated by the trust estate 
during  the company participated million of these securities to union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  and obtained cash proceeds equal to the par value of the notes 
the company has entered into a guaranteed purchase agreement with union bank whereby the company must purchase these notes back from union bank at par upon the request of union bank 
as of december   million of these securities were outstanding and subject to the participation agreement 
upon termination or expiration of this participation  the company would expect to use operating cash or rely on the sale of assets to satisfy this debt 
other liquidity needs on march   president obama signed into law the reconciliation act of effective july   this law prohibits new loan originations under the ffel program and requires that all new federal loan originations be made through the federal direct loan program 
as a result of the reconciliation act of  the company no longer originates new ffelp loans 
due to the legislative changes in the student loan industry  the company believes there will be opportunities to purchase ffelp loan portfolios on behalf of current ffelp participants looking to adjust their ffelp businesses 
for example  during  the company purchased billion of ffelp student loans from various third parties 
the company plans to fund ffelp student loan acquisitions from third parties using its agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans as described below  using its ffelp warehouse facility as described above  and continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
union bank participation agreement the company maintains an agreement with union bank  as trustee for various grantor trusts  under which union bank has agreed to purchase from the company participation interests in student loans the ffelp participation agreement 
the company has the option to purchase the participation interests from the grantor trusts at the end of a day period upon termination of the participation certificate 
as of december   million of loans were subject to outstanding participation interests held by union bank  as trustee  under this agreement 
the agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days notice 
this agreement provides beneficiaries of union bank s grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans  while providing liquidity to the company on a short term basis 
the company can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million or an amount in excess of million if mutually agreed to by both parties 
loans participated under this agreement have been accounted for by the company as loan sales 
accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
asset backed securities transactions depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
asset backed securities transactions would be used to refinance student loans included in the ffelp warehouse facility  the department of education conduit facility  and or existing asset backed security transactions 
the ffelp warehouse facility and department conduit facility have advance rates that are less than par 
as of december   the company had million advanced as equity support in the ffelp warehouse facility and million advanced as equity support in the department conduit facility 
depending on the terms of asset backed security transactions  refinancing loans included in these facilities could produce positive cash flow to the company by reducing required advance rates and are contemplated by management when making student loan financing decisions 
during  the company completed asset backed securities transactions totaling billion 
the company used the proceeds from the sale of these notes to purchase student loans  including loans previously financed in other asset backed securitizations and the ffelp warehouse facility 
although the company has demonstrated its ability to access the asset backed securities market in and and expects asset backed securities transactions to remain a primary source of funding over the long term  the company also expects its transaction volumes to be more limited and pricing less favorable than prior to the credit market dislocation that began in august  with significantly reduced opportunities to place subordinated tranches of asset backed securities with investors 
at present  while the markets have demonstrated some signs of recovery  the company is unable to predict when market conditions will allow for more regular  reliable  and cost effective access to the term asset backed securities market 
description of other debt facilities unsecured line of credit the company has a million unsecured line of credit that terminates in may as of december  and february  there was million and million outstanding  respectively  on this line 
upon termination in  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this line of credit  find alternative funding  or increase the amount outstanding under the line  if necessary 
the lending commitment under the company s unsecured line of credit is provided by a total of thirteen banks  with no individual bank representing more than of the total lending commitment 
the bank lending group includes lehman brothers bank  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc  which represents approximately of the lending commitment under the line of credit 
in september  lehman brothers holdings inc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the company does not expect lehman to fund future borrowing requests 
as of december  and february   excluding lehman s lending commitment  the company had million and million  respectively  available for future use under its unsecured line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that  if not met  lead to an event of default under the agreement 
the covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth a minimum adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest over the last four rolling quarters a limitation on subsidiary indebtedness a limitation on the percentage of non guaranteed loans in the company s portfolio as of december   the company was in compliance with all of these requirements 
many of these covenants are duplicated in the company s other lending facilities  including its ffelp warehouse facility 
a default on the ffelp warehouse facility would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 
the company s operating line of credit does not have any covenants related to unsecured debt ratings 
however  changes in the company s ratings as well as the amounts the company borrows have modest implications on the pricing level at which the company obtains funding 
junior subordinated hybrid securities in september  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated hybrid securities hybrid securities 
the hybrid securities are unsecured obligations of the company 
the interest rate on the hybrid securities from the date they were issued through the optional redemption date  september   is  payable semi annually 
beginning september  through september   the scheduled maturity date  the interest rate on the hybrid securities will be equal to three month libor plus  payable quarterly 
the principal amount of the hybrid securities will become due on the scheduled maturity date only to the extent that the company has received proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities prior to such date as defined in the hybrid securities prospectus 
if any amount is not paid on the scheduled maturity date  it will remain outstanding and bear interest at a floating rate as defined in the prospectus  payable monthly 
on september   the company must pay any remaining principal and interest on the hybrid securities in full whether or not the company has sold qualifying capital securities 
at the company s option  the hybrid securities are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the redemption price described in the prospectus supplement

under the terms of the purchase agreement  the  shares of class a common stock issued in the acquisition were subject to stock price guaranty provisions whereby if on or about february  the average market trading price of the class a common stock was less than per share and had not exceeded that price for any consecutive trading days during the year period from the closing of the acquisition to february   then the company must pay additional cash to the sellers of infinet for each share of class a common stock issued in an amount representing the difference between less the greater of or the gross sales price such seller obtained from a sale of the shares occurring subsequent to february  as defined in the agreement 
on february   the company paid million in cash to satisfy this obligation which was recorded by the company as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
this payment is not included in the above table 
during  the company purchased certain assets of a software company 
the initial consideration paid by the company was million in cash 
in addition to the initial purchase price  additional payments are to be made by the company based on certain operating results as defined in the purchase agreement 
these contingent payments are payable in three annual installments beginning in march and as of december  are estimated by the company to be a total of million 
the estimated contingency payments are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the contingent payments will be remeasured to fair value each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with all changes in fair value being recognized in earnings 
these contingent payments are not included in the table above 
dividends in the first quarter of  the company began paying dividends of per share on the company s class a and class b common stock which were paid quarterly through the first quarter of on may   the company announced that it was temporarily suspending its quarterly dividend program 
on november   the company s board of directors voted to reinstate the quarterly dividend program effective for the fourth quarter accordingly  a dividend of per share on the company s class a and class b common stock was paid during the fourth quarter of and during the first  second  and third quarters of the nelnet board of directors declared a fourth quarter cash dividend on its outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock of per share 
the dividend consists of a quarterly dividend of per share  and an additional per share representing per share for each of the six quarters in and during which the company had suspended dividend payments to preserve capital during a volatile period in the market 
the dividend was paid on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  the company currently plans to continue making quarterly dividend payments  subject to future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  and other factors 
in addition  the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of the company s outstanding junior subordinated hybrid securities  which generally provide that if the company defers interest payments on those securities it cannot pay dividends on its capital stock 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  impairment assessments related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and accounting for derivatives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data  past experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and discounts and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive and liquidity purposes  the company frequently changes the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the most sensitive estimate for loan premiums discounts  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance  net of scheduled principal payments 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate  including the level of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium discount and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
loan and guaranty servicing revenue loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are calculated based on the dollar value of loans  number of loans  or number of borrowers serviced for each customer 
guaranty servicing fees  generally  are calculated based on the number of loans serviced  volume of loans serviced  or amounts collected 
revenue is recognized when earned pursuant to applicable agreements  and when ultimate collection is assured 
tuition payment processing and campus commerce revenue tuition payment processing and campus commerce revenue primarily includes actively managed tuition payment solutions and online payment processing 
fees for these services are recognized over the period in which services are provided to customers 
enrollment services revenue enrollment services revenue primarily consists of the following items interactive marketing interactive marketing revenue is derived primarily from fees which are earned through the delivery of qualified inquiries or clicks 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified inquiry or click is delivered to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain 
from time to time  the company may agree to credit certain inquiries or clicks if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
the company has established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been immaterial and within management s expectations 
for a portion of its interactive marketing revenue  the company has agreements with providers of online media or traffic publishers used in the generation of inquiries or clicks 
the company receives a fee from its customers and pays a fee to publishers either on a cost per inquiry  cost per click  or cost per number of impressions basis 
the company is the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by the company s customers are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to its publishers are included in cost to provide enrollment services in the company s consolidated statements of income 
list marketing revenue from the sale of lists is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon delivery 
publishing services revenue from the sale of print products is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon shipment or delivery 
resource centers resource centers services include online courses  scholarship search and selection data  career planning  and online information about colleges and universities 
the majority of these services are sold based on subscriptions and or are performance based 
revenues from sales of subscription and performance based services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract as earned 
subscription and performance based revenues received or receivable in advance of the delivery of services is included in deferred revenue 
fees associated with the majority of the services described above are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
the company assesses collectability of revenues and its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of the company s services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually every november and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performs a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each quarter the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of the company s intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and internal forecasts 
although the company believes the historical assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the u 
s and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate 
derivative accounting the company records derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
the company determines the fair value for its derivative contracts using either i pricing models that consider current market conditions and the contractual terms of the derivative contract or ii counterparty valuations 
these factors include interest rates  time value  forward interest rate curve  and volatility factors  as well as foreign exchange rates 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings 
net settlements on derivatives are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu provides amendments to topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  that will provide more robust disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and the transfers between levels   and the update was effective for annual or interim periods beginning after december  january  for the company  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements  which will be effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after december  january  for the company 
to date  the update has not had  and the company does not anticipate the disclosures required about level measurements effective january  to have  a material impact on the preparation of and disclosures in the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  to be included in asc subtopic asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sets forth requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of those current requirements is that there be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by either vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
asu amends asc to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of asu additionally  the new guidance will require entities to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
the update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  january  for the company  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  to be included in asc subtopic asc subtopic  software revenue recognition  addresses the accounting for revenue transactions involving software 
currently  that guidance applies to revenue arrangements for products or services that include software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole 
asu amends asc subtopic to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
the update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  january  for the company  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollars are in thousands  except share amounts  unless otherwise noted interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  a summary of fixed rate floor income follows 
year ended december  fixed rate floor income  gross derivative settlements a fixed rate floor income  net a includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income the high levels of fixed rate floor income earned during and are due to historically low interest rates 
if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning fixed rate interest weighted conversion floor income as of rate range average yield rate a december  a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
as of december   the short term interest rate was basis points 
the following table summarizes the outstanding derivatives instruments used by the company to hedge fixed rate student loan assets 
as of december  weighted average fixed notional rate paid by maturity amount the company a a for all interest rate derivatives  the company receives discrete three month libor 
as of december   the company had billion of student loan assets that were eligible to earn variable rate floor income 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of certain pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities together with the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
derivative instruments used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy currently include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency swaps 
the following table presents the company s ffelp student loan assets and related funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  index frequency of variable resets assets debt outstanding that funded student loan assets a month h financial commercial paper b daily month treasury bill c varies month libor d quarterly month libor e monthly  auction rate or remarketing f varies asset backed commercial paper g varies other h a the company has certain basis swaps outstanding in which the company receives three month libor set discretely in advance and pays one month libor plus or minus a spread as defined in the agreements 
the company entered into these derivative instruments to better match the interest rate characteristics on its student loan assets and the debt funding such assets 
a summary of these derivatives is included in the following table 
as of december  maturity notional amounts a b a this derivative has a forward effective start date in b this derivative has a forward effective start date in b the company s ffelp student loans earn interest based on the daily average h financial commercial paper index calculated on a fiscal quarter 
c the company has used derivative instruments to hedge both the basis and repricing risk on certain student loans in which the company earns interest based on a treasury bill rate that resets daily and are funded with debt indexed to primarily three month libor 
to hedge these loans  the company has entered into basis swaps in which the company receives three month libor set discretely in advance and pays a weekly treasury bill rate plus a spread as defined in the agreement 
the following table summarizes these derivatives as of december  maturity notional amount d the company has euro denominated notes that reprice on the euribor index 
the company has entered into derivative instruments cross currency interest rate swaps that convert the euribor index to three month libor 
as a result  these notes are reflected in the three month libor category in the above table 
see foreign currency exchange risk 
e certain of the company notes issued in are indexed to one month libor 
f the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction auction rate securities or through a remarketing utilizing remarketing agents variable rate demand notes 
as of december   the company is sponsor on million of auction rate securities and million of variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
during the first quarter of  as part of the credit market crisis  auction rate securities from various issuers failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february   the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under normal conditions  banks have historically purchased these securities when investor demand is weak 
however  since february  banks have been allowing auctions to fail 
currently  all of the company s auction rate securities are in a failed auction status and the company believes they will remain in a failed status for an extended period of time and possibly permanently 
as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the indenture 
while these rates will vary  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities 
due to the failed auctions related to these securities  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
g asset backed commercial paper consists of million funded in the company s ffelp warehouse facility and billion funded through the department s conduit program 
funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates 
h assets include restricted cash and investments and other assets 
debt outstanding includes other debt obligations secured primarily by student loan assets and related collateral 
financial statement impact of derivative instruments the company recognizes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
management has structured the majority of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting  consequently  the change in fair value of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates can significantly impact the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts to the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates will impact the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the change in fair value of the company s derivatives are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net in the company s consolidated statements of income and resulted in an expense of million in  income of million in  and an expense of million in the following summarizes the derivative settlements included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the consolidated statements of income year ended december  settlements average discrete basis swaps basis swaps t bill libor basis swaps interest rate swaps floor income hedges interest rate swaps unsecured debt hedges cross currency interest rate swaps other total settlements expense income sensitivity analysis the following tables summarize the effect on the company s earnings  based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by the company assuming hypothetical increases in interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remain constant 
in addition  as it relates to the effect on earnings  a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases basis points and basis points while holding the asset index constant  if the funding index is different than the asset index 
the effect on earnings was performed on the company s variable rate assets including loans earning fixed rate floor income and liabilities 
the analysis includes the effects of the company s interest rate and basis swaps in existence during these periods

as a result of this transaction  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and euro 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date 
changes in the principal and accrued interest amounts as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in the derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of the euro notes 
under the terms of these derivative instrument agreements  the company receives from a counterparty a spread to the euribor index based on notional amounts of million and million and pays a spread to the libor index based on notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  under the terms of these agreements  all principal payments on the euro notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect as of the issuance of the notes 
the company did not qualify these derivative instruments as hedges under accounting authoritative guidance  consequently  the change in fair value is included in the company s operating results 
the following table summarizes the financial statement impact as a result of the remeasurement of the euro notes and change in the fair value of the related derivative instruments 
these amounts are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  re measurement of euro notes change in fair value of cross currency derivatives total impact to statements of operations income expense the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds generally correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
management intends to hold the cross currency interest rate swaps through the maturity of the euro denominated bonds
