see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates 
executive summary we are a leading independent specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing in the us of products for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions 
we also market products in canada for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions and began commercial efforts in europe with our acquisition of liposonix in july we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements  including facial wrinkles  acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
the non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of urea cycle disorder  non invasive body sculpting technology and contract revenue 
our acne and acne related dermatological product lines include dynacin  plexion  solodyn  triaz and ziana 
our non acne dermatological product lines include dysport  loprox  perlane  restylane and vanos 
our non dermatological product lines include ammonul  buphenyl sodium phenylbutyrate powder and tablets  and the liposonix tm system 
our non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing agreements and authorized generic agreements 
financial information about segments we operate in one business segment pharmaceuticals 
our current pharmaceutical franchises are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
information on revenues  operating income  identifiable assets and supplemental revenue of our business franchises appears in the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our revenue from our primary products dysport  perlane  restylane  solodyn  vanos and ziana 
we believe that sales of our primary products will constitute a significant portion of our revenue for we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy promoting existing brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
our core philosophy is to cultivate high integrity relationships of trust and confidence with the foremost dermatologists and the leading plastic surgeons in the us we rely on third parties to manufacture our products except for the liposonix tm system 
we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we estimate customer demand for our non prescription products primarily through internal data that we compile 
we observe trends from these data and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand 
table of contents forecasts that are the basis for our purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for our products 
overestimates of demand and sudden changes in market conditions may result in excessive inventory production and underestimates may result in an inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  miscalculation of customer demand or relatively small delays in our receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
approximately of our gross revenues are typically derived from two major drug wholesale concerns 
depending on the customer  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer  or at the time of receipt by the customer  net of estimated provisions 
as a result of certain amendments made to our distribution services agreement with mckesson  our exclusive us distributor of our aesthetics products dysport  perlane and restylane  we began recognizing revenue on these products upon the shipment from mckesson to physicians beginning in the second quarter of consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
we have distribution services agreements with our two largest wholesale customers 
we review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers by reviewing periodic inventory reports that are supplied to us by our major wholesalers in accordance with the distribution services agreements 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our prescription products 
we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products  based on our review of the periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and the estimated demand for our products based on prescription and other data  are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our prescription products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our prescription products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure that the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at wholesale and drugstore customers 
we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail chain drugstore customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
from time to time we may enter into business arrangements eg  loans or investments involving our customers and those arrangements may be reviewed by federal and state regulators 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 
in addition  we consistently assess our product mix and portfolio to promote a high level of profitability and revenues and to ensure that our products are responsive to consumer tastes and changes to regulatory classifications 
as a result  we are considering actions to rationalize certain of our current product offerings in the next year

settlement agreement and license agreement with mylan on july   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with mylan inc and certain of its affiliates  as applicable  including matrix laboratories ltd 
and mylan pharmaceuticals inc collectively  mylan whereby we and mylan agreed to terminate all legal disputes between us relating to solodyn

we also granted to mylan a license to make and sell generic versions of solodyn in mg and mg strengths under our solodyn intellectual property rights upon certain conditions  but not upon any specified date in the future 
the license agreement provides that mylan will be required to pay us royalties based on sales of mylan s generic versions of solodyn pursuant to the foregoing licenses 
fda approval of new strengths of solodyn on august   we announced that the fda had approved additional strengths of solodyn in mg  mg and mg dosages for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients years of age and older 
with the addition of these newly approved strengths  solodyn is now available in eight dosages mg  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg and mg 
limited shipment of the newly approved mg  mg and mg products to wholesalers began during september sublicense and development agreement and purchase option with a privately held us biotechnology company on september   we entered into a sublicense and development agreement with a privately held us biotechnology company to develop an agent for specific dermatological conditions in the americas and europe and a purchase option to acquire the privately held us biotechnology company 
under the terms of the agreements  we paid the privately held us biotechnology company million in connection with the execution of the agreement  and will pay additional potential milestone payments totaling approximately million upon successful completion of certain clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones 
during the three months ended december   a development milestone was achieved  and we made a million payment to the privately held us biotechnology company pursuant to the development agreement 
the initial million payment and the million milestone payment were recognized as research and development expense during the year ended december  impairment of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its present value of anticipated cash flows  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
when it is determined that the useful life of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we will accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives 

table of contents during the year ended december   long lived assets related to certain of our products were determined to be impaired based on our analysis of the long lived assets carrying value and projected future cash flows 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we recorded a write down of approximately million related to these long lived assets 
this write down included the following in thousands intangible assets related to liposonix tm property and equipment related to liposonix tm intangible asset related to non primary products factors affecting the future cash flows of the liposonix tm long lived assets include the current regulatory and commercial capital equipment environment  which have included delays in the regulatory approval process and competitive products entering the market

in addition  as a result of the impairment analysis  the remaining amortizable life of the intangible asset was reduced to five months 
the intangible asset became fully amortized on february  subsequent events on february   we entered into a research and development agreement with anacor for the discovery and development of boron based small molecule compounds directed against a target for the potential treatment of acne 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid anacor million in connection with the execution of the agreement  and will pay up to million upon the achievement of certain research  development  regulatory and commercial milestones  as well as royalties on sales by us

our effective tax rate for included the impact of no tax benefit being recorded on the charge associated with the reduction in carrying value of our investment in revance or on the in process research and development charge related to our investment in liposonix 
as of december   the cumulative million reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment is currently an unrealized loss for income tax purposes 
we will not be able to determine the character of the loss until we exercise or fail to exercise our option 
a realized loss characterized as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains 
we recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss to reduce the carrying value to  which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized

although more of the customers purchases during the fourth quarter of occurred during the last month of the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of  their total purchases for the fourth quarter of were consistent with previous quarters 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
we have distribution services agreements with our two largest wholesale customers 
we review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers by reviewing periodic inventory reports that are supplied to us by our major wholesalers in accordance with the distribution services agreements 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our prescription products 
we also defer the recognition of revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand  and we defer the recognition of revenue of our aesthetics products dysport  perlane and restylane  until our exclusive us distributor  mckesson  ships these products to physicians 
there has not been a significant increase in inventories in the distribution channel during the year ended december  inventories  net  increased million  or from million at december  to million at december  raw materials inventory increased million  from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to a planned increase to a six month manufacturing supply from a three month supply of raw materials for solodyn  to ensure no disruption in supply based on current demand levels 
finished goods inventory increased million  from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the addition of inventory of restylane l and perlane l  which were approved by the fda on january  management believes existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
our cash and short term investments are available for dividends  milestone payments related to our product development collaborations  strategic investments  acquisitions of companies or products complementary to our business  the repayment of outstanding indebtedness  repurchases of our outstanding securities and other potential large scale needs 
in addition  we may consider incurring additional indebtedness and issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments  to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
on july   we acquired liposonix  an independent  privately held company with a staff of approximately scientists  engineers and clinicians located near seattle  washington 
liposonix  now known as medicis technologies corporation  is a medical device company developing non invasive body sculpting technology 
its first product  the liposonix tm system  is currently marketed and sold through distributors in europe and japan  and direct to practitioners in canada 
in the us  the liposonix tm system is an investigational device and is not currently cleared or approved for sale 
under the terms of the transaction  we paid million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of liposonix 
in addition  we will pay liposonix stockholders certain milestone payments up to an additional million if various commercial milestones are achieved on a worldwide basis 
as of december   our investments included million of auction rate floating securities 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
during the three months ended march   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for the auction rate floating securities  and since that time we have been unable to liquidate our holdings in such securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered 
table of contents illiquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity or until a future auction on these investments is successful 
as a result of the continued lack of liquidity of these investments  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter of on our auction rate floating securities  based on our estimate of the fair value of these investments 
on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb released fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp fas  effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  upon adoption  fsp fas  which is now part of asc  investments debt and equity securities  requires that entities should report a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the non credit component of previously recognized other than temporary impairments on debt securities held at that date from retained earnings to other comprehensive income if the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we adopted fsp fas during the three months ended june   and accordingly  we reclassified million of previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses  net of income taxes  related to our auction rate floating securities from retained earnings to other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets during the three months ended june  during and  we liquidated million and million  respectively  of our auction rate floating securities at par 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million during the year ended december  the following is a summary of the primary components of cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  and in millions payments made to a privately held us biotechnology company related to a development agreement payment made to a medicis partner related to a development agreement payment made to revance related to a development agreement payments made to impax related to a development agreement payments made to perrigo related to a development agreement payment made to glenmark related to a development agreement and license and settlement agreements income taxes paid other cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was approximately million  compared to net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   of million 
the change was primarily due to the net purchases and sales of our short term and long term investments during the respective periods 
during  we paid million to ipsen upon the fda s approval of dysport  and we received million upon the sale of medicis pediatrics to biomarin  which closed in june financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  dividends paid during the year ended december   were million  compared to dividends paid during the year ended december   of million 

table of contents contingent convertible senior notes and other long term commitments we have two outstanding series of contingent convertible senior notes  consisting of million principal amount of contingent convertible senior notes due the old notes and million principal amount of contingent convertible senior notes due the new notes 
the new notes and the old notes are unsecured and do not contain any restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and do not contain any financial covenants 
the old notes do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the new notes require an adjustment to the conversion price if the cumulative aggregate of all current and prior dividend increases above per share would result in at least a one percent increase in the conversion price 
this threshold has not been reached and no adjustment to the conversion price has been made 
on june  and  or upon the occurrence of a change in control  holders of the old notes may require us to offer to repurchase their old notes for cash 
on june  and  or upon the occurrence of a change in control  holders of the new notes may require us to offer to repurchase their new notes for cash 
except for the new notes and old notes  we had only million of long term liabilities at december   and we had million of current liabilities at december  our other commitments and planned expenditures consist principally of payments we will make in connection with strategic collaborations and research and development expenditures  and we will continue to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure 
in connection with occupancy of the new headquarter office during  we ceased use of the prior headquarter office  which consists of approximately  square feet of office space  at an average annual expense of approximately million  under an amended lease agreement that expired in december under asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
we recorded lease exit costs of approximately million during the three months ended september   consisting of the initial liability of million and accretion expense of million 
these amounts were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we have not recorded any other costs related to the lease for the prior headquarters  other than accretion expense 
as of december   the amended lease agreement has expired and we have made all of our required payments under the terms of the lease 
the following is a summary of the activity in the liability for lease exit costs for the year ended december  liability as of amounts charged cash payments cash received liability as of december  to expense made from sublease dec 
 lease exit costs liability dividends we do not have a dividend policy 
prior to july  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
since july  we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock 
in addition  on december   we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock payable on january   to our stockholders of record at the close of business on january  any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  operating results  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
fair value measurements we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our auction rate floating security investments  which totaled million at december  these securities were included in long term investments at december  
table of contents our auction rate floating securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under asc  fair value measurements and disclosure 
however  due to events in credit markets that began during the first quarter of  the auction events for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  we determined the estimated fair values of these securities  beginning in the first quarter of  utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and the expectation of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level during the first quarter of  and we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter of on our auction rate floating securities  based on our estimate of the fair value of these investments 
our estimate of fair value of our auction rate floating securities was based on market information and estimates determined by our management  which could change in the future based on market conditions 
in accordance with a new accounting standard which is now part of asc  investments debt and equity securities  during the three months ended june   we reclassified million of previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses  net of income taxes  related to our auction rate floating securities from retained earnings to other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets during the three months ended june  in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with the broker through which we purchased auction rate floating securities 
the settlement agreement provided us with the right to put an auction rate floating security held by us back to the broker beginning on june  at june  and december   we held one auction rate floating security with a par value of million that was subject to the settlement agreement 
at inception  we elected the irrevocable fair value option treatment under asc  financial instruments  and accordingly adjusted the put option to fair value at each reporting date 
concurrent with the execution of the settlement agreement  we reclassified this auction rate floating security from available for sale to trading securities 
this auction rate floating security was sold at par on july  on july   the broker through which we purchased auction rate floating securities agreed to repurchase from us three auction rate floating securities with an aggregate par value of million  at par 
the adjusted basis of these securities was million  in aggregate  as a result of an other than temporary impairment loss of million recorded during the year ended december  the realized gain of million was recognized in other income expense during the three months ended september  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period more than more than year and years and less than less than less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases uncertain income tax positions other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations the long term debt consists of our old notes and new notes 
we may redeem some or all of the old notes and new notes at any time on or after june   and june   respectively  at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
holders of the old notes and new notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june  and and new notes on june  and  or upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture agreements governing the old notes and new notes  at of the principal amount of the old notes and new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
as of december   million of the old notes were classified in the more than year and less than years category as the holders of the old notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june   which is more than year but less than years from the december  balance sheet date 
as of december   million of new notes were classified in the more than year and less than years category as the holders of the new notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their new notes on june   which is more than year but less than years from the december  balance sheet date 
interest on long term debt includes interest payable on our old notes and new notes  assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and  but does not include any contingent interest 
the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table 
the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million  including million of potential future milestone payments related to our research and development agreement with anacor that was executed on february  purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to 
table of contents be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs  based on expected demand  and are fulfilled by our vendors  in most cases  with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we have excluded from the table above approximately million in reserves for uncertain income tax positions  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement with the respective taxing authority will occur  if any 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of part iv of this report  exhibits  financial statement schedules 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from our product sales is recognized pursuant to asc  revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
we do not provide any material forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged  or  depending on the customer and product  if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  and depending on the customer  revenue is recognized based upon shipment fob shipping point or receipt fob destination  net of estimated provisions 
as a result of certain amendments made to our distribution services agreement with mckesson  our exclusive us distributor of our aesthetics products dysport  perlane and restylane  we began recognizing revenue on these products upon the shipment from mckesson to physicians beginning in the second quarter of as a general practice  we do not ship prescription product that has less than months until its expiration date 
we also authorize returns for damaged products and credits for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures 
the shelf life associated with our products is up to months depending on the product 
the majority of our prescription products have a shelf life of approximately months 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of asc 
table of contents items deducted from gross revenue provisions for estimated product returns  sales discounts and chargebacks are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
provisions for managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the later of the date at which revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is offered 
in addition  we defer revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand 
these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves  including but not limited to  prescription data  industry trends  competitive developments and estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements  historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we regularly monitor internal as well as external data from our wholesalers  in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  our internal information regarding our products 
these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  as a reserve within current liabilities  or as an addition to accrued expenses 
we identify product returns by their manufacturing lot number 
because we manufacture in bulk  lot sizes can be large and  as a result  sales of any individual lot may occur over several periods 
as a result  we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or a prior period  and therefore  we cannot specify how much of the provision recorded relates to sales made in prior periods 
however  we believe the process discussed above  including the tracking of returns by lot  and the availability of other internal and external data allows us to reasonably estimate the level of product returns  as well as estimate the level of expected credits associated with rebates or chargebacks 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management 
if the levels of product returns  inventory in the distribution channel  cash discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected

 reserve for sales returns we account for returns of product by establishing an allowance based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future 
we estimate the rate of future product returns for our established products based on our historical experience  the relative risk of return based on expiration date  and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns  such as competitive developments  product discontinuations and our introduction of similar new products 
historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns 
we also estimate inventory in the distribution channel by monitoring inventories held by our distributors  as well as prescription trends to help us assess whether historical rates of return continue to be appropriate given current conditions 
we estimate returns of new products primarily based on our historical acceptance of our new product introductions by our customers and product returns experience of similar products  products that have similar characteristics at various stages of their life cycle  and other available information pertinent to the intended use and marketing of the new product 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide material pricing incentives to our distributors that are intended to have them assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary accrual for future product returns are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties 
we assess the trends that could affect our estimates and make changes to the accrual quarterly when it appears product returns may differ from our original estimates 
the provision for product returns was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for product returns was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease 
table of contents in the provision and the reserve was primarily related to a reduction in product returns experienced from million  or of gross product sales during  to million  or of gross product sales during  and lower levels of inventory in the distribution channel at december   resulting primarily from the impact of distribution services agreements with our two largest wholesalers that we entered into during the provision for product returns was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for product returns increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december  was primarily related to additional estimated required reserves for newly launched products 
if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns increased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december   would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount 
conversely  if the amount of our estimated quarterly returns decreased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december   would decrease by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance between estimated and actual sales returns to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our sales returns reserves 
for newly launched products  if the returns reserve percentage increased by one percentage point  our sales return reserve at december   would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount 
conversely  if the returns reserve percentage decreased by one percentage point  our sales returns reserve at december   would have decreased by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a one percentage point variance between estimated and actual returns reserve percentage to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our sales returns reserves for newly launched products 
we also defer the recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue for certain sales of inventory into the distribution channel that are in excess of eight weeks of projected demand 
the distribution channel s market demand requirement is estimated based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements  who make up a significant majority of our total sales of inventory into the distribution channel 
no adjustment is made for those customers who do not provide inventory information to us 
deferred product revenue associated with estimated excess inventory at wholesalers was approximately million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment  generally approximately of the sales price 
we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers 
we consider payment performance and adjust the allowance to reflect actual experience and our current expectations about future activity 
the provision for cash discounts was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for cash discounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision was due to an increase in gross product sales 
the balance in the reserve for sales discounts at the end of the fiscal year is related to the amount of accounts receivable that is outstanding at that date that is still eligible for the cash discounts to be taken by the customers 
the fluctuations in the reserve for sales discounts between periods are normally reflective of increases or decreases in the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts at the comparable dates 
the provision for cash discounts was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for cash discounts increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase in the provision during the comparable periods was due to an increase in gross product sales 
the increase in the reserve for sales discounts during the year ended december  was due to the increase in 
table of contents the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts as of december  as compared to december  contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities  whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price 
these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices 
we also consider our claim processing lag time  and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
although we record an allowance for estimated chargebacks at the time we record the sale typically when we ship the product  the actual chargeback related to that sale is not processed until the entities purchase the product from the wholesaler 
we continually monitor our historical experience and current pricing trends to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated 
the provision for contract chargebacks was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for contract chargebacks was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the provision for contract chargebacks was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for contract chargebacks increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and the reserve during the year ended december  was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales and in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods 
managed care and medicaid rebates managed care and medicaid rebates are contractual discounts offered to government programs and private health plans that are eligible for such discounts at the time prescriptions are dispensed  subject to various conditions 
we record provisions for rebates based on factors such as timing and terms of plans under contract  time to process rebates  product pricing  sales volumes  amount of inventory in the distribution channel  and prescription trends 
we continually monitor historical payment rates and actual claim data to ensure the liability is fairly stated 
the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision was primarily due to an increase in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods related to solodyn 
the increase in the reserve is due to an increase in the amount of rebates outstanding at the comparable dates  due to the increase in the number of solodyn pricing contracts in place 
the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december  was due to an increase in eligible gross product sales 
consumer rebates and loyalty programs we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and we have consumer loyalty programs 
we generally account for these programs by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the rebate and loyalty incentives attributable to a sale 
we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items on historical experience and other relevant factors 
we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors  if any  to ensure the balance is fairly stated 

table of contents the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision and the reserve was primarily due to new consumer rebate programs initiated during related to our solodyn  ziana  dysport  restylane and perlane products 
the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase in the provision during the comparable periods and in the reserve during the year ended december  was primarily due to the continued growth in consumer rebate programs related to our solodyn  ziana restylane and perlane products  as well as the new dysport challenge program that was in place during most of if our estimates of rebate redemption rates or average rebate amounts for our consumer rebate programs changed by percent  our reserve for consumer rebates would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance in our estimated rebate redemption rates and average rebate amounts to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in estimating our reserve for consumer rebates 
use of information from external sources we use information from external sources to estimate our significant items deducted from gross revenues 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on inventory information reported to us by our major wholesale customers for which we have inventory management agreements  historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we regularly monitor internal data as well as external data from our wholesalers  in order to assess the reasonableness of the information obtained from external sources 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  our internal information regarding our products 
we use the information from ims health  inc to project the prescription demand for our products 
our estimates are subject to inherent limitations pertaining to reliance on third party information  as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates 
use of estimates in reserves we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our related reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues we report 
share based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  we are required to recognize the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a 
table of contents better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
increasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have increased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
conversely  decreasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical experience of awards with similar characteristics 
stock option awards granted during have a stated term of years  and the weighted average expected life of the awards was determined to be years 
decreasing the weighted average expected life by years from years to years would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock appreciation rights sars is adjusted at the end of each reporting period based on updated valuation variables at the end of each reporting period 
the fair value of sars is most affected by changes in the fair market value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period 
we are required to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of was immaterial 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
our estimates of these important assumptions are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to record additional stock based compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if future commercial use and future economic benefit are not considered probable  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit changes due to denial or delay of regulatory approval  a delay in commercialization  or other factors 
conversely  our gross margins could be favorably impacted if previously expensed pre approval inventory becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
as of december   there were no costs capitalized into inventory for products that have not yet received regulatory approval 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant 
table of contents negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its present value of anticipated net cash flows  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
during  an impairment charge of approximately million was recognized related to our review of long lived assets  and the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that was deemed to be impaired was reduced 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for  and or accelerate amortization of  long lived assets 
during and  we did not recognize an impairment charge as a result of our review of long lived assets 
if our estimates of future net revenues and gross profit margin for dysport were both reduced by percent  our intangible asset related to dysport would be impaired by approximately million 
if only our estimates of future net revenues for dysport were reduced by percent  and our estimates of gross profit margin for dysport were reduced by percent or less  our intangible asset related to dysport would not be impaired 
similarly  if only our estimates of gross profit margin for dysport were reduced by percent  and our estimates of future net revenues for dysport were reduced by percent or less  our intangible asset related to dysport would not be impaired 
we consider the sensitivity analysis of a percent variance in our future estimated net revenues and gross profit margin amounts to be representative of the range of other outcomes that we are reasonably likely to experience in assessing the potential impairment of long lived assets 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which generally differs from the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of state and local income taxes  enhanced charitable contribution deductions for inventory  tax credits available in the us  the treatment of certain share based payments that are not designed to normally result in tax deductions  various expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and differences in tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize tax benefits only if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying values to amounts that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
based on our historical pre tax earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of substantially all of the existing net deferred tax assets at december  we believe the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which we generate net taxable income  however  there can be no assurance that we will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits 
we have an option to acquire revance or license revance s topical product that is under development 
through december   we have recorded million of charges related to the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment 
the reduction in the carrying value of the revance investment is currently an unrealized loss for tax purposes 
we will not be able to determine the character of the loss until we exercise or fail to exercise our option 
a realized loss characterized as a capital loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains 
we 
table of contents have recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to  which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we have an option to acquire a privately held us biotechnology company 
through december   we have an unrealized tax loss of million related to this option 
if we fail to exercise our option  a capital loss will be recognized 
a loss characterized as a capital loss can only be used to offset capital gains 
we have recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this unrealized tax loss in order to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to  which is the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and research and development work that has been completed 
these payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 
our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of the recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda approval related directly to the product  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights which are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party will successfully complete its development milestones  we expense such payments 
legal contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
we disclose material contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
in addition to the matters disclosed in item legal proceedings of part i of this report  we are party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of our cash equivalent investments were in money market securities that are reflected as cash equivalents  because all maturities are within days 
included in money market securities are commercial paper  federal agency discount notes and money market funds 
our interest rate risk with respect to these investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates 
our policy for our short term and long term investments is to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was approximately million as of december   and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase 
as of december   our investments included auction rate floating securities with a fair value of million 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the negative conditions in the credit markets during  and have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings  including their holdings of auction rate floating securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now considered illiquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity 
we may not be able to liquidate the securities until a future auction on these investments is successful 
as a result of the lack of liquidity of these investments  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million during on our auction rate floating securities 
during the three months ended june   we adopted fsp fas now part of asc  and accordingly  we reclassified million of this other than temporary impairment loss  net of income taxes  from retained earnings to other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets during the three months ended june  the following table provides information about our available for sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  as well are our contingent convertible senior notes  which have fixed interest rates 
we have aggregated our available for sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollar amounts in thousands interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december  financial instruments mature during year ended december  thereafter available for sale and trading securities weighted average yield rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
we have minimal operations outside of the us and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 
during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and 
table of contents collectability of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
