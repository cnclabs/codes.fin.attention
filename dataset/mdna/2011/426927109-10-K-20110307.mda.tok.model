performance overview during  there were several significant events that impacted the company financial condition and operations the company completed a private placement of convertible preferred stock for million in the second quarter of which significantly improved the company regulatory capital ratios 
during the second quarter of  the company identified million of real estate loans classified as substandard or substandard nonaccrual that it transferred to the held for sale portfolio 
table of contents and the company recorded million of related loan charge offs 
during the third quarter of  million of these loans were sold which resulted in a loss on sale of other loans of  the remaining problem real estate loans held for sale were written down by an additional million during the third quarter of after additional liquidations efforts during the fourth quarter of  problem real estate loans held for sale were reduced to million at december  due to the continued depressed economic conditions and the length of time and amount by which the company book value exceeded the market value per common share  and the company closing of a private placement at a conversion price of per share  the company determined that goodwill related to the acquisition of diablo valley bank of million was fully impaired 
after an analysis in the second quarter of of both the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the deferred tax asset  the company recorded a million partial valuation allowance on the company deferred tax asset 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million and the net loss allocable to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share  which included a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million and loan charge offs of million related to problem real estate loans transferred to loans held for sale in the second quarter of for the year ended december   the net loss was million and the net loss allocable to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share 
for the year ended december   net income was million and net income allocable to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share 
the annualized return loss on average assets and average equity for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the annualized return loss on average tangible assets and average tangible equity for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the following are major factors that impacted the company results of operations net interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in loan balances 
net interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to compression of the net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the net interest margin for compared to was primarily due to an increase in the yields on loans and securities and a decrease in rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in the net interest margin for compared to was primarily due to the basis points decline in short term interest rates from january  through december   with the prime rate remaining at a historically low level of for all of and the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to reflects the decline in the size of the loan portfolio and improvement in credit quality in the latter half of the year 
the significant increase in the provision for loan losses in compared to reflects a higher volume of classified and nonperforming loans and an increase in loan charge offs caused by 
table of contents challenging conditions in commercial lending and the residential housing market  turmoil in the financial markets  and the prolonged downturn in the overall economy 
noninterest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income in compared to was primarily due to million in gains on the sale of securities in  offset by an  loss on sale of other loans 
noninterest income increased by in to million  compared to million in  primarily a result of gains on the sale of sba loans in noninterest expense  excluding the million impairment of goodwill  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to higher fdic deposit insurance costs 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   and an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit for included million of income tax expense in the second quarter of to establish a partial valuation allowance on the company net deferred tax asset 
the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  and tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships 
the following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position cash  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and securities available for sale increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in liquid assets is primarily due to proceeds from the june private placement  proceeds from loan sales  and loan paydowns 
total loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased million  or  to million at december   compared to billion at december  land and construction loans decreased million to million at december  from million at december  in addition  real estate mortgage loans decreased million to million at december  from million at december  classified assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  or of total loans  representing of nonperforming loans and of nonperforming loans excluding nonaccrual loans in loans held for sale 
the allowance for loan losses for december  was million  or of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
nonperforming assets decreased million to million  or of total assets at december   from million  or of total assets at december  net loan charge offs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  brokered deposits decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  
table of contents the ratio of noncore funding which consists of time deposits  and over  cdars deposits  brokered deposits  securities under agreement to repurchase  and short term borrowings to total assets was at december   compared to at december  the liquidity position improved with a loan to deposit ratio of at december   compared to at december  the million of new capital raised in june increased tangible equity to million at december   from million at december  capital ratios substantially exceed regulatory requirements for a well capitalized financial institution  both at the holding company and the bank 
the leverage ratio at the holding company was  with a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  the leverage ratio for hbc was  with a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  the regulatory well capitalized guidelines are a minimum of a leverage ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio  and a total risk based capital ratio 
deposits the composition and cost of the company deposit base are important in analyzing the company net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics 
except for brokered time deposits  the company depositors are generally located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company also obtains deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december   compared to million at december  the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit concentrations 
deposits at december  were million  compared to billion at december  increases in core deposit balances allowed the company to decrease higher cost wholesale funding 
hbc is a member of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
deposits gathered through this program are considered brokered deposits under regulatory guidelines 
deposits in the cdars program totaled million at december   and million at december  liquidity our liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion 
we believe that our liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses  borrowing needs and other obligations for our liquidity has been significantly enhanced from the proceeds from the june private placement  proceeds from loan sales  and loan paydowns 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the federal home loan bank fhlb  the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
the company also had million in unpledged securities available at december  our loan to deposit ratio decreased to at december   compared to at december   primarily due to a million reduction in the loan portfolio 

table of contents lending our lending business originates primarily through our branch offices located in our primary market 
the company also has an additional sba loan production office in santa rosa  california 
as a result of the weakened economy in our primary service area throughout and and loan payoffs  we have seen a contraction in our loan portfolio during the last two years 
the total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial loans accounting for of the portfolio at december  commercial real estate loans accounted for of the total loan portfolio at december   of which were owner occupied by businesses 
land and construction loans continued to decrease  accounting for of the portfolio at december   compared to at december  consumer and home equity loans accounted for the remaining of total loans at december  the decline in gross loans in compared to was primarily due to loans transferred to loans held for sale  diminished loan demand  and loan payoffs exceeding draw downs of loan commitments 
lower volume of loan originations can be attributed in part to lower demand for certain types of credit as well as more selectivity with respect to the types of loans the company chooses to originate 
net interest income the management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail under liquidity and asset liability management 
in addition  we believe there are measures and initiatives we can take to improve the net interest margin  including increasing loan rates  adding floors on floating rate loans  reducing nonperforming assets  managing deposit interest rates  and reducing higher cost deposits 
from january  through december   the board of governors of the federal reserve system reduced short term interest rates by basis points 
this decrease in short term rates immediately affected the rates applicable to the majority of the company loans 
while the decrease in interest rates also lowered the cost of interest bearing deposits  which represents the company primary funding source  these deposits tend to price more slowly than floating rate loans 
the rapid  substantial drop in short term interest rates  including the prime rate  has significantly compressed the company net interest margin 
the company net interest margin expanded in the first half of  as yields on loans and securities increased and the costs of deposits and borrowings continued to decline 
however  the net interest margin decreased in the third and fourth quarters of  primarily due to investment of proceeds from the june capital raise in short term investments and deposits at the federal reserve bank  partially offset by maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a more cost effective blend of core deposits 
the net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short term investments 
management of credit risk we continue to proactively identify  quantify  and manage our problem loans 
early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and ultimate losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
while we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating  circumstances can change at any time for loans 
table of contents included in the portfolio that may result in future losses  that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans 
through established credit practices  we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
however  because future events are uncertain  there may be loans that deteriorate some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame 
as a result  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans  commercial real estate  construction and land development loans with relatively large balances  deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses 
future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as have resulted due to the current  and potentially worsening  economic conditions 
additionally  federal and state banking regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from ours 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect  which may be material  on our financial condition and results of operation 
further discussion of the management of credit risk appears under provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income is an important component 
the company sold million of investment securities for total gross proceeds of million resulting in a million gain on sale of securities for  compared to a  gain on sale of securities for  and no gain on sale of securities in prior to the third quarter of  a significant percentage of the company noninterest income was associated with its sba lending activity  consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained 
from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  the company retained its sba production 
in the third quarter of  the company began to again sell loans in the secondary market 
when the company sells sba loans to third parties  the loans are subject to a day sba warranty 
the company adopted new accounting guidance in the first quarter of that requires the company to treat the sba loans sold as secured borrowings during the warranty period 
the company has million of sba loans that were transferred to third parties during the fourth quarter of provided the loans remain current through the end of the warranty period  all elements necessary to record the sale will have been met 
the company has deferred gains of  associated with these loans  which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the net gain on sales of sba loans was million  compared to million for the year ended december   and no gain for the year ended december  during the third quarter of  the sale of million of problem real estate loans held for sale resulted in net proceeds of million  with a loss on sale of  
table of contents during the second quarter of  the company identified million of problem real estate loans for sale 
these loans were written down by million to reflect the estimated proceeds from the sale  resulting in a net balance of million which was transferred into the loans held for sale portfolio 
the following table shows the detail of the problem loans transferred to the loans held for sale portfolio from june  to december  balance prior to transfer amount charged off june  balance transferred to loans held for sale paydowns sales writedowns december  balance dollars in thousands real estate commercial and residential land and construction total noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company performance 
over the last several quarters  the company has undertaken several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency 
operating expense excluding impairment of goodwill increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a million writedown of loans held for sale and an increase in fdic deposit insurance premiums  partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense 
noninterest expense  excluding the million impairment of goodwill which was recorded in the second quarter of  was million for year ended december   compared to million for year ended december  capital management as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 
on november   the company issued to the us treasury under its capital purchase program  shares of series a preferred stock for million and issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
the terms of the us treasury capital purchase program could reduce investment returns to our shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders  diluting existing shareholders interests  and restricting capital management practices 
under the terms of the capital purchase program with the us treasury  so long as our series a preferred stock is outstanding  we are prohibited from increasing quarterly dividends on our common stock in excess of per share  and from making certain repurchases of equity securities  including our common stock  without the us treasury consent until the third anniversary of the us treasury investment or until the us treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock it purchased under the capital purchase program to third parties 
as long as the series a preferred stock is outstanding  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities  including our common stock  and the series c preferred stock  are also prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
on november   we suspended dividend payments on our series a preferred stock 
as a result  the company has accrued but has not paid approximately million in dividends on its series a preferred stock as of december  the company dividend payment on its outstanding series a preferred stock issued to the us treasury that was due on february  was the sixth consecutive dividend payment suspended 
under 
table of contents the terms of the series a preferred stock  if the company fails to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for a total of six quarters  whether or not consecutive  the us treasury has the right to elect two members of the company board of directors 
these directors would serve on the company board of directors until such time as the company has paid in full all dividends not previously paid 
although the us treasury has not indicated if or when it may exercise its right to have two members appointed to the board of directors  effective during the first quarter of  the company has permitted the us treasury to allow an observer employed by the u 
s 
treasury to attend meetings of the company board of directors 
so long as payment of dividends on the series a preferred stock remain suspended  we may not  among other things and with limited exceptions  pay cash dividends on or repurchase our common stock or preferred stock 
on june   the company issued series b mandatorily convertible cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b preferred stock and series c convertible perpetual preferred stock series c preferred stock to a limited number of institutional investors for an aggregate amount of million 
hcc then downstreamed million of the proceeds from the private placement to the capital of hbc 
after receiving shareholder approval in september  the outstanding series b preferred stock converted into approximately million shares of the company common stock 
the series c preferred stock remains outstanding until converted to common stock upon the transfer of the series c preferred stock in accordance with its terms 
holders of series c preferred stock will receive dividends if and only to the extent dividends are paid to holders of common stock 
we have supported our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying sales of subordinated debt to these trusts 
the subordinated debt that we issued to the trusts is senior to our shares of common stock  series a preferred stock  and series c preferred stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the subordinated debt before any dividends can be paid on our common stock  series a preferred stock  and series c preferred stock 
under the terms of the subordinated debt  we may defer interest payments for up to five years 
on november   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on our million of subordinated debt relating to our trust preferred securities 
as a result the company has accrued but has not paid approximately million in interest on its subordinated debt as of december  so long as interest payments remain deferred  we may not pay cash dividends on or repurchase our common stock or preferred stock 
under the written agreement with our regulators we are required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the director of the division of banking supervision and regulation of the federal reserve to make any interest payments on our outstanding trust preferred securities and related subordinate debt  or to pay any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock 
at december   hbc total risk based capital ratio was  compared to the regulatory requirement for well capitalized banks under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective actions 
hbc tier risk based capital ratio of and leverage ratio of at december  also exceeded regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks under the prompt corrective actions framework 
on a consolidated basis  the company has a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is noninterest income  which primarily consists of gains on the sale of sba loans  loan servicing fees  customer service charges and fees  the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and gains on the 
table of contents sale of securities 
the majority of the company noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products that comprise the company earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid 
the following distribution  rate and yield table presents for each of the past three years  the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company balance sheet  the average interest rates earned or paid thereon  and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated

the yield on interest earning assets decreased by basis points to in from in  primarily due to the investment of proceeds from the june capital raise in short term investments and deposits at the federal reserve bank

table of contents to in from in  as a result of maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a more cost effective blend of core deposits 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased million to million  compared to million a year ago  primarily due to a decrease in average loan balances  partially offset by an increase in average investment securities  an increase in average federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  as well as a lower cost of funds 
net interest income for decreased million from  primarily due to compression of the net interest margin 
the decrease in the net interest margin in compared to was primarily due to the basis points decline in short term interest rates from january  through december   with the prime rate remaining at a historically low level of for all of and the company net interest margin was in  compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
the net interest margin was also lower in due to an increase in nonaccrual loans 
a substantial portion of the company earning assets are variable rate loans that re price when the company prime lending rate is changed  in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company balance sheet to be asset sensitive which means that  all else being equal  the company net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the company allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current quarter expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company earnings 
the provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company market area 
for  the company had a provision for loan losses of million  compared to a provision for loan losses of million for and a provision for loan losses of million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to reflects the decrease in the size of the loan portfolio and improvement in credit quality in the latter half of the year

income tax expense the company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis

table of contents the company has total investments of million in low income housing limited partnerships as of december  these investments have generated annual tax credits of approximately million for the year ended december   and million in each of the years ended december   and some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company tax expense or benefit  which is accumulated on the company books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse 
at the end of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of million  compared to a deferred tax asset of million at the end of  and a net deferred tax asset of million at the end of realization of the company deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and utilization of tax credit carryforwards and the net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california state income tax purposes 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including forecasts of future income  cumulative losses  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at december   based on these factors  the company believed that it was more likely than not that the company will realize approximately million of the benefits of these deductible differences  and therefore  a partial valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million was recorded at december  the million income tax benefit for is net of the million income tax expense to establish the partial valuation allowance 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at december   the company estimated that it had sufficient forecasted future taxable income and various tax planning strategies which could be implemented to generate taxable income in future periods  to support the balance of deferred tax assets 
based on these factors  the company believed it was more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  and therefore  no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was recorded at december  financial condition as of december   total assets were billion  a decrease of from billion at december  total securities available for sale at fair value were million  an increase of from million at december  the total loan portfolio  excluding loans held for sale  was million  a decrease of from billion at year end total deposits were million  a decrease of from billion at year end securities sold under agreement to repurchase decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at year end in addition  short term borrowings were million at december   a decrease of from million at december

the portfolio serves the following purposes i it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  ii it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  and iii it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans 
the company securities are all currently classified under existing accounting rules as available for sale to allow flexibility for the management of the portfolio 
accounting guidance requires available for sale securities to be marked to fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity

the commercial and residential real estate loans at december  consist of million  or  of commercial owner occupied properties  million  or  of commercial investment properties  and million  or  of residential properties 
properties securing the commercial and residential real estate loans are primarily located in the company primary market  which is the greater san francisco bay area 
the company commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
the company generally restricts real estate term loans to no more than of the property appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on real estate mortgage loans are generally between five and ten years with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years and a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company land and construction loans are primarily to finance the development construction of commercial and single family residential properties

loan maturities the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal

since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values including real estate 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
the company policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
the company credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general california market and  particularly  primary local markets 
the company asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  and depressed real estate values 
nonperforming assets are comprised of the following loans and loans held for sale for which the company is no longer accruing interest  restructured loans  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on nonaccrual when they become days past due  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection  and oreo from foreclosures 
management classification of a loan as nonaccrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing interest income  and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income 
the company begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale

loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management judgment  should be charged off 
specific allowances are established for impaired loans 
management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
loans for which the terms have been modified with a concession granted  and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties  are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral  less costs to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent or on the present value of expected future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
if the measure of the impaired loans is less than the 
table of contents investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses if the amount is a confirmed loss  or  alternatively  a specific allocation within the allowance will be established 
loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the formula portion of the allowance for loan losses analysis 
the estimated loss factors for pools of loans that are not impaired are based on determining the probability of default and loss given default for loans within each segment of the portfolio  adjusted for significant factors that  in management judgment  affect collectibility as of the evaluation date 
the company historical delinquency experience and loss experience are utilized to determine the probability of default and loss given default for segments of the portfolio where the company has experienced losses in the past 
for segments of the portfolio where the company has no significant prior loss experience  the company uses quantifiable observable industry data to determine the probability of default and loss given default 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified assets include all loans considered as substandard  substandard nonaccrual  and doubtful and may result from problems specific to a borrower business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate  and oreo 
the principal balance of classified assets  net of sba guarantees  was million at december   million at december   and million at december  included in the million of classified assets at december   were million of loans held for sale 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value  and are not allocated an allowance for loan losses 
management of the level of classified assets will continue to be a focus for executive management  the lending staff and the company special assets department 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis  we have engaged an outside firm to perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process 
based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company market area were to further weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty

the company had million in charge offs in  which were nominally offset by loan recoveries of million 
net loans charged off reflects the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in  compared to net charge offs of million in  and net charge offs of million in historical net loan charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge offs that may occur within these categories 

table of contents allocation of loan loss allowance december  allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate commercial and residential land and construction home equity consumer unallocated n a n a  n a  n a  n a total in conjunction with the company revised methodology in estimating losses on loans that are not impaired  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was reallocated to the respective loan categories in management believes that the revised methodology improves its ability to allocate probable credit loss to loan segments 
prior to  management considered the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses necessary because of inherent subjective risk in the loan portfolio  however  the prior methodology did not distinguish this subjective allocation by loan segment 
management considers this matter to be a reallocation in its allowance for loan losses calculation  and believes that there would be no significant change in the balance of the allowance for loan losses if this approach was used in all of the years presented above 
therefore  amounts prior to have not been reallocated 
goodwill goodwill resulted from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in june and represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill was assessed at least annually  as of november  for impairment with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined through a two step impairment test 
step includes the determination of the carrying value of the company single reporting unit  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company is required to perform a second step to the impairment test 
step requires that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
due to concerns about the company stock price  the condition of the banking industry in general  and the closing of the private placement of convertible preferred stock in june  goodwill was tested for impairment in the second quarter of  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
due to the continued depressed economic conditions and the length of time and amount by which the company book value exceeded market value per share  and the company closing of the private placement at a conversion price of per share  the company determined goodwill related to the acquisition of diablo valley bank of million was fully impaired during the second quarter of 
table of contents intangible assets intangible assets consist of core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in june these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment testing of these assets is performed at the individual asset level 
impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value at the date of the impairment test 
for intangible assets  estimates of expected future cash flows cash inflows less cash outflows that are directly associated with an intangible asset are used to determine the fair value of that asset 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the expected future cash flows from core deposit and customer relationship intangibles including account attrition  expected lives  discount rates  interest rates  servicing costs and other factors 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact the valuation of these intangible assets 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the intangible asset is adjusted to a new cost basis 
the new cost basis is then amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
based on its assessment  management concluded that there was no impairment of intangible assets at december  deposits the composition and cost of the company deposit base are important components in analyzing the company net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report 
the company liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or  in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in california  and the company market area in particular  continue to weaken 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively

liquidity and asset liability management liquidity refers to the company ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
an integral part of the company ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service area and which have  historically  been a stable source of funds 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the company interest margin 
in order to meet short term liquidity needs  the company may utilize overnight federal funds purchase arrangements and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks  solicit brokered deposits if cost effective deposits are not available from local sources and maintains collateralized lines of credit with the fhlb and frb 
in addition  the company can raise cash for temporary needs by selling securities under agreements to repurchase and selling securities available for sale

in the third quarter of  the company issued million of aggregate principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due on september  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
the subordinated debt is recorded as a component of long term debt and includes the value of the common stock issued by the trusts to the company 
the common stock is recorded as other assets for the amount issued 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital 
the subsidiary trusts are not consolidated in the company consolidated financial statements 
under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  certain trust preferred securities will no longer be eligible to be included as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
however  an exception to this statutory prohibition applies to securities issued prior to may  by bank holding companies with less than billion of total assets 
we believe  therefore  that our trust preferred securities will continue to be eligible to be treated as tier capital  subject to other rules and limitations 
in november  the company announced that it was exercising its right to defer interest payments on its outstanding trust preferred subordinated debt securities 
the company will continue to accrue the cost and recognize the expense of the interest at the normal rate on a compounded basis until such time as the deferred arrearage has been paid current 
as a result the company has accrued but has not paid approximately million in interest on its subordinated debt as of december  us treasury capital purchase program the company received million in november through the issuance of its series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of its common stock to the treasury through the us treasury capital purchase program

in november  the company announced that it was exercising its right to suspend payment of dividends on its series a preferred stock 
the company accrues the cumulative unpaid dividends at the compounded dividend rate 
as a result of the company has accrued but has not paid approximately million in dividends on its series a preferred stock as of december  private placement on june   the company issued to various institutional investors  shares of series b preferred stock and  shares of series c preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series b preferred stock was mandatorily convertible into common stock  upon approval by the shareholders at a conversion price of per share 
the series c preferred stock is mandatorily convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share upon both approval by the shareholders and thereafter  a subsequent transfer of the series c preferred stock to third parties not affiliates with the holder in a widely dispersed offering 
the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock did not include a beneficial conversion feature  as the conversion price at per share was not below the fair market value of the company common stock on the commitment date 
at the company special meeting of shareholders held on september   the company shareholders approved the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of the series b preferred stock and upon the conversion of the series c preferred stock 
as a result  on september   the series b preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock of the company and the shares of series b preferred stock ceased to be outstanding 
the series c preferred stock remains outstanding until it has been converted into common stock in accordance with its terms 
the series c preferred stock is non voting except in the case of certain transactions that would affect the rights of the holders of the series c preferred stock or applicable law 
holders of series c preferred stock will receive dividends if and only to the extent dividends are paid to

the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the 
table of contents interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down and ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or stable economic conditions unchanged from current actual levels 
the following table sets forth the estimated changes in the company net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates noted  as of december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
increase decrease in estimated net interest income amount percent dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points this data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors  which could reduce the actual impact on net interest income  if any 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on

all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company exposure to interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies general the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method  although the economics of our transactions would be the same 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses 
loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and i o strips are based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made on management expectations of future prepayment and discount rates as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under the plan 
we also granted our chief executive officer restricted stock when he joined the company 
additionally  we have outstanding options that were granted under an option plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of accounting guidance related to share based payments 
our results of operations for fiscal years   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company did not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk
