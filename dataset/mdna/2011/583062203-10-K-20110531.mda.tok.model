critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to assist users in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with asc no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically at the time of shipment  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment if these criteria are not met 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts product returns or offers markdown incentives 
material management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing sales returns and allowances estimates 
the company continuously monitors and tracks returns and allowances and records revenues net of provisions for returns and allowances 
the company s estimate of sales returns and allowances is based upon several factors including historical experience  current market and economic conditions  customer demand and acceptance of the company s products and or any notification received by the company of such a return 
historically  sales returns and allowances have been within management s estimates  however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from management s estimates depending on actual market conditions at the time of the return 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory may be written down based on such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
acquisition related intangible assets the company accounts for acquisition related intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 business combinations  and asc no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
a portion of the remaining difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net tangible assets at the date of acquisition is included in the balance sheet as acquisition related intangible assets 
amortization periods for the intangible assets subject to amortization range from seven to fifteen years depending on the nature of the assets acquired 
the carrying value of acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  is evaluated in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  which is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows based upon our estimated cost of capital  an impairment loss is reflected in loss from operations 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 

table of contents income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes  the company has determined that as of february  there was sufficient uncertainty surrounding the future realization of its deferred tax assets to warrant the recording of a full valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was recorded based upon the company s determination that there was insufficient objective evidence  at the time  to recognize those assets for financial reporting purposes 
for the fiscal year ended february   the company has not changed its assessment regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
ultimate realization of the benefit of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  including periods prior to the expiration of certain underlying tax credits 
as of february  and as of february   unrecognized tax benefits  all of which affect the effective tax rate if recognized  were million and million  respectively 
management does not anticipate that there will be a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
at february   there were no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes consists of minimum tax in various us states and income taxes on the company s operations in mexico 
this income tax expense is offset by a benefit recorded for refundable federal tax credits 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
however  the amount of a net operating loss carryforward can be adjusted for federal tax purposes for the three years four years for the major state jurisdictions in which the company operates after the net operating loss is utilized 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended february  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development loss from operations interest income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss the following table summarizes our net sales by product category year ended february  telescopes related products weather stations binoculars other net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of million or from net sales of million in fiscal the increase in sales was generally due to increased sales of the company s telescope products  as well as increases in sales of other optical products and weather stations and timing devices  offset partially by reductions in sales of accessories and sports optics products including binoculars 
sales of high end telescopes were higher primarily due to increased demand attributed to product enhancements  sales promotions and improved order fulfillment 
most of the increase in mid range products was due to increased availability of newly introduced products and reduced returns due to improvements in quality 
sales of low end telescopes were mainly higher due to increased demand attributable to the products being featured at the respective retailers for a longer period than in the prior year 
sales of other optical products were higher due to increased demand  while sales of weather stations and timing devices increased in fiscal due to the products having only been introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal the lower sales for accessory products and the company s sports optics products such as spotting scopes and binoculars were due to lower demand 
management believes that as the company introduces new and innovative products into the telescope market that demand for some of the company s products may be stimulated 
management also believes that demand for the company s less expensive telescope and binocular products can be enhanced with new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
approximately and of the company s net sales during each of the fiscal years ended february  and  respectively  were from one customer 
the gross profit margin during fiscal increased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in fiscal this improvement in the gross profit margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix  improved operating efficiency at the company s manufacturing facility in mexico higher fixed cost absorption and reduced returns and credits 
however  these improvements in gross margin were partially offset by reductions in the company s average selling price for certain of its products which was attributable to increased competition  sales promotions and inventory reduction efforts 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by higher labor costs attributable to increased production  new product enhancements  new product introductions and increased warranty claims 
gross margin was also marginally negatively affected by unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the mexican peso 
most of the company s employees at its manufacturing facility in mexico  as well as certain other manufacturing costs  are paid in mexican pesos 

table of contents selling expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal this decrease was attributable to fluctuations in product mix  reductions in headcount and reduced discretionary spending such as advertising 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million of net sales  a decrease of million or compared to million of net sales in fiscal most of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to lower stock compensation expense  reductions in headcount  reductions in professional fees and insurance premiums and reductions in certain non recurring expenses of fiscal such as the legal fees in connection with the company s reverse stock split 
research and development expenses for fiscal and were unchanged at million  due to the company s continued but measured focus on new product development and enhancement activities 
the company earned interest income in fiscal and  due to the continued cash balance the company maintains 
the reduction in interest income from thousand in fiscal to thousand in fiscal was due to changes in the administration of fees associated with the company s bank accounts 
in fiscal  reductions in fees were provided in lieu of interest income  whereas more interest income was paid and more fees were charged to the company in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at february  and  as the company was able to maintain its cash position due primarily to improved results from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million during the fiscal year ended february   a decrease of million or in net cash used by operating activities 
this improvement was attributable primarily to the reduction of approximately million in the company s net loss  however  approximately million of the reduction in the company s net loss was attributable to decreases in net non cash charges  such as depreciation and stock based compensation 
therefore  only approximately million of the reduction in the company s net loss benefited net cash provided by operations 
a net reduction of approximately million in restructuring costs paid in early fiscal  was offset by the net changes in assets and liabilities excluding restructuring costs totaling million which was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable that was attributable to the timing of shipments at the end of fiscal the company currently has in place an undrawn million secured credit facility with first capital 
availability of funds under this facility is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
availability on this facility amounted to over million as of february  while the company s credit facility does not contain explicit financial covenants  the company s lender has significant latitude in restricting  reducing or withdrawing the company s credit facility at its sole discretion with limited notice  as is customary with these types of arrangements 
in the event the company requires more capital than is presently anticipated due to unforeseen factors  the company may need to rely on its credit facility 
in such an instance  if its lender restricts  reduces or eliminates the company s access to credit  or requires immediate repayment of the amounts outstanding under the agreement  the company would be required to pursue additional or alternative sources of liquidity such as equity financings or a new debt agreement with other creditors  either of which may contain less favorable terms 
the company cannot assure that such additional sources of capital would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
the company currently anticipates that cash on hand and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements for fiscal 
table of contents capital expenditures  including financed purchases of equipment  aggregated million for each of the years ended february  and the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at february  inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past two years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal and beyond
