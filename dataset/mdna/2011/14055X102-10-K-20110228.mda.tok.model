explanation of reporting metrics interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on loans  the senior participation interest in a pool of commercial real estate loans and related assets the commercial a participation interest  investment securities  other investments  cash and cash equivalents  and collateral management fees as well as amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination and the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums  which are amortized into income using the interest method 
although the majority of our loans charge interest at variable rates that adjust periodically  we also have loans charging interest at fixed rates 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on deposits and borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discounts 
interest expense includes borrowing costs associated with credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt  subordinated debt  fhlb sf borrowings and interest paid to depositors 
our senior secured notes  convertible debt and three series of our subordinated debt bear a fixed rate of interest 
deferred financing fees  debt discounts and the costs of issuing debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the estimated life of the borrowing 
loan prepayments that trigger mandatory or optional debt repayments and repurchases may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses inherent in our portfolio 
as the size and mix of loans within these portfolios change  or if the credit quality of the portfolios change  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
operating expenses 
operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses  including deposit insurance premiums 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of loans  gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  dividends  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  other than temporary impairment on investment securities  available for sale  gains losses on derivatives  gain loss on our residential mortgage investment portfolio  due diligence deposits forfeited  unrealized appreciation depreciation of our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities  servicing income  income from our management of various loans held by third parties  gains losses on debt extinguishment at the parent company  net expense of real estate owned and other foreclosed assets  and other miscellaneous fees and expenses 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
for the tax years ended december  and  our subsidiaries were not able to participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
as a result  certain subsidiaries had taxable income that was not offset by taxable losses or loss carryforwards of other entities 
we plan to reconsolidate our subsidiaries for federal tax purposes starting in we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the change 
from through  we operated as a reit 
effective january   we revoked our reit election and recognized the deferred tax effects in our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  during the period we operated as a reit  we were generally not subject to federal income tax at the reit level on our net taxable income distributed to shareholders  but we were subject to federal corporate level tax on the net taxable income of our taxable reit subsidiaries  and we were subject to taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
in addition  we were required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet various other requirements imposed by the internal revenue code  through actual operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels  and diversity of stock ownership 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earning trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets for subsidiaries where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the incurrence of operating losses at several of our subsidiaries  and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the december  net deferred tax assets of million will be realized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal

loans accounted for on a non accrual basis are loans on which interest income is no longer recognized on an accrual basis and loans for which a specific provision is recorded for the full amount of accrued interest receivable 
we will place a loan on non accrual status if there is substantial doubt about the borrower s ability to service its debt and other obligations or if the loan is or more days past due and is not well secured and in the process of collection 
tdrs are loans that have been restructured as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial position and for which we have granted a concession to the borrower that we would not have otherwise granted if those conditions did not exist

potential problem loans are loans that are not considered non performing loans  as disclosed above  but loans where management is aware of information regarding potential credit problems of a borrower that leads to serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
such defaults could eventually result in the loans being reclassified as non performing loans 
we had million in potential problem loans as of december   primarily related to an impaired loan that was restructured during the first quarter of of our non accrual loans  million were days delinquent and million were over days delinquent as of december   and million were days delinquent and million were over days delinquent as of december  accruing loans days delinquent were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
many of our real estate construction loans include an interest reserve that is established upon origination of the loan 
we recognize interest income from the reserve during the construction period as long as the interest is deemed collectible 
as part of our ongoing credit review process  we monitor the construction of the underlying real estate to determine whether the project is progressing as originally planned 
if we determine that adverse changes have occurred such that full payment of principal and interest is no longer expected  we will place the loan on non accrual status and establish a specific reserve or charge off a portion of the principal balance  as appropriate 
we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
several examples of such requirements are the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  various real estate appraisal and other third party reports standards  and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered  including the use of interest reserves 
for additional information  see credit risk management within this section 
we maintain servicing procedures for real estate construction loans  the objective of which is to maintain the proper relationship between the loan amount funded and the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the principal servicing tasks include  but are not limited to monitoring construction of the project to evaluate the work in place  quality of construction compliance with plans and specifications and adequacy of the budget to complete the project 
we generally use a third party consultant for this evaluation  but also maintain frequent contact with the borrower to obtain updates on the project 
monitoring compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement  which contains important construction and leasing provisions 
reviewing and approving advance requests per the loan agreement which establishes the frequency  conditions and process for making advances 
typically  each loan advance is conditioned upon funding only for work in place  certification by the construction consultant  and sufficient funds remaining in the loan budget to complete the project 
additionally  our risk rating policies require that the assignment of a risk rating should consider whether the capitalization of interest may be masking other performance related issues 
the adequacy of the interest reserve generally is evaluated each time a risk rating conclusion is required or rendered with particular attention paid to the underlying value of the collateral and its ongoing support of the transaction 
obtaining updated third party valuations is considered when significant negative variances to expected performance exist 
generally  our policy on updating appraisals is to obtain current appraisals subsequent to the impairment date if there are significant changes to the underlying assumptions from the most recent appraisal 
some factors that could cause significant changes include the passage of more than twelve months since the time of the last appraisal  the volatility of the local market  the availability of financing  the inventory of competing properties  new improvements to  or lack of maintenance of  the subject property or competing surrounding properties  a change in zoning  environmental contamination  or failure of the project to meet material assumptions of the original appraisal 
we generally consider appraisals to be current if they are dated within the past twelve months 
however  we may obtain an updated appraisal on a more frequent basis if in our determination there are significant changes to the underlying assumptions from the most recent appraisal 
as of december   million of our collateral dependent loans had an appraisal older than twelve months 
the fair value of the collateral for these loans was determined through inputs outside of appraisals  including actual and comparable sales transactions  broker price opinions and other relevant data 
of these loans  million related to a shared national credit reviewed by federal examiners during six of the loans that comprise our real estate construction portfolio as of december  have been extended  renewed or restructured since origination 
these modifications have occurred for various reasons including  but not limited to  changes in business plans  work out efforts that were best achieved via a restructuring or discounted pay off 
in considering the performing status of a real estate construction loan  the current payment of interest  whether in cash or through an interest reserve  is only one of the factors used in our analysis 
our impairment analysis generally considers the loan s maturity  the likelihood of a restructuring of the loan and if that restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  whether the borrower is current on interest and principal payments  the condition of underlying assets and the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at market terms 
although an interest reserve may mitigate a delinquency that could cause impairment  other issues with the loan or borrower may lead to an impairment determination 
impairment is then measured based on a fair market or discounted cash flow value to assess the current value of the loan relative to the principal balance 
if the valuation analysis indicates that repayment in full is doubtful  the loan will be placed on non accrual status and designated as non performing

the decrease in the non performing loan balance from december  to december  is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the a trust 
non performing loans related to the a trust as of december  were million  including million of non accrual loans  million of accruing loans contractually past due days or more  and million of tdrs 
the remaining million decrease in the non performing loan balance was primarily due to pay offs  charge offs  and foreclosures on those loans  and a decrease in the number of loans that became non performing during the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december     and was as follows year ended december  in thousands balance as of beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate real estate construction total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate real estate construction total recoveries net charge offs charge offs upon transfer to held for sale deconsolidation of a trust provision for loan losses balance as of end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding the allowance for loan losses allocated to each category of loans and the percentage of each category to our total loan portfolio as of december     and was as follows december  in thousands allocation by category commercial real estate real estate construction total loan loss allowance percentage of total loan portfolio by category commercial real estate real estate construction total our allowance for loan losses decreased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease comprised a million decrease in general reserves and a million decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans as further described below 
the decrease in the general reserves was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans due to loan payoffs  principal payments  loan sales  loans newly classified as impaired  and lower expected losses in the portfolio due to a shift in loan mix and the deconsolidation of the a trust  which resulted in the removal of million of general reserves related to the loans held for investment which were derecognized from our balance sheet during the period 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans had decreased to billion and the general reserves allocated to that portfolio had decreased to million  representing an effective reserve percentage of 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans was billion and the general reserves allocated to that portfolio were million  representing an effective reserve percentage of 
the lower effective reserve percentage reflects the lower historical losses generally experienced by the non impaired loans remaining in our portfolio as of december  as a result of the shift in loan mix 
our loans in categories with the greatest historical loss experience continue to pay off 
additionally  the majority of our new originations are in those categories with lower historical loss experience 
the decrease in the specific reserves was primarily related to million of charge offs taken on impaired loans and the removal of million in specific reserves due to the deconsolidation of the a trust as described above 
these decreases were partially offset by the addition of million of specific reserves on impaired loans outstanding as of december  the carrying values of our impaired loans reflect incurred losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio 
we employ a formal quarterly process to both identify impaired loans and record appropriate specific reserves based on available collateral and other borrower specific information

due to the large individual credit exposures and characteristics of real estate and real estate construction loans  the level of charge offs in this area has been volatile 
given our loss experience  we consider our higher risk loans within the commercial real estate portfolio to be loans secured by collateral that have not reached stabilization 
as of december  and  commercial real estate loans that have not reached stabilization had an outstanding principal balance of million and million  respectively 
this amount was net of cumulative charge offs taken on these loans of million and million  respectively 
no specific reserves were allocated to these loans as of december  there was million of specific reserves allocated to these loans as of december  during the year ended december   capitalsource bank restructured three commercial real estate loans into new loans using an a note b note structure where the b note component has been fully charged off 
the contractual principal balances of these three loans prior to the restructurings totaled million 
in connection with the restructurings  million of debt was forgiven and charged off  and million was collected as principal payments  leaving million of a notes and million of b notes 
as of december   the carrying value of the a notes was million  and the b notes had no carrying value 
the workout strategy discussed above results in the a note equaling a balance the borrower can service and is underwritten to a loan to value ratio based on the current collateral valuation 
the a note may be upgraded based on the revised terms and management s assessment of the borrower s ability and intent to repay 
the a note is structured at a market interest rate  and the a note debt service is typically covered by the in place property operations allowing it to be placed on accrual status 
the reduced loan amount induces the borrower to continue to support the loan and maintain the collateral despite the observed reduction in the collateral value 
the b note usually bears no interest or an interest rate significantly below the market rate 
the a note contains amortization provisions  and the b note requires amortization only after the full repayment of the a note 
accrual status for each loan  including restructured a notes  is considered on a loan by loan basis 
the newly established principal balance of the a note is set at a level where the borrower is expected to keep the loan current and where the underlying collateral value adequately supports the loan 
the revised structure is intended to allow the a loan to be placed on accrual status 
all loans that have undergone this a note b note restructuring are considered tdrs 
the a notes are deemed impaired and remain so classified for at least one year from the date of the restructuring 
after one year  the a notes are evaluated quarterly to determine if the loan performance has complied with the terms of the tdr such that the impairment classification may be removed

the specific reserves allocated to loans that were involved in tdrs were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses and charge offs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily driven by a decrease in charge offs related to impaired commercial and real estate construction loans 
our loans in categories with the greatest historical loss experience continue to pay off 
additionally  the majority of our new originations are in categories with lower historical loss experience 
the increase in provision for loan losses and charge offs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was driven largely from charge offs in our real estate portfolio which includes land  second lien real estate and mortgage rediscount loans 
due to the large individual credit exposures and characteristics of real estate loans  the level of charge offs in this area has been volatile in the past

as of december   we had billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit  of which million were commitments of capitalsource bank and million were commitments of the parent company 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites or discretion to future fundings by us  and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
although we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to exceed the parent company s available funds  we forecast adequate liquidity to fund the expected borrower draws under these commitments 
to the extent there are unfunded commitments with respect to a loan that is owned partially by capitalsource bank and the parent company  unless our client is in default  capitalsource bank is obligated in some cases  pursuant to intercompany agreements  to fund its portion of the unfunded commitment before the parent company is required to fund its portion 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
unless otherwise specified  the figures presented in the following paragraphs are based on current forecasts and take into account activity since december  the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with  and is subject to and qualified by the information set forth under item a  risk factors  and the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
capitalsource bank liquidity the most significant variable in capitalsource bank s liquidity management is our expectation regarding the net growth in the loan and deposit portfolios 
capitalsource bank s primary sources of liquidity include deposits  payments of principal and interest on loans and securities  cash equivalents  and borrowings from the fhlb sf 
secondary sources of liquidity may also include capital contributions and borrowings from the parent company  bank borrowings  and the issuance of debt securities 
we intend to maintain sufficient liquidity at capitalsource bank to meet depositor demands and fund loan commitments and operations as well as to maintain liquidity ratios required by our regulators 
capitalsource bank s primary uses of liquidity include funding new and existing loans  purchasing investment securities  funding net deposit outflows  and paying operating expenses  including intercompany payments to the parent company for origination and other services performed on capitalsource bank s behalf 
capitalsource bank operates in accordance with the conditions imposed in connection with regulatory approvals obtained upon its formation  including requirements applicable until july that capitalsource bank maintain a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  capital levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under relevant banking regulations  and a ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets of not less than 
in addition  we have a policy to maintain of capitalsource bank s assets in unencumbered cash  cash equivalents and investments 
in accordance with regulatory guidance  we have identified  modeled and planned for the financial  capital and liquidity impact of various events and scenarios that would cause a large outflow of deposits  a reduction in borrowing capacity  a material increase in loan funding obligations  a material increase in credit costs or any combination of these events 
we anticipate that capitalsource bank would be able to maintain sufficient liquidity and ratios in excess of its required minimum ratios in these events and scenarios 
capitalsource bank s primary source of liquidity is deposits  most of which are in the form of certificates of deposit 
as of december   deposits at capitalsource bank were billion 
we utilize various product  pricing  and promotional strategies in our deposit business  so that we are able to obtain and maintain sufficient deposits to meet our liquidity needs 
for additional information  see note  deposits  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  capitalsource bank supplements its deposit funding with borrowings from the fhlb sf 
as a member of the fhlb sf  capitalsource bank had financing availability with the fhlb sf as of december  equal to of capitalsource bank s total assets 
the maximum financing available under this formula was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the financing is subject to various terms and conditions including pledging acceptable collateral  satisfaction of the fhlb sf stock ownership requirement and certain limits regarding the maximum term of debt 
as of december   collateral with an estimated fair value of million was pledged to the fhlb sf 
as of december  and  capitalsource bank had borrowing capacity with the fhlb sf based on pledged collateral as follows december  in thousands borrowing capacity less outstanding principal less outstanding letters of credit unused borrowing capacity capitalsource bank participates in the primary credit program of the frb of san francisco s discount window under which approved depository institutions are eligible to borrow from the frb for periods of up to days 
as of december   collateral with an estimated fair value of million had been pledged under this program  and there were no borrowings outstanding under this program 
capitalsource bank also maintains a portfolio of investment securities 
as of december   capitalsource bank had million of cash and cash equivalents and billion in investment securities  available for sale 
the investment portfolio comprises primarily highly liquid securities that can be sold and converted to cash if additional liquidity needs arise 
parent company liquidity the parent company s need for liquidity is based on our expectation that the balance of our existing loan portfolio and other assets held in the parent company will run off over time 
the parent company s primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  principal and interest payments  asset sales  and servicing fees from securitizations 
a portion of the proceeds from some of these sources is required to be used to make mandatory repayments on our indebtedness 
the parent company also has access to secondary sources of liquidity including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt securities  subject to restrictions under existing indebtedness  and the issuance of additional shares of equity 
capitalsource bank is prohibited from paying dividends until july without consent from our regulators 
we do not anticipate that dividends from capitalsource bank will provide any liquidity to fund the operations of the parent company for the near term future 
the parent company s primary uses of liquidity include interest and principal payments on our existing debt  operating expenses  share repurchases  any dividends that we may pay  and the funding of unfunded commitments 
the parent company is required to redeem its and convertible debentures at the option of the noteholders on july  as of december   outstanding balances on the and convertible debentures were million and million  respectively 
we currently intend to repurchase these convertible debentures with cash at or prior to july  pursuant to agreements with our regulators  to the extent capitalsource bank independently is unable to do so  the parent company must maintain capitalsource bank s total risk based capital ratio at not less than and must maintain the capital levels of capitalsource bank at all times to meet the levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under the relevant banking regulations 
additionally  pursuant to requirements of our regulators  the parent company has provided a million unsecured revolving credit facility to capitalsource bank that capitalsource bank may draw on at any time it or the fdic deems necessary 
as of december   this facility was undrawn 
the parent company is subject to financial and non financial covenants under our indebtedness  including  with respect to restricted payments  leverage  servicing standards  and limitations on incurring or guaranteeing indebtedness  refinancing existing indebtedness  repaying subordinated indebtedness  making investments  dividends  distributions  redemptions or repurchases of our capital stock  selling assets  creating liens and engaging in a merger  sale or consolidation 
if we were to default under our indebtedness by violating these covenants or otherwise  our investors remedies would include the ability to  among other things  transfer servicing to another servicer  foreclose on collateral  and or accelerate payment of all amounts payable under such indebtedness 
in addition  upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults  the holders of the asset backed notes issued in our term debt may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans and appoint a successor servicer or replace us as cash manager 
if we were terminated as servicer  we would no longer receive our servicing fee 
in addition  because there can be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards  the performance of our loans could be materially adversely affected and income generated from those loans significantly reduced 
in february  to avoid potential events of default  we amended the covenant for the minimum tangible net worth in our syndicated bank credit facility and our cs funding iii  cs funding vii and cs europe credit facilities to require that our tangible net worth be no less than billion  plus of net proceeds from the issuance of capital stock and or conversion of debt after the amendment date 
in addition  we modified the maturity date on our syndicated bank credit facility from march  to december  and agreed to reduce the aggregate commitment amount on the facility to million as of april   to million by january  and thereafter by an additional million per month  unless otherwise reduced by the receipt of collateral proceeds 
in may  we modified the maturity date on our cs europe credit facility from may  to may  in december  we completed a consent solicitation regarding our notes and entered into a supplemental indenture which permits us to use available cash to purchase our convertible debentures redeemable in july and july  modified the formula for calculating our restricted payment capacity  permits us to contribute the equity in our remaining four securitizations to capitalsource bank  and allows us to obtain secured debt with a minimum advance rate of  rather than the previous requirement  in each case  subject to our satisfying certain collateral coverage tests 
as of december   the parent company had four secured credit facilities with aggregate commitments of million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
during the first quarter of  we terminated all of the credit facilities with the exception of our syndicated bank facility  which had an aggregate commitment of million and no outstanding balance as of december  we terminated our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan effective march  in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our common stock over a period of up to two years 
in december  we repurchased  shares of our stock in open market transactions for a total purchase price of million 
all shares repurchased under this plan were retired upon settlement 
for additional information  see note  shareholders equity  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  special purpose entities we use special purpose entities spes as part of our funding activities  and we service loans that we have transferred to these entities 
the use of these special purpose entities is generally required in connection with our non recourse secured term debt financings to legally isolate from us loans that we transfer to these entities if we were to enter into a bankruptcy proceeding 
we evaluate all spes with which we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities  we consolidate these entities if we also determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities for which we determine we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments 
the assets and related liabilities of all special purpose entities that we use to issue our term debt are recognized in our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and commitments  guarantees contingencies as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was to related parties 
for additional information  see note  related party transactions  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
additional information on these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in our form k  and liquidity and capital resources herein 
we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment  which expire over the next fourteen years and contain provisions for certain annual rental escalations 
the lease for our chevy chase  maryland space requires estimated minimum payments of million per annum 
we provide standby letters of credit in conjunction with several of our lending arrangements 
as of december  and  we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next five years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
these arrangements had carrying amounts totaling million and million  as reported in other liabilities in our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
we also provide standby letters of credit under certain of our property leases 
in connection with certain securitization transactions  we have made customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets and collateral 
prior to any securitization transaction  we generally performed due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction and the collateral to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization or financing vehicle 
during  we sold all of our remaining direct real estate investment properties 
we are responsible for indemnifying the current owners for any remediation  including costs of removal and disposal of asbestos that existed prior to the sales  through the third anniversary date of the sale 
we will recognize any remediation costs if notified by the current owners of their intention to exercise their indemnification rights  however  no such notification has been received to date 
as of december   sufficient information was not available to estimate our potential liability for conditional asset retirement obligations as the obligations to remove the asbestos from these properties continue to have indeterminable settlement dates 
from time to time we are party to legal proceedings 
we do not believe that any currently pending or threatened proceeding  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  including our cash flows 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases and we have committed to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  and million to an equity investment 
the contractual obligations under our debt are included in our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  the expected contractual obligations under our certificates of deposit  debt  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december   were as follows certificates of credit term convertible subordinated notes deposit facilities debt debt debt payable other total in thousands thereafter total the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities including amortization periods but not considering optional annual renewals and assume utilization of available term out features 
during the first quarter of  we terminated all of the credit facilities with the exception of our syndicated bank facility  which had a zero balance as of december  the amounts are presented gross of net unamortized discounts of million on our term debt securitizations and million on the senior secured notes 
contractual obligations on our term debt securitizations are computed based on their estimated lives 
the estimated lives are based upon the contractual amortization schedule of the underlying loans 
these underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which could shorten the life of the term debt securitizations  conversely  the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which may lengthen the life of the term debt securitizations 
at our option  we may substitute loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt securitizations 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date and are presented gross of net unamortized discount of million 
the legal maturities of the convertible debt are and for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities  which are between and includes operating leases and non cancelable contracts 
we enter into derivative contracts under which we either receive cash or are required to pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our loan and derivative portfolios 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on management s assessment of the client and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
as appropriate  the parent company and capitalsource bank credit committees evaluate and approve credit standards and oversee the credit risk management function related to our loans and other investments 
their primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring economic and market conditions having an impact on our credit related activities  and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk and monitoring our client s financial condition and performance 
substantially all new loans have been originated at capitalsource bank since its formation  and we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual for those loans that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
examples of such requirements include the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  standards for real estate appraisals and other third party reports  and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered 
loan types defined within these guidelines have three broad categories  within our commercial  real estate  and real estate construction loan portfolios 
these categories include asset based loans  cash flow loans  and real estate loans  and each of these broad categories has specific subsections that define in detail the following loan structures  which includes the lien positions  amortization provisions and loan tenors  collateral descriptions and appropriate valuation methods  underwriting considerations which include minimum diligence and verification requirements  and specific risk acceptance criteria which enumerate for each loan type the minimum acceptable credit performance standards 
examples of these criteria include maximum loan to value amounts for real estate loans  maximum advance rate amounts for asset based loans and minimum historical and projected debt service coverage amounts for all loans we measure and document each loan s compliance with our specific risk acceptance criteria at underwriting 
if at underwriting  there is an exception to these criteria  an explanation of the factors that mitigate this additional risk generally is considered before an approval is granted 
credit risk management for our loan portfolios begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same two factors collateral and financial performance 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  industry and single name concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a client s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we syndicate loan exposure to other lenders  sell loans and use other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in lending activities with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration was healthcare and social assistance  which made up approximately of our loan portfolio 
as of december   taken in the aggregate  non healthcare real estate loans made up approximately of our loan portfolio 
as of december   the two largest geographical concentrations were florida and california  which each making up approximately of our loan portfolio 
as of december   million  or  of our portfolio consisted of loans to four clients with aggregate loan balances that are individually greater than million 
of this amount  loans to one real estate client totaling million were on non accrual 
the remaining loans were performing 
selected information pertaining to our five largest credit relationships as of december  was as follows amount of allowance date of last amount loan of total loan s loan for loan underlying collateral of last balance portfolio loan type industry at origination commitment performing losses collateral appraisal appraisal in thousands  commercial and real estate health care and social assistance   yes stock pledge n a n a  commercial and real estate construction accommodation and food services and finance and insurance   partial timeshare receivables n a n a  real estate accommodation and food services   yes portfolio of vacation properties december november   real estate construction accommodation and food services   no hotel june  commercial and real estate health care and social assistance   yes nursing care facilities january  represents the primary collateral securing the loan 
in certain cases  there may be additional types of collateral 
the primary collateral that secures our loan balance of million as of december  is a stock pledge of the parent company that owns nursing care facilities valued at billion based on appraisals dated may and june total senior debt secured by the nursing care facilities was billion as of september  of our total loan balance  million was senior debt 
this credit relationship includes multiple loans  one of which  with a balance of million  is non performing 
the collateral that secures our loan balance of million primarily comprises timeshare receivables and timeshare real estate and had a total value of million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  secured by the collateral was million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  was million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  was million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  was million as of december  the nursing care facilities real estate secures million of our loan balance as of december  the remainder of the loan balance of million as of december  is secured by accounts receivable 
problem loans in our portfolio of loans held for investment may include non accrual loans  accruing loans contractually past due  or tdrs 
our remediation efforts on problem loans are based upon the characteristics of each specific situation 
the various remediation efforts that we may undertake include  among other things  one of or a combination of the following request that the equity owners of the borrower inject additional capital  require the borrower to provide us with additional collateral  request additional guaranties or letters of credit  request the borrower to improve cash flow by taking actions such as selling non strategic assets or reducing operating expenses  modify the terms of our debt  including the deferral of principal or interest payments  where we will appropriately classify the modification as a tdr  initiate foreclosure proceedings on the collateral  or sell the loan in certain cases where there is an interested third party buyer 
there were credit relationships in the non performing portfolio as of december   and our largest non performing credit relationship totaled million and comprised of our total non performing loans 
this credit relationship comprises real estate construction loans to a borrower in the accommodation and food services industry 
the primary collateral supporting these loans is a hotel 
these loans were originated in june the outstanding loan balances as of december  for this relationship are inclusive of charge offs taken to reduce the outstanding loan balances to the estimated fair value of the collateral based upon an appraisal received in tdrs are loans that have been restructured as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial position and for which we have granted a concession to the borrower that we would not have otherwise granted if those conditions did not exist 
our concession strategies in tdrs are intended to minimize our economic losses as borrowers experience financial difficulty and provide an alternative to foreclosure 
the success of these strategies is highly dependent on our borrowers ability and willingness to repay under the restructured terms of their loans 
continued adverse changes in the economic environment or in borrower performance could negatively impact the outcome of these strategies 
a summary of concessions granted by loan type  including the accrual status of the loans as of december  and is as follows december  non accrual accrual total non accrual accrual total in thousands commercial interest rate and fee reduction maturity extension payment deferral multiple concessions real estate interest rate and fee reduction maturity extension multiple concessions real estate construction maturity extension multiple concessions total we have experienced losses incurred on some tdrs subsequent to their initial restructuring 
these losses include both additional specific reserves and charge offs on the restructured loans 
the majority of such losses has been incurred on our commercial loans and is primarily due to the borrowers failure to consistently meet their financial forecasts that formed the bases for our restructured loans 
examples of circumstances that resulted in the borrowers not being able to meet their forecasts included acquisitions of other businesses that did not have the expected positive impact on financial results  significant delays in launching products and services  and continued deterioration in the pricing estimates of businesses and product lines that the borrower expected to sell to generate proceeds to repay the loan 
in certain of these cases  the tdrs occurred prior to  and the borrowers performed under the terms of the restructured loans for a period of time before their operations were negatively impacted by recent market conditions 
losses incurred on tdrs since their initial restructuring by concession and loan type for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands commercial interest rate and fee reduction maturity extension payment deferral multiple concessions real estate maturity extension interest rate and fee reduction real estate construction maturity extension multiple concessions total of the additional losses recognized on commercial loan tdrs since their initial restructuring for the year ended december   related to loans for which the initial tdr on the borrower occurred prior to  related to loans that had additional modifications subsequent to their initial tdrs  and all related to loans that were on non accrual status as of december  we recognized approximately million of interest income for the year ended december  on the commercial loans that experienced losses during this period 
of the additional losses recognized on commercial loan tdrs since their initial restructuring for year ended december   related to loans for which the initial tdr on the borrower occurred prior to  related to loans that had additional modifications subsequent to their initial tdrs  and all of the additional losses related to loans that were on non accrual status as of december  we recognized approximately million of interest income for the year ended december  on the commercial loans that experienced losses during this period 
of the additional losses recognized on commercial loan tdrs since their initial restructuring for year ended december   related to loans that had additional modifications subsequent to their initial tdrs  and all of the additional losses related to loans that were on non accrual status as of december  we recognized approximately million of interest income for the year ended december  on the commercial loans that experienced losses during this period 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from all counterparties based on terms stipulated in the collateral support annex 
we also monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily on a per counterparty basis 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their derivative positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments was million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we held million and million of collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  and  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities  which result in the recognition of assets and liabilities in our audited consolidated financial statements  including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk in our normal course of business refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the libor rate or a prime based rate with most of the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
approximately half of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or cp  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
our deposits are fixed rate  but at short terms 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimated changes in net interest income for a twelve month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to the combined portfolios of our segments as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points for the purpose of the above analysis  we included loans  investment securities  borrowings  deposits and derivatives 
in addition  we assumed that the size of the current portfolio remains the same as the existing portfolio as of december  loans  investment securities and deposits are assumed to be replaced as they run off 
the new loans  investment securities and deposits are assumed to have interest rates that reflect our forecast of prevailing market terms 
we also assumed that libor does not fall below for loans and borrowings  and that the prime rate does not fall below for loans 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our loans had interest rate floors and were accruing interest as of december  of the loans with interest rate floors  approximately had contractual rates below the interest rate floor and the floor was providing a benefit to us 
the loans with contractual interest rate floors as of december   were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates below the interest rate floor exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor loans with interest rate floors on non accrual loans with no interest rate floor total as of december   the outstanding unpaid principal balance of loans subject to interest rate floors by adjustable rate index and by the spread between the floor rate and the fully indexed rate were as follows basis points above floor total in thousands month libor month libor month libor month libor prime other total adjustable rate loans non accrual loans subject to interest rate floors total loans subject to interest rate floors loans not subject to interest rate floors total loans we enter into interest rate swap agreements to minimize the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations specific to our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate loans 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these basis swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to one month libor 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate debt to one month libor 
we have also entered into relatively short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency denominated loans 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  goodwill impairment goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if events or circumstances  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the annual test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is calculated and compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net loss income 
as of december   our annual test for goodwill impairment on capitalsource bank  which represents the reporting unit level at which goodwill is currently recorded  was performed by an independent third party valuation specialist 
the valuation specialist employed various approaches to compute values of capitalsource bank  including valuation of comparable public companies  discounted cash flow analysis  recent merger and acquisition precedent transactions  and regression analysis based on return on tangible equity to price tangible book value 
critical assumptions that were used as part of these approaches include the selection of a comparable set of public companies  the selection of market comparable merger and acquisition transactions  the discount rate applied to future earnings  and the potential future earnings of capitalsource bank 
the range of values computed in this valuation assessment exceeded capitalsource bank s carrying value by to and  accordingly  we concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of december  the comparable public companies approach yielded the lowest value in the range of values computed for capitalsource bank by the valuation specialist 
for this approach  the valuation specialist calculated an implied equity valuation based on price to tangible book value using sixteen comparable banks with similar characteristics to capitalsource bank 
selection of comparable banks was based on bank size and loan portfolio mix 
to consider the degree of uncertainty in this approach  the valuation specialist applied to the price to tangible book value multiple assumption to generate a range of values 
the valuation of capitalsource bank may be negatively impacted by operating losses or a downturn in the economy causing banks to trade at reduced multiples of price to tangible book value 
we will continue to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have established detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the assumptions and judgments surrounding these areas are adequately controlled  independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
management performs detailed reviews of the portfolio quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan losses 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the loan portfolio includes balances with non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually  and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
loans are then segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
higher risk loans are individually analyzed for impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for loans determined to be individually impaired 
all impaired loans are valued to determine if a specific allowance is warranted 
the valuation analysis for the specific allowance is based upon one of the three valuation methods i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s initially contracted effective yield  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral 
the appropriate valuation methodology generally reflects the chosen loan resolution strategy being pursued to maximize the loan recovery 
estimated costs to sell are considered in the impairment valuation when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan 
any guarantees provided by the borrower are typically not considered when determining our potential for specific loss 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation of inherent losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends and any other pertinent information within specific portfolio segments 
as set forth in detail below  the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and  therefore  net income 
within this process  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  and iv adjustments made to assess certain factors  including overall credit and economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we assign reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation are determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  land  commercial real estate  healthcare receivables or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  borrower industry  the relative seniority of our security interest  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
we update these reserve factors periodically to capture actual and recent behavioral characteristics of the portfolios 
we estimate the allowance by applying historical loss factors derived from loss tracking mechanisms associated with actual portfolio activity over a specified period of time 
these estimates are adjusted when necessary based on additional analysis of long term average loss experience  external loan loss data and other risks identified from current and expected credit market conditions and trends  including management s judgment for estimated inaccuracy and uncertainty 
we also consider the need for qualitative factors which we use to provide for uncertainties surrounding our estimation process including changes in the volume of our problem loans  changes in the value of collateral for our collateral dependent loans  and the existence of certain loan concentrations 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of percentage applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows estimated increase decrease in the change in reserve factors allowance for loan losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
the process of determining the level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
we also consider whether losses might be incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions

fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in accordance with gaap  we prioritize the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy  consisting of three levels of inputs  prioritizes observable data from active markets and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities that are actively traded in the marketplace or that have values based on readily available market value data require little  if any  subjectivity to be applied when determining the fair value 
these are classified as either level or level whether an asset or liability is classified as level or level depends largely on its similarity with other items in the marketplace and our ability to obtain corroborative data regarding whether the market in which the instrument trades is active 
fair value measurements on assets and liabilities that are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall measurement are classified as level as of december   and of total assets and total liabilities  respectively  were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
of these assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis  million of total assets were classified as level  billion of total assets were classified as level and million of total assets were classified as level as of december  from a liability perspective  million of total liabilities were classified as level as of december  as of december   no liabilities were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable market based inputs  when appropriate  to value our assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis or to determine whether an adjustment to fair value is needed for assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a non recurring basis 
given the nature of some of our assets carried at fair value  whether on a recurring or nonrecurring basis  clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available 
therefore  the fair value measurements of these instruments utilize unobservable inputs and are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
we may be required to apply significant judgments in determining our fair value estimates for these assets 
due to the unavailability of observable inputs for our level assets  management assumptions used in the valuation models play a significant role in these fair value estimates 
in times of severe market volatility and illiquidity  there may be more uncertainty and variability with lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
an illiquid market is one in which little or no observable activity has occurred or one that lacks willing buyers 
to factor in market illiquidity  management makes adjustments to certain inputs in the valuation models and makes other assumptions to ensure fair values are reasonable and reflect current market conditions 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measurement 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  management s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
for additional information  see note  fair value measurements  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimates of fair values reflect our best judgments regarding the appropriate valuation methods and assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
due to the lack of observability of significant inputs  we must make assumptions in deriving our valuation inputs based on relevant empirical data surrounding interest rates  asset prices  timing of future cash flows and credit performance 
in addition  assumptions must be made to reflect constraints on liquidity  counterparty credit quality and other unobservable factors 
imprecision surrounding our assumptions related to unobservable market inputs may impact the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
furthermore  use of different methods to derive the fair value of our assets and liabilities could result in different fair value estimates at the measurement date 
we record  on a recurring basis  fair value adjustments on our loans held for investment when we have determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against the loans 
to measure the required specific reserve for loans that are collateral dependent  we utilize the fair value of collateral  less costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to our loans held for investment measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these losses were attributable to an increased number of loans requiring a specific reserve during the year  as well as declines in the fair value of collateral for these loans 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when  in the future  certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
for the tax years ended december  and  our subsidiaries were not able to participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
as a result  certain subsidiaries had taxable income that was not offset by taxable losses or loss carryforwards of other entities 
we plan to reconsolidate our subsidiaries for federal tax purposes starting in we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the change 
from through  we operated as a real estate investment trust reit 
effective january   we revoked our reit election and recognized the deferred tax effects in our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  during the period we operated as a reit  we were generally not subject to federal income tax at the reit level on our net taxable income distributed to shareholders  but we were subject to federal corporate level tax on the net taxable income of our taxable reit subsidiaries  and we were subject to taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
in addition  we were required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet various other requirements imposed by the internal revenue code the code  through actual operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels  and diversity of stock ownership 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets for subsidiaries where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the incurrence of operating losses at several of our subsidiaries  and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the december  net deferred tax assets of million will be realized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 
we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes that can be utilized to offset future taxable income 
if we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than of our capital stock over a three year period as measured under section of the internal revenue code the code  our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  certain built in losses and other tax attributes recognized in years after the ownership change generally would be limited 
the annual limit would equal the product of a the applicable long term tax exempt rate and b the value of the relevant taxable entity s capital stock immediately before the ownership change 
these change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of a company s outstanding stock  including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under section of the code  and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions 
the determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control 
no assurance can be given as to whether we have undergone  or in the future will undergo  an ownership change under section of the code 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million of income tax benefit and million of income tax expense  respectively  with respect to our income from continuing operations 
the effective income tax rate for these periods was and  respectively 
we file income tax returns with the united states and various state  local and foreign jurisdictions and generally remain subject to examinations by these tax jurisdictions for tax years through in  we settled an internal revenue service examination for the tax years and and in and  we settled certain state examinations for the tax years  and in connection with the settlement and conclusion of these examinations  we incurred penalty and interest expense of million in and paid taxes in the amount of million and million in and  respectively 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service and certain states for the tax years to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  which are discussed in detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the market risk management section 
in addition  for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in an accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  management report on internal controls over financial reporting the management of capitalsource inc capitalsource is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
capitalsource s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to capitalsource s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
capitalsource s management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on such assessment management believes that  as of december   the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
capitalsource s independent registered public accounting firm  ernst young llp  has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
this report appears on page report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and shareholders of capitalsource inc we have audited capitalsource inc s capitalsource internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 
capitalsource s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal controls over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  capitalsource inc maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso criteria 
we also have audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of capitalsource inc as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  and our report dated february  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon
