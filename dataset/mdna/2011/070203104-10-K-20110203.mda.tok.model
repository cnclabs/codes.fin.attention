item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bassett furniture industries  incorporated together with its consolidated subsidiaries  bassett  we  our or the company  based in bassett  va  is a leading retailer  manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings 
our products are sold primarily through a network of licensee and company owned branded stores under the bassett home furnishings bhf or store or bassett furniture direct bfd or store name  with additional distribution through other multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers 
bassettbaby cribs and casegoods as well as certain upholstery products are sold through specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy 
our store program was created in as a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  well made furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
this service includes complimentary room planning  in home design visits  fast delivery  and custom order furniture 
this strategy both builds on our strengths brand name  balance sheet and product offerings and better positions us to capitalize on the changing furniture retail environment 
our store network included licensee owned stores and company owned and operated stores at november  during  we acquired a total of eleven licensee stores in maryland  missouri  illinois  new york  alabama  mississippi  california  delaware  and north carolina 
we also opened two additional stores in the second quarter of  one new store in virginia and re opened a store in new jersey that was closed in by a former licensee 
we closed our mt 
pleasant  south carolina store in march as the result of an eminent domain condemnation for which we have received full settlement from the state 
in addition  two licensee stores closed during the third quarter of we do not have any real estate investments  lease obligations  or lease guarantee exposures with respect to these two stores 
also  in the fourth quarter of  we closed our store in fairview heights  missouri 
as we had previously recorded sufficient reserves with respect to our lease obligations at that location  we did not incur any additional significant charges as a result of this closure 
other store closures are possible during that could result in lease exit charges or increases in our lease and loan guarantee reserves 
the following table summarizes the changes in store count during fiscal november  new stores stores acquired stores closed november  licensee owned stores company owned stores total our wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in newton  north carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture 
we believe that we are an industry leader with our quick ship custom upholstery offerings 
we also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in martinsville  va 
most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants  primarily in china and vietnam 
we define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally 
for fiscal  approximately of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to for fiscal overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult over the past several years although we have seen some slight improvement during nevertheless  we have continued to face significant economic pressures as new housing starts remain down and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by continuing high unemployment 
these conditions have significantly 
table of contents limited the resumption of growth for big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
consequently  this has put pressure on certain of our dealers ability to generate adequate profits to fully pay us for the furniture we have sold to them 
as a result  we incurred significantly increased bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during fiscal  and of   and  respectively 
although management will continue to work closely with our licensees to ensure the success of both the licensee and bassett  further store closures are possible during and beyond that could result in lease exit charges or increases in our lease and loan guarantee reserves 
we also may increase the number of company owned stores during  primarily through acquisitions of certain licensee owned stores as well as a limited number of new store openings in selected markets 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet is a stated management goal and is vital to our retail strategy 
the store program entails key business risks  including the realization of receivables and the coverage of both direct and contingent liabilities primarily associated with retail real estate 
we have established decision criteria and business disciplines aimed at minimizing potential losses from these risks 
given the difficult and somewhat unprecedented environment  we have taken several important actions which have improved our results and liquidity 
these include aggressively working with certain licensees to take over or close those stores that are underperforming  resulting in reduced exposure in our accounts receivable 
optimizing our inventory levels to improve working capital and cash flow while striving to attain satisfactory service levels to our retail distribution channels  including both company owned stores and licensees 
inventory reductions added significantly to operating cash flow through the second quarter of we increased our investment in inventory during the third quarter of by million in order to improve service levels 
inventory levels remained stable during the fourth quarter of right sizing our expense structure in our corporate retail segment  resulting in a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales after excluding the effect of newly added retail stores 
implementing cost containment measures in our wholesale segment which have reduced fixed overhead and sg a expenses to improve our operating margins 
suspending our quarterly dividend 
delaying certain capital expenditures 
we will also continue to work diligently with our network of licensees to improve their operating results 
with the existing and planned improvements in our retail program and our strong balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned not only to survive these turbulent times  but also to gain market share as some of our competitors exit the industry 
as we continually monitor our business relationships with our licensees  we may determine from time to time that it is in our best interest to acquire a licensee s operations in order to mitigate certain risks associated with the poor performance or potential failure of a licensee 
such risks include loss of receivables or underlying collateral  potential impairment of the value of our investments in real estate used by a licensee or exposure to contingent liabilities under lease guarantees  and potential harm to our market share and brand integrity within a licensee s market 
in addition  we are sometimes approached by our licensees to acquire all or certain stores operated by the licensee 
we evaluate such opportunities considering  among other things  the viability of the market and our participation in the store real estate 

table of contents analysis of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal contained weeks 
net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and operating loss were as follows for the years ended november   november  and november  net sales gross profit sg a bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges unusual charges gains  net loss from operations sales for fiscal were  as compared to  for and  for  representing increases decreases of and  respectively 
these trends are primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions  which have impacted both retail sales and wholesale shipments in all three years  although in we began to see some improvement in these conditions 
our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows wholesale retail inter company elimination consolidated net sales gross margins for fiscal   and were   and  respectively 
the margin increases result primarily from a greater mix of sales being through the retail segment as well as improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  increased  in as compared to primarily due to the increase in the number of retail stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  decreased  in as compared to due to the reduction of administrative overhead and a general trend toward lower spending 
bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges decreased  in from levels due to our efforts to work diligently with the licensees to control increases in accounts and notes receivable exposure 
in addition  many of the distressed licensee owned stores for which significant bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges were required in have since been acquired by us and are now run as company owned stores 
bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges increased by  in over as the deepening effects of the recession continued to put increasing pressure on the profitability and cash flow of our licensees 
our operating loss in is primarily due to continuing elevated bad debt charges in our wholesale segment and operating losses incurred by our retail segment 
these retail operating losses reflect both the continuing weakness in the home furnishings retail environment  the shortfall between the amount of sales required to breakeven on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered  and costs associated with the acquisition and stabilization of distressed licensee stores 
however  in we did see a significant reduction in the amount of bad debt charges taken at the wholesale level  and we have begun to see slight improvement in the retail environment 
we continue to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new value oriented product offerings  strengthening our design and sales 
table of contents talent  and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of our stores 
in addition  we are closing underperforming stores that we do not believe will be able to meet their required breakeven sales levels 
in the recently acquired stores  it has generally taken six to twelve months of operations by corporate retail management to either implement the changes necessary to improve performance in these stores or to make a final determination regarding their on going viability 
in our wholesale segment  we have reduced the cost and expense structure to reflect this lower level of sales and the reduced number of stores in the total network

in an effort to mitigate the stock outages caused by these delays and improve service levels to our customers  we began to increase inventory levels during the second and third quarters of as a result  we were able to substantially eliminate the excess backlog of delayed shipments during the final quarter of the year 
approximately and of wholesale shipments during and  respectively  were imported products 
gross margins for the wholesale segment were for as compared to for this increase is due to improved margins on the imported wood and upholstery products as well as the closure of the fiberboard plant during the fourth quarter of which essentially operated at a breakeven gross profit during  partially offset by the introduction of a lower cost upholstery line that has a slightly lower margin  and higher freight costs on imported product during the fourth quarter of wholesale sg a expense  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  declined  or  for as compared to  due primarily to lower spending due to lower sales and continued cost cutting measures

while we do not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the customer  we track written sales the dollar value of sales orders taken  rather than delivered as a key store performance indicator 
written sales for comparable stores during decreased from the smaller decline in written sales relative to the larger decline in delivered sales at comparable stores reflects improved market conditions in the latter half of  as compared with weaker conditions in late which adversely impacted our shipping rates during the first quarter of gross margins for increased percentage point compared to due to improved pricing and promotional strategies and improved clearance margins

other income and expense items for fiscal  and are as follows loss from alternative asset fund income from marketable securities other than temporary impairment of investments income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net interest expense loan and lease guarantee expense other other income loss  net historically  our marketable securities have been held by two different money managers and consisted of a combination of equity and fixed income securities  including money market funds 
during the second quarter of  we liquidated our equity holdings with one of the managers and reinvested the proceeds in various money market funds  individual bonds and bond funds 
during the first quarter of  we liquidated the equity holdings with the other manager and reinvested those funds in money market accounts 
as a result  we recognized gains of  during  which included  of gains and of losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income 
the alternative asset fund recorded a loss of  for fiscal as compared to a loss of  in fiscal in fiscal  we requested our general partner in the alternative asset fund  private advisors  llc  to attempt to liquidate all of our investments in the fund

we review our marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost basis of the security and include the loss in current earnings as opposed to recording an unrealized holding loss 
due to the decline in the financial markets during fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal  many of our holdings sustained significant losses 
consequently  we recorded  and  in other than temporary losses in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision benefit of   and  in fiscal  and the benefit recognized in fiscal arose primarily as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on unrecognized state tax benefits  partially offset by the accrual of income taxes to be paid in certain states and penalties associated with certain unrecognized tax benefits 
the benefit recognized in fiscal resulted from our utilization of additional net operating loss carrybacks as provided by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of which extended the general carryback period for nols from two years to up to five 
fiscal includes a charge of  to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets as a result of the cumulative losses incurred in fiscal and our effective income tax rates are  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
excluding the charge to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our effective rate would have been in fiscal the effective rate for all three years was favorably impacted by exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc and unfavorably impacted in fiscal and by the write offs of goodwill 
see also note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective income tax rate for fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the current difficult industry conditions  to allow us to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute our long term retail strategies 
due to the continued housing slump and deterioration in the major financial markets and the overall recessionary economic environment  consumer spending has decreased  resulting in significant financial losses for us and damaging the ability of certain of our licensees to generate sufficient cash flow in their businesses 
during fiscal  we implemented measures to reduce operating expenses and improve working capital to enhance our cash flow  and have continued to carefully manage our cost structure and working capital throughout fiscal the following table summarizes our quarterly cash flows from operations for fiscal operating cash flow th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and respectively 
the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal over fiscal is a result of our continued close management of operating expenses and working capital  including some improvement in collections on accounts receivable  partially offset by a planned build up of inventory during the second and third quarters of operating cash flow during the third quarter of declined  from the second quarter of primarily due to our initiative to replenish our inventory of imported goods to remedy stock outages experienced during the first half of in addition  the stock outages we experienced had a negative impact on cash collections from our licensees during the third quarter which also contributed to the decline in operating cash flow 
by the end of the fourth quarter of  we had successfully restored our inventories to the levels required to maintain the desired service levels to our customers  resulting in improved deliveries and collections during the final quarter of the year 
our overall cash position decreased during by  primarily due to debt repayments of  partially offset by our operational cash flow of  and cash flows from investing activities of  cash used in financing activities during included the repayment of the entire  outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility  the repayment of the  mortgage on the mt 
pleasant  south carolina property  the repayment of the  balance on a mortgage which matured on march   principal payments of  in connection with the extension of two mortgages in december of  plus other regularly scheduled payments on our other mortgages and notes totaling  these uses were partially offset by proceeds of from the issuance of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by investing activities of  during included proceeds of  from the eminent domain settlement on our mt 
pleasant  south carolina property and from the resumption of dividend payments by ihfc  partially offset by capital expenditures of  primarily related to the opening of two company stores 
in addition to the  of cash on hand  we have investments of  consisting of  in bond and money market funds and individual debt securities and in fortress 
with the current level of cash on hand coupled with the investment holdings and availability on the revolver  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
receivables and inventory cash collections on our accounts and notes receivable have a significant impact on our overall liquidity 
while our cash flow from operations during fiscal was adversely affected by an increase in accounts receivable before reserves due to the continued difficult environment at retail resulting in lower cash collections  this trend eased somewhat during however  cash collections during the third quarter of were adversely affected by delayed shipments due to stock outages 
shipments improved significantly during the fourth quarter  and we had begun to see the expected resulting improvement in collections from our customers by the end of the year 
our percentage of accounts receivable that are over days past due has decreased from approximately at november  to approximately at november  we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during as compared to  during this significant decrease in charges is primarily due to the company working diligently with the licensees to better manage accounts and notes receivable exposure  as well as the takeover of certain licensees for which we had previously recorded significant charges 
in response to slow collections from certain of our licensees  those licensees have been placed on a temporary cash before delivery program for current orders that is designed to prevent any additional increase in the accounts receivable exposure 
we expect the rate of cash collections to increase when the recessionary 
table of contents environment begins to subside such that our total receivables will begin to decrease 
the following table reflects our accounts receivable and notes receivable and related bad debt reserves november  november  gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable gross notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable net notes receivable our accounts and notes receivable reserve and notes discount activity for fiscal are as follows accounts receivable notes receivable total balance at november  bad debt and note valuation charges write offs discount amortization balance at november  our licensee review committee lrc consists of our ceo  vp chief accounting officer  senior vp of retail  vp of licensed retail  vp general counsel  and corporate director of credit 
the lrc meets frequently to review licensee performance  typically reviewing a wide range of licensee related issues  including licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee and its sales 
should a licensee have substantial past due amounts due to us  but is otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  the committee has  in the past  decided to move all or a portion of the licensee s past due accounts receivable to a note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
due to continued liquidity issues with our licensees  we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
our accounts and notes receivable are secured by the filing of security statements in accordance with the uniform commercial code and or real estate owned by the note holder and in some cases  personal guarantees by our licensees 
our practice has generally been to work with the store owner to run a going out of business sale and use any proceeds to fund the remaining receivable 
our success with these events has varied 
however  typically the amounts recovered have not been materially different from the carrying amount of the receivable 
consequently  we generally have not been required to record significant bad debt expenses upon the conclusion of the event 
our investment in inventory affects our liquidity in several different ways 
first  cash paid for raw materials  labor  and factory overhead for the manufacture or assembly of our domestic inventories is typically paid out well in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories 
payments for our imported inventories are funded much further in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories as compared to our domestically manufactured or assembled inventories 
the length of our import supply chain necessitates complex forecasting of future demand levels and is highly judgmental 
in economic downturns  the speed at which we can respond to decreasing demand is slowed  as we typically have imported inventory in shipment or being manufactured at any given time 
in addition  we may also have inventory commitments under purchase orders 
table of contents that have not begun the manufacturing process 
consequently  as inventories build temporarily during downturns or as we near new product roll outs  our liquidity is reduced as we have more cash invested in our products 
second  the availability under our revolving credit facility is impacted by changes in our inventory balances 
lastly  if we fail to respond to changes in consumer tastes quickly enough  inventories may build and decrease our liquidity 
our inventories consist of the following november  november  wholesale finished goods work in process raw materials and supplies retail merchandise total inventories on first in  first out method lifo adjustment reserve for excess and obsolete inventory we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand  market conditions and the respective valuations at lifo 
the need for these reserves is primarily driven by the normal product life cycle 
as products mature and sales volumes decline  we rationalize our product offerings to respond to consumer tastes and keep our product lines fresh 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in determining reserves  we calculate separate reserves on our wholesale and retail inventories 
our wholesale inventories tend to carry the majority of the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory due to the nature of our distribution model 
these wholesale reserves primarily represent design and or style obsolescence 
typically  product is not shipped to our retail warehouses until a consumer has ordered and paid a deposit for the product 
we do not typically hold retail inventory for stock purposes 
consequently  floor sample inventory and inventory for delivery to customers account for the majority of our inventory at retail 
retail reserves are based on accessory and clearance floor sample inventory in our stores and any inventory that is not associated with a specific customer order in our retail warehouses 
activity in the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory by segment is as follows wholesale segment retail segment total balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  our estimates and assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past 
we did not make any significant changes to our methodology for determining inventory reserves in and do not anticipate that our methodology is reasonably likely to change in the future 
a plus or minus change in our inventory reserves would not have been material to our financial statements for the periods presented 

table of contents investments in recent years and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal  we have returned significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases  the funding for which has been primarily from the orderly liquidation of our alternative asset fund investment and net liquidations of our marketable securities portfolio 
however  due to unprecedented turmoil in the financial markets  further erosion of home furnishings sales  and general uncertainty regarding the depths to which current economic conditions could worsen  the board of directors decided to suspend regular quarterly dividends commencing with the second quarter of cash dividends paid for the first quarter of were  and was paid for the repurchase of shares during during we received  for the liquidation of our investments in styx partners  lp and hbk fund 
lp due to the level of the remaining assets in the alternative assets fund  we dissolved our partnership with private advisors  llc effective december   and the fund s remaining investment interest in fortress was transferred to us along with a cash distribution of we do not expect the liquidation of our interest in fortress to be accomplished in the near term 
debt and other obligations we currently have no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility with  of availability after deducting amounts for outstanding letters of credit and guarantees under the licensee loan program 
the revolving credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain defined financial covenants including a minimum level of tangible net worth  as defined in the credit agreement 
the facility allows borrowings of up to  has a variable interest rate of libor plus with a minimum rate on november  and carries a tangible net worth requirement at a minimum of  for fiscal at november   our tangible net worth was  borrowings under the facility are secured by a pledge of certain marketable securities and substantially all of our receivables and inventories 
our borrowing base  as defined  is a function of the levels of our accounts receivable  inventory  and investments in marketable securities 
to the extent the value of the marketable securities falls below  our borrowing base is decreased by of the difference between  and the actual value of those securities 
at november   the value of our marketable securities portfolio was  the facility matured on november   but has been extended under its present terms to march  we expect to have an amended and extended facility in place prior to the extended expiration and do not anticipate any interruption in our credit availability 
four mortgages on our real estate totaling  will mature during the twelve month period following november  we expect to satisfy these obligations through a combination of refinancing  borrowing from our revolving credit facility  or by utilizing operating cash flow 
while  there can be no assurance that any of these strategies will be successful  we do not believe that the repayment of these mortgages during would be materially detrimental to our overall liquidity 
we lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our company owned retail stores as well as in the operation of licensee owned stores 
we had obligations of  at november  for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year 
we also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators 
lease guarantees range from one to ten years 
we were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of  at november  we have also guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for those stores 
the total contingent liabilities with respect to these loan guarantees were  at november  capital expenditures we currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately  to  and will be used primarily for the up fit of newly acquired stores and remodeling of existing company owned stores 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change 
table of contents depending on many factors  including but not limited to the overall performance of the new prototype stores  our rate of growth  our operating results and any adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to industry conditions  competition  acquisition opportunities or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing cash and investment portfolio and our borrowing capacity  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for fair value measurements we account for items measured at fair value in accordance with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc s valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
asc classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy level inputs quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level inputs instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
areas which involve significant fair value estimates in determining the amounts recognized in our financial statements and the level of inputs utilized are as follows note references refer to our consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report hierarchy level of utilized inputs financial statement note reference marketable securities level note investment in fortress level note acquisitions goodwill level note loan lease guarantees level note all other fair value estimates which are made for disclosure purposes only utilize level inputs see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments we are currently engaged in negotiations for the sale of our interest in ihfc 
no definitive agreement for the sale has been reached 
any sale would be made only as part of the simultaneous sale of of the ownership interests in ihfc to the prospective purchaser 
we are one of four shareholders of ihfc 
should the negotiations for the sale of ihfc be successful  we will likely realize significant cash proceeds in fiscal in addition to further strengthening our balance sheet and cash on hand  these proceeds  net of applicable income taxes  may be utilized by us in a number of ways including  for example  the retirement of debt and certain other long term obligations  the settlement of various obligations related to closed stores and idle facilities  paying a dividend and or funding stock buybacks and or funding any potential future working capital needs 
we  however  can provide no assurance that the negotiations will conclude successfully 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the ordinary course of business see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and other commercial commitments and the fiscal year in which they are expected to be paid 
thereafter total post employment benefit obligations real estate notes payable other obligations commitments interest payable letters of credit operating leases lease guarantees loan guarantees purchase obligations total does not reflect a reduction for the impact of any company owned life insurance proceeds to be received

the company is not a party to any long term supply contracts with respect to the purchase of raw materials or finished goods 
at the end of fiscal year  we had approximately  in open purchase orders  primarily for imported inventories  which are in the ordinary course of business 
lease and loan guarantees related to payments we would only be required to make in the event of default on the part of the guaranteed parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize stand by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business 
we lease land and buildings that are primarily used in the operation of bhf and bfd stores 
we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators as part of our retail strategy 
we also have guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for these stores 
see contractual obligations and commitments table above and note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k  for further discussion of operating leases  lease guarantees and loan guarantees  including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements 
contingencies we are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these legal and environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the facts presently known  it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires that certain estimates and 
table of contents assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
we also consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our payment terms generally vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received 
during fiscal  and  there were seven  thirteen and five dealers  respectively  for which these criteria were not met and therefore revenue was being recognized on a cost recovery basis 
as of november  and november   two and seven dealers  respectively  remained on the cost recovery basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our accounts receivable reserves were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross accounts receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified customer accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees and other customers on a quarterly basis based on factors such as their financial condition  our collateral position  potential future plans with licensees and other similar factors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivable and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and present economic conditions and trends 
in the current economic environment  our historical experience with customers carries less weight than in previous years 
the timeliness of a licensee s or customer s ability to pay us can deteriorate at a much faster pace than in previous years 
as such  despite our best efforts  the ultimate precision with respect to our allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be less when compared to previous periods 
although actual losses have not differed materially from our previous estimates  future losses could differ from our current estimates 
unforeseen events such as a licensee or customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
long term notes receivable previously  when in the ordinary course of business a licensee had substantial past due amounts due to the company  but was otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  we may have decided to move all or a portion of a licensee s past due accounts receivable to a long term interest bearing note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
due to continued liquidity issues with our licensees  we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
some of these notes are collateralized by real estate 
at the inception of the note receivable  we determine whether the note bears a market rate of interest 
in estimating a market rate of interest  we first consider factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee 
table of contents operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
for those licensees where there is a concern of collectibility  our estimated market rate of interest is based on certain published high yield bond indices 
for those where collectibility is less of a concern  the estimated market rate of interest is generally based on the prime rate 
a discount on the note is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate below the market rate and a premium is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate above the market rate 
we amortize the related note discount or premium over the contractual term of the note and cease amortizing the discount to interest income when the present value of expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the note 
interest income associated with the discount amortization is immaterial and is recorded in other loss  net  in our consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis we examine these notes for evidence of impairment  considering factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
after considering these factors  should we believe that all or a portion of the note receivable cannot or will not be paid  we record an impairment charge on the note using discounted cash flow methods to determine the impairment charge 
an impairment charge does not necessarily indicate that a loan has no recovery or salvage value  but rather that  based on management s judgment and the consideration of specific licensee factors  it is more prudent than not to record an impairment charge 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross notes receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets we evaluate our deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
a valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
investments investments are marked to market and recorded at their fair value 
we account for our investment in fortress by marking it to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the fund manager  adjusted for estimated liquidity discounts 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from income and are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from securities classified as available for sale are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method for ascertaining the cost of securities sold 
we also review our available for sale securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost of the security and include the loss in current earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  we consider such factors as the significance of the decline as compared to the cost basis  the current state of the financial markets and the economy  the length of time for which there has been an unrealized loss and the relevant information regarding the operations of the investee 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
the acquisition of assets and liabilities and any resulting goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit  wholesale  retail or real estate investments 
we review goodwill at the reporting unit level annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of vies  which became effective for our first quarter of fiscal this new guidance requires entities to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the enterprise is required to assess  on an ongoing basis  whether it is a primary beneficiary or has an implicit responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed 
this guidance changes the previous quantitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary to a qualitative approach based on which entity a has the power to direct activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact economic performance and b has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to the variable purpose entity 
in addition  it requires enhanced disclosures that will provide investors with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity 
we have adopted these provisions and there was no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations  now codified primarily in asc topic asc now requires that the acquisition method of accounting  instead of the purchase method  be applied to all business combinations and that an acquirer is identified in the process 
the guidance requires that fair market value be used to recognize assets and assumed liabilities instead of the cost allocation method where the costs of an acquisition are allocated to individual assets based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill would be calculated as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired  however  negative goodwill will be recognized immediately as a gain instead of being allocated to individual assets acquired 
costs of the acquisition will be recognized separately from the business combination 
the guidance became effective for us beginning in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report regarding the application of asc to the acquisition of licensee stores during fiscal in october  the fasb issued asu no

 certain arrangements that include software elements  asu 
asu requires entities to allocate revenues in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables using a selling price hierarchy associated with the relative selling price method 
asu removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu and asu should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu or asu will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition

 which updates the guidance in asc topic  intangibles goodwill other 
the amendments in asu affect all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in asu modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance will become effective for us at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in asc topic  business combinations 
the objective of asu is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity as defined by asc that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
this guidance will become effective for us for acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor 
the interest cost of the credit facility is affected by changes in short term interest rates and increases in those rates can adversely affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in market prices of our marketable securities 
at november   we had  in marketable securities which consisted of a portfolio of fixed income securities and money market funds 
maturity dates on the fixed income securities in the portfolio range from one to twenty years 
as part of our current debt facility  we have pledged certain of our marketable securities as collateral 
to the extent the value of the marketable securities falls below  our borrowing base  as defined  is decreased by of the difference between  and the actual value of those securities 
accordingly  the effect on our borrowing base at november  is a reduction of  we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies 
substantially all of our imports purchased outside of north america are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in us dollars would not be material to our results from operations in fiscal we are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes  principally wood  woven fabric  and foam products 
a recovery in home construction could result in increases in wood and fabric costs from current levels  and the cost of foam products  which are petroleum based  is sensitive to changes in the price of oil 

table of contents we have potential exposure to market risk related to the current weakness in the commercial real estate market 
our retail real estate holdings of  for licensee operated stores as well as our holdings of  for company owned stores at november  could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties in the current market 
additionally  if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the  of lease obligations we have guaranteed on behalf of licensees as of november   we may not be able to secure sufficient sub lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees
