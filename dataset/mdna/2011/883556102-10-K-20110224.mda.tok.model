the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
the company s continuing operations fall into two business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services 
revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of customers 
dollars in millions revenues analytical technologies laboratory products and services eliminations sales in were billion  an increase of million from aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions  net of divestitures discussed in total and by segment below  revenues increased from revenues by million due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases 
sales rebounded from a weak when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity continued on december   the company and dionex corporation  a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems  announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a transaction under which thermo fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of dionex for per share in cash  or a total purchase price of approximately billion 
dionex  headquartered in sunnyvale  california  is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems  consumables  and software for chemical analysis 
dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences  chemical  petrochemical  food and beverage  power generation  and electronics industries 
their expertise in applications and instrumentation helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals  establish environmental regulations  and produce better industrial products 
the transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals 
in  operating income and operating income margin were billion and  respectively  compared with billion and  respectively  in the increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and  to a lesser extent  productivity improvements  global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions 
in addition  amortization expense decreased by million in  primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a acquisition 
the company s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision in was favorably affected by million or percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates 
the company expects its effective tax rate in will be between and based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business 
the tax provision in was favorably affected by million or percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates 
income from continuing operations increased to billion in  from million in  primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income  offset in part by a higher tax rate 
during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled billion  compared with billion for the decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items  particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales 
as of december   the company s outstanding debt totaled billion  of which approximately billion is convertible debt  at a conversion price of per share

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity continued the company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of million as of december   and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement  are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  business combinations  intangible assets and goodwill  equity investments  sales returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  pension costs and stock based compensation 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b inventories the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding months  expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining i fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized 
the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
amortizable intangible assets totaled billion at december  the company reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset

table of contents thermo fisher scientific inc 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled billion and billion  respectively  at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the company s businesses were adversely affected in by the global economic downturn  although results progressively improved during the year and in projections of profitability for and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at december  there can be no assurance  however  that an economic recovery will continue into and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
d other long lived assets the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled billion at december   including billion of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary 
e revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected

table of contents thermo fisher scientific inc 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements 
in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed  based on vsoe  which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers 
should a greater or lesser number of products be returned  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
f warranty obligations at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
g income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
the company s reserve for these matters totaled million at december  where applicable  associated interest expense has also been recognized 
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and  as a result  is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non us tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance 
any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
accrued income taxes totaled million at december  should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained  a reduction in the company s tax provision would result 
h contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies  including legal proceedings  environmental  workers compensation  product  general and auto liabilities  and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the accruals are based on management s judgment  historical claims experience  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates 
reserves of acquired businesses  including environmental reserves  were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value 
additionally  the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 
i pension and other retiree benefits several of the company s us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled million in the company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at year end compared with million at year end should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately million 
the company expects to contribute between and million to its defined benefit pension plans in

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued j stock based compensation the fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
for option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions  a lattice model is used to estimate fair value 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
the compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures 
if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures  adjustments to compensation expense may be required

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products 
the new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available 
the guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer s consideration using this relative selling price model 
the new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product 
under the new standard  such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software 
the company adopted the rules prospectively on january  adoption did not materially affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
effective january   the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities 
the new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities 
this amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis  based on which enterprise has both the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity 
adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
