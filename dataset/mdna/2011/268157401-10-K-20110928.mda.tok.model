item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
overview our principal business is the distribution and marketing of physical medicine products and aesthetic products  many of which we design and manufacture 
we offer a broad line of medical equipment including therapy devices  medical supplies and soft goods  treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment 
our line of aesthetic equipment includes aesthetic massage and microdermabrasion devices  as well as skin care products 
our products are sold to and used primarily by physical therapists  chiropractors  sports medicine practitioners  podiatrists  plastic surgeons  dermatologists  aestheticians and other aesthetic services providers 
our fiscal year ends on june reference to fiscal year refers to the year ended june  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year sales of manufactured capital equipment were lower than in  due to lower demand associated with the ongoing general economic weakness and the uncertainty surrounding the future effects of health care reform in the united states 
the drop in sales of manufactured capital equipment in was offset by increased sales of distributed exercise equipment and certain medical supplies 
historically  uncertain economic times limit growth and expansion that typically create the demand for capital equipment 
although our three initial gpo contracts with amerinet  premier and first choice began on march   they did not contribute materially to sales in fiscal year we began the process of introducing dynatronics branded products to gpo member facilities in march while the process of converting business to our brand will take time  we are optimistic about the potential of this new market for the company 
sales of manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately and of our physical medicine product sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
distribution of products manufactured by other suppliers accounted for the balance of our physical medicine product sales in those years 
sales of manufactured aesthetic products in fiscal years and represented approximately and of our aesthetic product sales  respectively  with distributed products making up the balance 
the majority of our sales revenues come from the sale of physical medicine products  both manufactured and distributed 
in fiscal years and  sales of physical medicine products accounted for of total sales 
chargeable repairs  billable freight revenue  aesthetic product sales and other miscellaneous revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues in and gross profit gross profit totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the slight decline in overall gross profit margin from fiscal year to fiscal year reflects the previously mentioned reduction in sales of manufactured capital equipment that provides some of the highest margin products offered by the company 
we expect sales of higher margin capital equipment will increase along with a corresponding improvement in gross profit margins as product sales to gpo members ramp up and as general economic conditions improve in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year during fiscal  we were able to reduce sg a by  compared tofiscal this was accomplished through lower outside professional fees and other general expenses including phone  legal and director fees  and lower sales commissions 
toward the end of fiscal year  we hired additional sales staff to focus on converting the gpo business to dynatronics brand of products 
research and development research and development r d expense increased  or  to  in fiscal year  from  in r d expense increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year to from of net sales in fiscal year the company is developing a number of important new products which are scheduled for release in fiscal year these development efforts are directly responsible for the increase in r d expenses 
this heavy development period is expected to normalize once the new products are released to the market 
we believe that developing new products is a key element in our growth strategy 
r d costs are expensed as incurred 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year due to lower negotiated borrowing rates  decreased borrowings and lower carrying balances on our bank line of credit compared to fiscal year pre tax income pre tax income decreased in fiscal year to  compared to  in fiscal year the reduction in pre tax income in fiscal year was due primarily to the  increase in r d expenses during the year 
lower sales and gross profit generated during the year were more than offset by lower sg a expenses and lower interest expense 
the introduction of new products in fiscal year along with higher sales volumes with gpos is expected to improve sales and profits going forward 
income tax provision income tax provision was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to in the lower effective tax rate in is primarily the result of increased r d credits and certain other items 
net income net income decreased to  
per share in fiscal year  compared to  
per share in fiscal year the lower net income in was caused primarily by  in increased r d expense together with lower net sales during the period  offset in part by reduced sg a expenses and lower interest expense 
we expect that r d expense will continue at present or higher levels over the coming quarters as the development of new products is completed and the products are introduced to the market later in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through available cash reserves and borrowings under a line of credit with a bank 
working capital was  as of june   inclusive of the current portion of long term obligations and credit facilities  compared to working capital of  as of june  during fiscal  we generated  in cash from operating activities through net income from operations as discussed above  together with  in depreciation and amortization expenses   in higher accounts payables  and other cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is due to development costs for the company s new e commerce website and e quote system  together with upgrade costs for our accounting software and other capital expenditures in fiscal cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal year  we made approximately  in principal payments on our long term debt in additional to paying down our line of credit by  we also used approximately  to repurchase shares of our common stock during fiscal year accounts receivable trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  trade accounts receivable represent amounts due from our dealer network as well as from medical practitioners and clinics 
we believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical knowledge and relationship with these customers 
accounts receivable are generally collected within days of the agreed terms 
inventories inventories  net of reserves  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  the amount of inventory we carry fluctuates each period based on the timing of large inventory purchases from overseas suppliers 
management anticipates that inventory levels will likely increase in the latter half of fiscal year in conjunction with the introduction of new products that are currently under development  the addition of new products associated with the new catalog release and in support of higher anticipated sales 
accounts payable accounts payable increased  to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase in accounts payable is a result of the timing of our weekly payments to suppliers and the timing of purchases of product components 
accounts payable are generally not aged beyond the terms of our suppliers 
we take advantage of available early payment discounts when offered by our vendors 
cash and cash equivalents our cash position as of june  was  compared to cash of  as of june  we expect that cash flows from operating activities  together with amounts available through an existing line of credit facility  will be sufficient to cover operating needs in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months 
if we experience an adverse operating environment  including a further worsening of the general economy in the united states  or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
line of credit during fiscal year  we paid down the outstanding balance on our line of credit by  leaving a remaining balance outstanding of  as of june   compared to  as of june  the current balance on the line of credit is the lowest it has been since the acquisition of six dealers in june and july and down approximately  from the line at its highest point in fiscal year the decrease in the line of credit was primarily the result of improved collections of accounts receivable  lower inventory levels  profits generated during fiscal year and cash flows from operating activities 
interest on the line of credit is based on the day libor rate as of june  plus 
the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories 
borrowing limitations are based on approximately of eligible inventory and up to of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum credit facility of  interest payments on the line are due monthly 
as of june   the borrowing base was approximately  resulting in approximately  available on the line 
the line of credit is renewable on december  and includes covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of june   we were in compliance with the loan covenants 
the current ratio was to as of june  compared to to as of june  current assets represented of total assets as of june  and june  debt long term debt excluding current installments totaled  as of june   compared to  as of june  long term debt is comprised primarily of the mortgage loans on our office and manufacturing facilities in utah and tennessee 
the principal balance on the mortgage loans is approximately  with monthly principal and interest payments of  for a more complete explanation of the long term debt  see note in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following summary sets forth information regarding significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record finished goods inventory at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual costs first in  first out or market 
raw materials are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation reserves are maintained for the estimated impairment of the inventory 
impairment may be a result of slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence or changes in the valuation of the inventory 
in determining the adequacy of reserves  we analyze the following  among other things current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecast sales  product obsolescence  technological innovations  and character of the inventory as a distributed item  finished manufactured item or raw material 
any modifications to estimates of inventory valuation reserves are reflected in the cost of goods sold within the statements of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
as of june  and  our inventory valuation reserve balance  which established a new cost basis  was  and  respectively  and our inventory balance was  and  net of reserves  respectively 
revenue recognition our sales force and distributors sell our products to end users  including physical therapists  professional trainers  athletic trainers  chiropractors  medical doctors and aestheticians 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped fob shipping point under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed for shipping and handling of products are recorded as sales revenue 
costs for shipping and handling of products to customers are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
deferred income tax assets in august and august  our management performed an analysis of the deferred income tax assets and their recoverability 
based on several factors  including our strong earnings history of pre tax profit averaging over  per year in of the last fiscal years and the fact that the principal causes of the loss in fiscal goodwill impairment and expenses resulting from six acquisitions are considered to be unusual and are not expected to recur in the near future  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
business plan and outlook in january and february  we announced the signing of contracts with three gpos premier  inc  amerinet and first choice 
in july  we announced the signing of a contract with a fourth gpo champs group purchasing 
these gpos represent tens of thousands of clinics and hospitals around the nation 
with the broader offering of products now available through our catalog and e commerce website  we are better able to compete for this high volume business 
over the past two years  we have also been successful in becoming a preferred vendor to many national and regional accounts 
we believe these contract signings represent important milestones toward our goal of expanding our customer base and increasing our market share 
the contracts with the gpos represent a license to solicit business directly from the members of the respective gpos 
the gpos do not order any product directly 
they serve the function of negotiating favorable pricing terms on behalf of their members 
most gpo members are loyal to the gpos in which they have membership and will not typically consider vendors that are not on contract 
our contract with amerinet covers all capital equipment we sell to their  clinic members 
capital equipment typically includes non commodity products over in price 
while we may solicit supply type business from amerinet customers  we are not under contract to do so 
our contract with first choice covers all products that we offer to their  members 
our contract with premier  inc is to provide products to their members in the colleges and universities and alternate markets category which is a smaller subset of their total membership 
we expect to realize broader benefits under the premier agreement as our involvement with this gpo exposes our products to all of their  healthcare category members 
we anticipate this exposure will create interest and possibilities for additional business from these healthcare members 
some of premier s healthcare members  including champs group purchasing  have negotiated contracts with us directly to obtain access to our products 
these contracts present us with significant opportunities for increasing sales in markets that have previously been unavailable to us 
cultivating business through these gpo contracts and seeking additional contracts with other gpos will be a major focal point for us in the coming year 
during fiscal year  we plan to introduce a new  updated version of our product catalog 
this new catalog will expand our product offering in order to better service the broader needs of gpo s and national accounts 
it will also provide an excellent new sales tool for all of our sales representatives in the field as well as provide a foundation for expanding our e commerce platform 
in december  we introduced to the physical medicine market a new electronic patient communications platform called stream 
stream is an automated service that leverages the latest technologies to connect practitioners with their patients via e mail  text messaging and social networking tools to provide state of the art communications and marketing tools for practitioners 
the system reduces patient no shows  reactivates past patients and generates new patients 
in addition  it provides a wide range of analytics and delivers automated appointment reminders all while improving staff efficiency 
the launch of this product has been slower than expected  but the reviews from those who are using the product are mostly very favorable 
the continued development of stream represents an opportunity to significantly improve overall gross margins and profitability for the company as each sale creates a recurring monthly revenue stream 
our efforts over the next year to work with our partner  solutionreach formerly smile reminder  to refine the presentation and implementation of this very unique and valuable service will be critical to significantly realizing the full potential of this program 
over the past few years  consolidations in our market have changed the landscape of our industry s distribution channels 
at the present time  we believe that there remain only two companies with a national direct sales force selling proprietary and distributed products dynatronics and patterson medical 
all other distribution in our market is directed through catalog companies with no direct sales force  or through independent local dealers 
however  the network of local independent dealers is diminishing due to consolidation in the market and the resulting increased competition from dynatronics  patterson medical and catalog companies 
in the past year  we have reinforced our direct sales team to include over direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
in addition to these direct sales representatives  we continue to enjoy a strong relationship with scores of local dealers 
we believe we have the best trained and most knowledgeable sales force in the industry 
the changes taking place within our market provide a unique opportunity for us to grow market share in the coming years through recruitment of high quality sales representatives and dealers 
to further our efforts to recruit high quality direct sales representatives and dealers as well as to better appeal to the large gpos and national customers  we intend to continue to improve efficiencies of our operations and the sales support for the industry 
chief among the steps we are taking to make these improvements was the introduction of our first true e commerce solution on july  with the introduction of this e commerce solution  customers are able to more easily place orders and obtain information about their accounts 
sales representatives are increasing their effectiveness with the abundance of information available to them electronically through our e quote system which is a companion to the e commerce solution introduced 
not only is our e commerce solution easy and efficient to use  it should also facilitate reducing transactional costs thus enabling us to accommodate higher sales without significantly increasing overhead 
the passage in of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and educational reconciliation act will affect our future operations 
the addition of millions to the rolls of the insured will increase demand for services 
that increased demand could lead to increased sales of our products 
the magnitude of those increases is difficult to assess at this time 
a negative impact of this legislation as enacted is its imposition of an excise tax on all manufacturers of medical devices 
our current estimate is that this tax would exceed  annually for dynatronics  barring a change in the statute 
because of the phase in of various provisions in the legislation  the full effects on our business and industry are not expected to be felt until at the earliest 
this makes it difficult to project the full impact this legislation will have on our business in future periods 
there is also a possibility that future congresses will amend the legislation prior to it becoming fully effective or the courts may rule all or part of the legislation unconstitutional 
in addition  rule making under the law is not yet complete 
in the meantime  we are working to take full advantage of every opportunity presented by this legislation to increase sales and to offset any negative effects that may accompany those opportunities 
we continue to focus research and development efforts on new product innovation and enhancing existing products 
several products are currently under development and are scheduled for introduction in the latter part of calendar the commitment to innovation of high quality products has been a hallmark of dynatronics and will continue throughout the coming year 
this renewed emphasis on r d contributed in large part to lower profitability in fiscal year r d costs for us have been cyclical in nature and are reflective of the fact we are in a more intense part of the development cycle 
once the new products are introduced  r d costs are expected to cycle back to a lower level until the next new products are further advanced in the development cycle 
management is confident the short term costs associated with the more intense part of the development cycle will yield long term benefits and are important to assuring that we maintain our reputation for being an innovator and leader in product development in the industry 
r d costs are expensed as incurred 
economic pressures from the recent recession in the united states have affected available credit that would facilitate large capital purchases  and have also reduced demand for discretionary services such as those provided by the purchasers of our aesthetic products 
as a result  we reduced our expenses in the synergie division 
the synergie elite aesthetic product line introduced in april continues to have appeal due to its design and price point 
we believe that our aesthetic devices remain the best value on the market and we are seeking innovative ways to market these products  including strategic partnerships  both domestic and international  to help regain sales momentum 
as the economy begins to improve  we expect to see increased sales of these higher margin products 
we have long believed that international markets present an untapped potential for growth and expansion 
adding new distributors in several countries will be the key to this expansion effort 
our past efforts to improve international marketing have yielded only marginal improvements 
we remain committed  however  to finding the most cost effective ways to expand our markets internationally 
over the coming year  our efforts will be focused on partnering with key manufacturers and distributors interested in our product line or technology 
our utah operation  where all electrotherapy  ultrasound  traction  light therapy and synergie products are manufactured  is certified to iso  an internationally recognized standard of excellence in medical device manufacturing 
this designation is an important requirement in obtaining the ce mark certification  which allows us to market our products in the european union and in other international locations 
refining our business model for supporting sales representatives and distributors also will be a focal point of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient ways to maintain our satellite sales offices and warehouses 
in addition  more emphasis is being placed on pricing management to protect margins for both manufactured and distributed products 
the ongoing refinement of this model is expected to yield further efficiencies that will better achieve sales goals while at the same time reduce expenses 
our efforts to prudently reduce costs in the face of some economic uncertainty have made us a leaner operation 
we will continue to be vigilant in maintaining appropriate overhead costs and operating costs while still building appropriate support for anticipated increases in sales 
the strategic decision four years ago to merge with key dealers and vertically integrate our operations has opened new opportunities for us to expand our distribution operations 
historically  we have been a manufacturer and designer of physical medicine and aesthetic products that also distributed a limited number of products from other manufacturers 
our business model is transforming with our sales of other manufacturers products now representing a greater share of our overall sales 
manufactured products continue to provide the majority of gross profit margin  but the growth trends we are forecasting indicate greater growth potential for distributed products over manufactured products 
therefore  during fiscal year we will evaluate ways of improving our business model to better reflect our growing role as a distributor of products and not just a manufacturer 
based on our defined strategic initiatives  we are focusing our resources in the following areas improving sales by pursuing business opportunities with gpos and large chains of clinics  including national and regional accounts 
introduction of a new product catalog featuring a broader product offering 
pursuing opportunities to introduce the stream software service to large groups of clinics and buying groups in addition to making it available to individual practitioners 
reinforcing distribution through a strategy of recruiting direct sales representatives and working closely with the most successful distributors of capital equipment 
using our first e commerce solution in order to facilitate business opportunities and reduce transactional costs 
maintaining operational efficiencies by monitoring manufacturing and transactional costs  automating processes  redefining policies and procedures and working to make every customer a profitable customer 
strengthening pricing management and procurement methodologies 
minimizing expense associated with the synergie product line until the economy improves and demand for capital equipment re emerges  and  in the meantime  seeking additional independent distributors and strategic partnerships 
focusing international sales efforts on identifying key distributors and strategic partners who could represent the company s product line  particularly in europe 
continuing development of new state of the art products  both high tech and commodity  in fiscal year  primarily for the rehabilitation markets 
improve efficiencies as a distributor of other manufacturers products and consider ways to enhance our role as a distributor and not just a manufacturer 
exploring strategic business alliances that will leverage and complement our competitive strengths  increase market reach and supplement capital resources
