the purpose of the non gaap information is to report our financial information without certain income and expense items in  and  as if our results from venezuela had been translated at the less favorable parallel exchange rate in and  and after adjusting tax expense for certain items 
the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide information to assist comparability and estimates of future performance 
the adjustments are described in detail and are reconciled to our gaap results on pages versus gaap basis our revenues were slightly lower than and our operating profit declined million or in our earnings per share from continuing operations was  down from last year 
revenues were lower mainly due to unfavorable currency effects related primarily to a change in the way we translate our venezuelan results to us dollars 
revenues also declined due to exiting a french guarding business in and a cit business in belgium in revenues were favorably affected in by organic growth in our international segment and incremental revenues from the acquisition of a cit business in mexico 
our earnings in were lower than primarily because of a million income tax valuation allowance reversal in  lower profits in ven ezuela as a result of a change in the way we translate those results  a million gain in related to an acquisition in india  a million income tax charge in related to us healthcare legislation  million of losses recognized related to the exit of the cit business in belgium  and a million net loss related to the mexican acquisition

profits in north america were lo wer than on price and volume pressure 
versus gaap basis our revenues and operating profit declined in our segment margin declined in an environment that was extremely difficult for customers in the banking  retail  and diamond and jewelry sectors 
the operating profit decline was primarily due to a highly profitable monetary conversion project in venezuela in  a million repatriation charge and higher retirement expenses  partially offset by a million gain on an acquisition in india 
the million repatriation charge was the result of our decision to repatriate million bolivar fuertes from our venezuelan operations at the parallel market rate 
in addition  acquired businesses helped revenues and operating profit in non gaap basis our revenues and operating profit declined in revenues in decreased primarily due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates  partially offset by the net positive effect of businesses acquired and disposed in the operating profit decline was primarily due to a highly profitable monetary conversion project in venezuela in and higher severance and restructuring costs in outlook for our organic revenue growth rate for is expected to be in the mid to high single digit range

definition of organic growth organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period  excluding the effect of the following items acquisitions and dispositions  currency effects as described on page  and the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting 
business and strategy overview we have four geographic operating segments europe  middle east  and africa emea  latin america  asia pacific  and north america  which are aggregated into two reportable segments international and north america 
our north america segment includes operations in the us and canada 
our newly acquired mexican operation is included in our latin american operating segment 
we believe that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for a high level of service and security risk management and logistics expertise global infrastructure and customer base proprietary cash processing and information systems proven operational excellence high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength we focus our time and resources on service quality  protecting and strengthening our brand  and addressing our risks 
we are a premium provider of services in most of the markets we serve 
our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the brink s brand  so we seek to protect and build its value 
since our services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  we strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying our approach is an understanding that we must be disciplined and patient enough to charge prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for our investors 
business environments around the world change constantly 
we must adapt to changes in competitive landscapes  regional economies and each customer s level of business 
we balance underlying business risk and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of our resources 
as a result  we operate largely on a decentralized basis so local management can react quickly to changes in the business environment 
we measure financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial measures are return on capital revenue and earnings growth cash flow generation these and similar measures are critical components of our incentive compensation plans and performance evaluations 
because of our emphasis on managing risks while providing a high level of service  we focus our marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of our services  information and risk management capabilities  and financial strength 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital  we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources as well as appropriate pricing levels 
we attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
due to our higher investment in people and processes  we generally charge higher prices than competitors that do not provide the same level of service and risk management 
the industries we serve have been consolidating 
as a result  the demands and expectations of customers in these industries have grown 
customers are increasingly seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
operating results may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  costs are incurred to prepare to serve  or to transition away  from a customer 
we also periodically incur costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  safety and security costs can vary depending on performance  cost of insurance coverage  and changes in crime rates ie  attacks and robberies 
cash logistics is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through bank deposit 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange including same day credit capabilities 
retail customers use brink s cash logistics services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information  and to replenish customer coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash logistics involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are charged higher prices  which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash logistics to customers differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
management is focused on continuing to grow cash logistics revenue 
brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season 
former operations on october   we completed the tax free spin off of brink s home security holdings  inc bhs  a former monitored security business in north america

overview our effective tax rate has varied in the past three years from the statutory us federal rate due to various factors  including changes in judgment about the need for valuation allowances changes in the geographical mix of earnings a nondeductible venezuela repatriation charge nontaxable acquisition gains and losses changes in laws in the us and france timing of benefit recognition for uncertain tax positions state income taxes we establish or reverse valuation allowances for deferred tax assets depending on all available information including historical and expected future operating performance of our subsidiaries 
changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances 
based on our historical and future expected taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
outlook the effective income tax rate for is expected to be between and 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate materially from these estimates due to changes in forecasted permanent book tax differences  the expected geographical mix of earnings  changes in current or deferred taxes due to legislative changes  changes in valuation allowances or accruals for contingencies and other factors 
continuing operations compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was higher than the us statutory tax rate largely due to a million reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of us healthcare legislation enacted in  and million in higher taxes related to non us tax jurisdictions  partially offset by a million non cash income tax benefit related to a tax settlement 
non us taxes were higher than primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance position as a result of our assessment of historical and future taxable income  the characterization of a french business tax as an income tax based upon legislative changes effective january  and a nondeductible loss on the mexico acquisition 
compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was lower than the us statutory tax rate due to million in lower tax expense primarily resulting from the reversal of a us valuation allowance  million in lower taxes due to the nontaxable india gain  partially offset by million in higher taxes due to the nondeductible venezuela repatriation charge 
see application of critical accounting policies deferred tax asset valuation allowance on page for an explanation of a description of our accounting policy  assumptions used and a sensitivity analysis 
compared to us statutory rate the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was lower than the us statutory tax rate due to a net million decrease in our valuation allowance position in us and us jurisdictions as a result of our assessment of historical and future taxable income in these jurisdictions 
in addition  there was a million decrease in the non us tax provision  primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings in the foreign jurisdictions 
other as of december   we have not recorded us federal deferred income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity affiliates in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for income taxes special areas  as amended 
we expect that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in operations outside the us it is not practical to compute the estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings 
noncontrolling interests years ended december  change in millions net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in was primarily due to a decrease in the earnings of our venezuelan subsidiaries as a result of reporting results at a less favorable exchange rate 
the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in was primarily due to a decrease in the earnings of our venezuelan operations driven mainly by the absence of the highly profitable currency conversion project

we have insurance coverage applicable to this matter and we have collected million from insurance companies in bhs spin off on october   we distributed all of our interest in bhs to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on october   in a tax free distribution 
we distributed one share of bhs common stock for every share of our common stock outstanding 
we contributed million in cash to bhs at the time of the spin off 
we also forgave all the existing intercompany debt owed by bhs to us as of the distribution date 
bhs offered monitored security services in north america primarily for owner occupied  single family residences 
to a lesser extent  bhs offered security services for commercial and multi family properties 
bhs typically installed and owned the on site security systems and charged fees to monitor and service the systems 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a tax matters agreement with bhs which provided a basis for the preparation and filing of tax returns for pre spin and post spin operations of bhs in as authorized by the tax matters agreement  we made certain elections related to bhs operations for our us federal and state consolidated tax returns in these elections have the effect of decreasing the net deferred tax assets allocated to bhs at the time of the spin off 
as a result  we increased the amount of our current income tax receivable during by million  with an offsetting increase in retained earnings to adjust the amount of the spin off distribution

foreign operations we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
we are subject to risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments 
changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future effects  if any  of these risks cannot be predicted 
our international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the us dollar 
brink s venezuela is subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted 
see application of critical accounting policies foreign currency translation on page for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our venezuelan operation in our consolidated financial statements  and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a on page at december   no material foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources overview over the last three years  we have used cash generated from our continuing operations to invest in the infrastructure of our business new facilities  cash sorting and other equipment for our cash logistics operations  armored trucks  compusafe units  and customer facing and back office information technology million  acquire businesses million including million in  primarily in mexico and canada  and million in bric brazil  russia  india and china countries in  repurchase shares of our stock million  make voluntary contributions to our primary us pension plan million  and pay dividends million 
in addition  we contributed million to our home security business prior to the spin off of the business to our shareholders in outlook we continue to consider acquisition opportunities in the secure transportation and cash logistics industry and in adjacent security markets 
we may use our cash from operations and borrowings to fund the purchase of these acquisitions 
we may be required to contribute cash to our us pension plans in the future  and the amount of contributions may exceed the amount of cash provided by our us subsidiaries 
we may choose to borrow cash in the us rather than pay incremental taxes that we would owe upon repatriation 
we began translating cash flows from our venezuelan operations at a less favorable rate late in as a result  our cash flow amounts reported for these operations in and the future will be lower than prior years 
summary cash flow information years ended december  change in millions cash flows from operating activities continuing operations before contributions to us pension plan and change in customer obligations and income tax payments payment of income taxes increase in customer obligations contributions to primary us pension plan subtotal discontinued operations operating activities cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures acquisitions cash held by bhs at the spin off date other discontinued operations investing activities cash flows before financing activities operating activities operating cash flows increased by million in compared to as a result of a million increase in cash flow from continuing operations  offset by a million decrease in cash flow from discontinued operations 
operating cash flows from continuing operations were higher in mainly due to a million cash contribution made in to our us pension plan 
our operating cash flows in also included million of income tax refunds  much of which were primarily the result of tax deductions associated with the us pension cash contribution and million of brink s common stock that was also contributed to the plan 
in certain cash logistics operations  title to the cash we receive and process transfers to us for a short period of time but is then generally credited to customers accounts the following day 
we do not consider this cash as available for general corporate purposes 
the increase in amounts owed to customers for these cash processing operations contributed million to t he increase in operating cash flows 
excluding the effect of the pension contribution  income tax payments and the increase in customer obligations  operating cash flows declined by million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the use of cash flows for working capital needs 
the decrease in cash flows provided by discontinued operations resulted from the receipt of million federal black lung excise tax cash refunds in compared to an million payment for a legal claim associated with bax global  a former business unit 
we have insurance coverage applicable to this matter and collected million from insurance companies in the third quarter of we believe that we will recover the bax global related legal claim payment less amounts paid by the insurance providers to litigate the matter 
operating cash flows decreased by million in as cash flows from both our continuing and discontinued operations were lower compared to the decrease in operating cash flows from continuing operations was mainly due to the third quarter contribution to our primary us pension plan  of which million was made in cash 
while not affecting our cash flow  we also contributed million in brink s stock to our pension  for a total contribution of million to the plan 
the pension contribution cash outflow was partially offset by million in income tax refunds  much of which were primarily the result of tax deductions associated with the cash and stock contribution to the pension plan 
lower operating profit in also had a negative effect on cash flows from operatio ns although we used less cash for working capital needs 
the decrease in operating cash flows related to discontinued operations was primarily due to bhs cash flows in exceeding fblet cash refunds  the primary source of operating cash flows from discontinued operations in investing activities cash flows from investing activities decreased by million in primarily due to a million increase in cash used to acquire businesses  partially offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures as a result of an increase in the use of capital leases to acquire armored vehicles and compusafe units in north america 
cash flows from investing activities used million less cash in versus primarily due to the spin off of bhs in bhs used million in primarily for the installation of home security equipment for customers  and we contributed million to bhs at the date of the spin off 
our continuing operations used more cash for investing activities in compared to for business acquisitions and higher capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets 
capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization are as follows outlook years ended december  change in millions property and equipment acquired during the year capital expenditures international a north america a capital expenditures capital leases b international a north america a capital leases total international a north america a total outlook years ended december  change in millions depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization international a north america a depreciation and amortization a not provided 
b represents the amount of property and equipment acquired using capital leases 
since the assets are acquired without using cash  the amounts are not included in the consolidated cash flow statement 
amounts are provided here to assist in the comparison of assets acquired in the current year versus prior years 
capital expenditures in were primarily for new cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles  information technology and compusafe units 
capital expenditures in decreased mainly due to lower expenditures in our north america segment 
the decrease in our north america segment was mainly due to fewer purchases of armored vehicles and compusafe units  as we leased rather than purchased those assets 
capital expenditures in were slightly higher than the same period of capital expenditures in were primarily for new cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles  and information technology 
higher capital expenditures in our north america segment were partially offset by a decrease in our international segment 
the increase in our north america segment was mainly due to higher expenditures for armored vehicles  as we elected to buy rather than lease these vehicles  as well as increased spending on compusafe units 
the decrease in brink s international capital expenditures from the prior year period was due to lower spending overall  as well as the changes in currency exchange rates 
capital expenditures have exceeded depreciation and amortization in the last several years and this trend is expected to continue in the next several years as a result of growth in the infrastructure of our operations  including new branch facilities and leasehold improvements  growth in technology investments  and investment in the safety and security of our operations 
financing activities summary of financing activities years ended december  in millions cash provided used by financing activities borrowings and repayments short term debt long term revolving credit facilities other long term debt debt financing costs cash proceeds from sale leaseback repurchase shares of common stock of brink s dividends attributable to shareholders of brink s noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries proceeds and tax benefits related to stock compensation and other cash flows from financing activities in  our net borrowings were million as compared to net repayments in of million 
the increased borrowings resulted primarily from funding business acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
we also used million in early to settle share purchases initiated in december our operating liquidity needs are typically financed by cash from operations  short term debt and the revolving facility  described below 
in  venezuela began limiting conversions of bolivar fuertes to us dollars to  per legal entity per month 
as a result  we do not anticipate repatriation of cash from our venezuelan operations for the foreseeable future 
this may limit our ability to use funds earned in venezuela for general corporate purposes  including reducing our us debt 
at december   our venezuelan subsidiaries held million of cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars and million of cash denominated in bolivar fuertes 
dividends we paid dividends of per share in each of the four quarters of future dividends are dependent on our earnings  financial condition  shareholders equity levels  our cash flow and business requirements  as determined by the board of directors 
capitalization we use a combination of debt  leases and equity to capitalize our operations 
as of december   debt as a percentage of capitalization defined as total debt and shareholders equity was compared to at december  the increase resulted from higher debt of million which increased primarily from the funding of business acquisitions and share repurchases and the increased use of capital leases to acquire armored vehicles and compusafe units

the cash is generally credited to customers accounts the following day and we do not consider it as available for general corporate purposes in the management of our liquidity and capital resources and in our computation of net debt 
net debt is a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
we use net debt as a measure of our financial leverage 
we believe that investors also may find net debt to be helpful in evaluating our financial leverage 
net debt should not be considered as an alternative to debt determined in accordance with gaap and should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
set forth above is a reconciliation of net debt  a non gaap financial measure  to debt  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap  as of december   and december  at december   net debt was million excluding cash and debt in venezuelan operations 
net debt cash position changed primarily due to the decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance 
items that affected cash and cash equivalents during were acquisitions net of cash acquired million  and share repurchases million debt we have an unsecured million revolving bank credit facility the revolving facility with a syndicate of banks 
the revolving facility s interest rate is based on libor plus a margin  alternate base rate plus a margin  or competitive bid 
the revolving facility allows the company to borrow or issue letters of credit or otherwise satisfy credit needs on a revolving basis over a four year term ending in july as of december   million was available under the revolving facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december   were denominated primarily in us dollars and to a lesser extent in canadian dollars 
the margin on libor borrowings under the revolving facility  which can range from to depending on our credit rating  was at december  the margin on alternate base rate borrowings under the revolving facility can range from to 
we also pay an annual facility fee on the revolving facility based on our credit rating 
the facility fee  which can range from to  was at the end of we have two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities with a total of million in available credit  of which approximately million was available at december  a million facility expires in december and a million facility expires in december interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a margin 
the margin ranges from to 
we also have the ability to borrow from other banks  at the banks discretion  under short term uncommitted agreements 
various foreign subsidiaries maintain other lines of credit and overdraft facilities with a number of banks 
we have two unsecured letter of credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was available at december  a million facility expires in july and a million facility expires in december the revolving facility and the multi currency revolving credit facilities are also used for issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
we also have a bilateral committed credit facility the credit facility with a total of million in available credit that expires in march interest on this facility is based on libor plus a margin  which ranges from to 
as of december   million was available under the credit facility 
we expect to refinance facilities maturing in the revolving facility  the two letter of credit facilities  the two unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities and the credit facility contain subsidiary guarantees and various financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants  among other things  limit our total indebtedness  limit priority debt  limit asset sales  limit the use of proceeds from asset sales and provide for minimum coverage of interest costs 
the credit agreements do not provide for the acceleration of payments should our credit rating be reduced 
if we were not to comply with the terms of our various loan agreements  the repayment terms could be accelerated and the commitments could be withdrawn 
an acceleration of the repayment terms under one agreement could trigger the acceleration of the repayment terms under the other loan agreements 
in november  we obtained appropriate waivers in connection with the bankruptcy of our belgium subsidiary to ensure that we remain compliant with the terms of our facilities 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  we have million of bonds issued by the peninsula ports authority of virginia recorded as debt on our balance sheet 
although we are not the primary obligor of the debt  we have guaranteed the debt and we believe that we will ultimately pay this obligation 
the guarantee originated as part of a former interest in dominion terminal associates  a deep water coal terminal 
we continue to pay interest on the debt 
the bonds bear a fixed interest rate of and mature in the bonds may mature prior to upon the occurrence of specified events such as the determination that the bonds are taxable or if we fail to abide by the terms of the guarantee 
based on our current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit facilities and current projections of cash flows from operations  we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for more than the next months 
on january   we issued million in unsecured notes through a private placement debt transaction the notes 
the notes are comprised of million in series a notes with a fixed coupon rate of and million in series b notes with a fixed coupon rate of

employee benefits trust in september  we terminated the brink s company employee benefits trust the employee benefits trust 
immediately prior to termination  the shares held by the trust were distributed to us and the shares were retired 
the purpose of the employee benefits trust prior to termination was to hold shares of our common stock to fund obligations under compensation and employee benefit programs that provided for the issuance of stock 
after the termination of the trust  newly issued shares are used to satisfy these programs 
through  shares of common stock were voted by the trustee in the same proportion as the shares of common stock voted by our employees participating in our k plan 
our k plan divested all shares of our common stock in january after the k plan divested all shares of our common stock  shares of the trust were not voted in matters voted on by shareholders 
preferred stock at december   we had the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
we use operating leases to lower our cost of financings

contingent matters bankruptcy of brink s belgium background 
our cash in transit subsidiary in belgium brink s belgium filed for bankruptcy in november after a restructuring plan was rejected by local union employees and was placed into bankruptcy on february  we continue to operate our separate global services unit in belgium  which provides secure transport of diamonds  jewelry  precious metals  banknotes and other commodities 
deconsolidation 
brink s belgium continued to provide cash in transit services for customers after the bankruptcy filing for approximately three months under the management of a court appointed trustee 
we no longer control or provide funding for the subsidiary 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  consolidation  we deconsolidated the subsidiary in november  when the trustee assumed control of the subsidiary 
we estimated that the fair value of our investment at the date of deconsolidation was zero 
our carrying value of the investment and advances to the subsidiary at the date of the deconsolidation was million  which we wrote off as a result of the deconsolidation  resulting in a pretax l oss 
we also have incurred approximately million of other charges related to the bankruptcy of the subsidiary 
the losses related to deconsolidation and other charges have been recorded in operating income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
legal dispute 
in december  the court appointed provisional administrators of brink s belgium filed a claim for million against a subsidiary of brink s 
we do not believe that this claim has merit  and we are pursuing a vigorous defense to contest this action 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur a loss of up to million equivalent to million at december  if we lose in the court proceeding  but it is also reasonably possible that we will prevail in the court resulting in no loss 
we do not believe that any loss within this range is probable and have not accrued for this matter 
the ultimate resolution of this matter is unknown and the estimated liability may change in the f uture 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
other we are involved in various other lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to estimate the range of losses for some of these matters 
we have recorded accruals for losses that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
we make assumptions  estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
reported results could have been materially different had management used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
accounting policies we establish valuation allowances in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  when we estimate it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
we decide to record valuation allowances primarily based on an assessment of historical earnings and future taxable income that incorporates prudent  feasible tax planning strategies 
we assess deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
changes in tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance could result in material adjustments to our valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense 
our valuation allowances are as follows 
valuation allowances december  in millions us non us total application of accounting policies us deferred tax assets there were no significant changes to our deferred tax assets and valuation allowances in our deferred tax assets  before valuation allowances  decreased in as a result of an increase in retirement asset values from the equity market improvement and our contribution to the primary us pension plan 
the likelihood of realizing additional amounts of the remaining deferred tax assets improved due to improving market conditions  including credit markets 
as a result  we revised our estimate of the amount of us valuation allowances needed and reversed million in income from continuing operations 
we used various estimates and assumptions to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in the us these included projected revenues and operating income for our us entities  estimated required contributions to our us retirement plans  and interest rates on projected us borrowings 
had we used different assumptions  we might have made different conclusions about the need for valuation allowances 
for example  using different assumptions in we might have concluded that we require a valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax assets at the end of further  in we might have concluded that we should keep the valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax asset  or we might have concluded that we should have reversed less than we did 
in that case  our tax provision on income from continuing operations could have been up to million higher in non us deferred tax assets we changed our judgment about the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain non us jurisdictions as a result of improvements in operating results and an improved outlook about the future operating performance 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowances in and million of valuation allowances in through continuing operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   we had property and equipment of million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we review these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  for goodwill and other intangible assets and fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment  for property and equipment 
our review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of our operating subsidiaries 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimates of the fair value of these assets  differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the impairment analyses 
application of accounting policies goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if impairment is indicated 
due to a history of profitability and cash flow generation along with expectations for future cash flows  fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value 
indefinite lived intangibles we review indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
an indefinite lived intangible is also evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to its estimated fair value 
no impairment testing was performed during the year for indefinite lived intangibles acquired in the fourth quarter as no indicators of impairment existed in the short time from acquisition date to year end 
other intangible assets and property and equipment we review long lived assets besides goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether impairment has occurred  we compare estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value 
we have had no significant impairments of property and equipment in the last three years 
retirement and postemployment benefit obligations we provide benefits through defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements 
accounting policy we account for pension and other retirement benefit obligations under fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
we account for postemployment benefit obligations  including workers compensation obligations  under fasb asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
to account for these benefits  we make assumptions of expected return on assets  discount rates  inflation  demographic factors and changes in the laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on our liabilities and expenses related to these benefits 
our most significant retirement plans include our primary us pension plan and the retiree medical plans of our former coal business that were collectively bargained with the united mine workers of america the umwa 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
application of accounting policy discount rate assumptions for plans accounted under fasb asc topic for plans accounted under fasb asc topic  we discount estimated future payments using discount rates based on market conditions at the end of the year 
in general  our liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates 
that is  the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
we derive the discount rates used to measure the present value of our benefit obligations using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  we compare the plan s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on the mercer yield curve 
each year s projected cash flows are then discounted back to their present value at the measurement date and an overall discount rate is determined 
the overall discount rate is then rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
the discount rates for the us pension plans  umwa retiree medical plans and black lung obligations were primary us plan umwa plans black lung discount rate retirement cost benefit obligation at year end sensitivity analysis the discount rate we select at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations for our largest plans as of december   actual expenses for and projected expenses for assuming we had used discount rates that were one percentage point lower or higher 
plan obligations at december  hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions primary us pension plan umwa plans actual and projected expense income in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption hypothetical sensitivity analysis for discount rate assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  primary us pension plan discount rate assumption retirement cost credit umwa plans discount rate assumption retirement cost expected return on assets assumption for plans accounted under fasb asc topic our expected return on assets assumption  which affects our net periodic benefit cost  reflects the long term average rate of return we expect the plan assets to earn 
we select the expected return on assets assumption using advice from our investment advisor and actuary considering each plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of the most recent long term historical average compounded rates of return  as applicable 
we selected as the expected return on assets assumption as of december  and over the last ten years  the annual returns of our primary us pension plan have averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  while the year and year compounded annual return averaged  and the year compounded annual return averaged 
sensitivity analysis effect of using different expected rate of return assumptions 
our and projected expense would have been different if we had used different expected rate of return assumptions 
for every hypothetical change of one percentage point in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and holding other assumptions constant  our and expense would be as follows

in millions  except percentages hypothetical sensitivity analysis of asset return better or worse than expected better worse years ending december  projected return return return on investments in funded status at december  primary us pension plan umwa plans expense primary us pension plan a umwa plans effect of using fair market value of assets to determine expense 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
in addition  our plan asset actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization are based on the market related value 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is  at a point in time  the value of the assets that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value from the expected value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
our expenses related to our primary us pension plan would have been different if our accounting policy were to use the fair market value of plan assets instead of the market related value to recognize investment gains and losses 
in millions based on market related value of assets hypothetical a actual projected projected years ending december  expense income primary us pension plan a assumes that our accounting policy was to use the fair market value of assets instead of the market related value of assets to determine our expense relatedto our primary us pension plan 
for our umwa plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at the beginning of the year 
this method is likely to cause the expected return on assets  which is recorded in earnings  to fluctuate more than had we used the accounting methodology of our defined benefit pension plans 
medical inflation assumption we estimate the trend in health care cost inflation to predict future cash flows related to our retiree medical plans 
our assumption is based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
for the umwa plans  our largest postretirement plans  we have assumed a medical inflation rate of for  and we project this rate to decline to by the compound growth rate of per capita health care costs of the umwa plans has been over the last seven years 
if we had assumed that medical inflation rates were one percentage point higher in each future year  the plan obligation for these plans at december   would have been approximately million higher and the expense for would have been million higher 
if we had assumed that the medical inflation rates were one percentage point lower  the plan obligation at december   would have been approximately million lower and the related expenses would have been million lower 
if we had projected medical inflation rates to ratably decline from to by  instead of ratably declining to by as we estimated  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been million higher for and our expense would be million higher for in addition  the patient protection and affordable care act could substantially change the health care and insurance industries in the united states  which could increase our costs 
black lung the patient protection and affordable care act  which was enacted in march  contains an amendment to the laws governing federal black lung benefits for coal miners 
the amendment creates a presumption that benefits should be awarded to current or former coal miners that have accumulated or more years of coal mine employment if they are able to prove that they have a disabling pulmonary disease 
previously  miners were required to demonstrate that their disabling pulmonary disease was caused by black lung disease  and not by some other cause such as smoking or old age 
under the new law  the burden of proof becomes the employer s to establish that the disabling pulmonary disease is not black lung disease or that t he miner s disease did not result from coal mine employment 
surviving spouses will no longer be required to prove that black lung disease caused the death of a miner to continue receiving benefits 
the new law will be used to assess claims that are currently being reviewed  unless the claim was filed before january  miners who have been denied benefits in the past either as a result of not being able to prove that they have a disabling pulmonary disease  or not being able to prove that their disease was black lung disease may reapply for benefits and these claims will be assessed using the new rules 
the amendment will likely increase the approval rates for coal miners applying to receive black lung benefits  therefore we expect the number of participants receiving black lung benefits may increase over the next few years 
we remeasured our black lung obligation as of march   to reflect an estimate of the increase in amounts to be paid to miners as a result of the new law 
the obligation increased million as a result of the remeasurement  from million before the remeasurement to million 
approval rates used in the remeasurement of the black lung obligation were increased to reflect an estimate of the effect of the new legislation 
approval rates are difficult to estimate since the effect of the change in the law has not yet been observed in practice 
the liability could change in the future if the approval rates used in the estimates of the liabilities are either too high or too low 
these estimated amounts will change in the future to reflect payments made  actuarial revaluations  and other changes in estimates 
actual amounts could differ materially from the currently estimated amounts 
workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
our liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of an actuary 
numbers of participants the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  we rely on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
we use the following mortality table for our major plans 
plan mortality table umwa plans rp employee  annuitant healthy blue collar black lung rp blue collar primary us pension rp combined healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan in the past five years is as follows number of participants plan umwa plans black lung us pension since we are no longer operating in the coal industry  we anticipate that the number of participants in the umwa retirement medical plan will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants should also decline over time 
foreign currency translation the majority of our subsidiaries outside the us conduct business in their local currencies 
our financials report results in us dollars  which include the results of these subsidiaries 
accounting policy our accounting policy for foreign currency translation is different depending on whether the economy in which our foreign subsidiary operates has been designated as highly inflationary or not 
economies with a three year cumulative inflation rate of more than are considered as highly inflationary 
at the end of  we did not have any subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
effective january   we began accounting for our venezuelan subsidiaries as operating in a highly inflationary economy 
non highly inflationary economies assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in non highly inflationary economies are translated into us dollars using rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in effect during the year 
transaction gains and losses are recorded in net income 
highly inflationary economies foreign subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary countries must use the reporting currency the us dollar as the functional currency 
local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into dollars each balance sheet date  with remeasurement adjustments and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 
non monetary assets and liabilities do not fluctuate with changes in local currency exchange rates to the dollar 
application of accounting policy venezuelan operations our venezuelan operations constitute a material portion of our overall consolidated operations  and accounted for million or of total brink s revenues in our operating margins in venezuela have varied depending on the mix of business during any year and have been up to three times our overall international segment operating margin rate 
venezuela currency exchange rates since  the venezuelan government has controlled the exchange of local currency into other currencies  including the us dollar 
from to the present the government has maintained an official exchange rate 
the rate is available only for transactions that have been approved by the government s currency control agency  known as cadivi  or if the purpose of the conversion is to purchase goods or services that are on a list of approved items 
the official rate was bolivar fuertes to the dollar in and in january  the official currency was devalued and split into two separate official rates  one for priority items such as food  and another rate for other imports and other purposes 
the ability to exchange funds at either of these rates requires cadivi s approval  unless the purpose of the conversion is to purchase goods or services that are on lists of approved items 
the new rates were and bolivar fuertes to the dollar 
in addition to the official rate  a parallel market exchange rate was available until a june law disallowed the use of the parallel rate 
prior to june  the parallel rate could be used to convert local cash into dollars 
the average parallel bolivar fuerte to dollar rate was in  in and in the first five months of the june law also introduced a new government sanctioned process to convert local currency into dollars at a rate known as the sitme rate 
the sitme exchange process requires each transaction be approved by the government s central bank 
on a daily basis  the central bank publishes ranges of prices at which it may approve transactions to purchase dollar denominated bonds  resulting in an exchange rate range of to bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
to date  approved transactions have been at the upper end of the range 
currency exchanges using the sitme rate may not exceed  per legal entity per month 
translating our venezuelan operations in our consolidated results and prior to december   we had requested cadivi s approval to allow our dividends be converted to dollars using the official rate 
as a result  we used the official rate to translate our venezuelan financial information 
this is consistent with the guidance issued by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality the iptf and us gaap 
this guidance provides that  in the absence of unusual circumstances  the rate used for dividend remittances should be used to translate foreign financial statements 
in december  we repatriated dividends generated by our venezuelan operations that had been unpaid over the last several years using the parallel market exchange rate 
we decided to repatriate our dividends using the parallel rate due to significant delays in receiving the needed government approval to repatriate dividends at the official rate 
we began translating our financial statements for our venezuelan operations using the parallel rate  effective december   the date of our decision  since we expected to pay future dividends using the parallel rate 
we recognized foreign currency translation losses in other comprehensive income loss in as a result of translating at the parallel rate instead of the official rate on december  losses recorded were million attributable to brink s million attributable to noncontrolling interests  and million in total 
effective january   we began accounting for venezuelan subsidiaries as operating in a highly inflationary economy 
we remeasured our bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets and translated our earnings and cash flows at the parallel rate in until it was disallowed and replaced by the sitme rate in june to the extent our venezuelan subsidiaries need to obtain us dollars  we currently expect our venezuelan subsidiaries us dollar denominated transactions to be settled at a sitme rate of bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
we also used this rate to remeasure our local currency denominated net monetary assets and translated our earnings and cash flows into us dollars beginning in june we recognized a million net remeasurement loss in despite the limitations on the amount of local currency which may be converted to dollars under the current law  we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient us dollars to purchase imported supplies and fixed assets to operate our business in venezuela 
we believe the new law will limit the repatriation of cash invested in venezuela for the foreseeable future 
the investment in our venezuelan subsidiaries  and cash and other monetary assets held by these subsidiaries are as follows december  in millions equity method investment in venezuelan subsidiaries a net monetary assets held by our venezuelan subsidiaries cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  accounts payable and other  net total a the amount represents retained earnings net of currency translation adjustments of the business

the qualitative analysis is based on identifying the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the vie s economic performance the power criterion and the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could po tentially be significant to the vie the losses benefit criterion 
the party that meets both these criteria is deemed to have a controlling financial interest 
the party with the controlling financial interest is considered to be the primary beneficiary and as a result is required to consolidate the vie 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu both expands and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements

additionally  entities are required to disclose information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the new guidance also clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
we adopted the new disclosures effective january   except for the level rollforward disclosures 
the level rollforward disclosures will be effective for us january  the adoption of the asu did not have a material effect on our disclosures as we did not have any significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair valu e valuation hierarchy in we adopted the accounting principles established by asu  subsequent events amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  effective january  under this amended guidance  sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements

the asu also expands the disclosures required upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary to disclo se the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of any retained investment in the former subsidiary  the nature of continuing involvement after the former subsidiary has been deconsolidated or derecognized and whether the transaction resulting in deconsolidation was with a related party or if the deconsolidated entity will become a related party 
finally  the asu also requires that entities disclose valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of previously held equity interests prior to acquiring control in a business combination achieved in stages

in may  the fasb issued asu  foreign currency issues multiple foreign currency exchange rates  which codified an sec staff announcement made at the march   emerging issues task force eitf meeting 
the staff announcement provides the sec staff s view on certain exchange rates related to investments in venezuela 
the use of different rates for remeasurement and translation purposes causes venezuelan reported balances for financial reporting purposes and the actual us dollar denominated balances to be different 
the sec staff indicated that any differences between the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes and actual us dollar denominated balances that may have existed prior to the application o f the highly inflationary accounting requirements january   for calendar year end registrants including brink s should be recognized in the income statement  unless the issuer can document that the difference was previously recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment  in which case the difference should be recognized as a currency translation adjustment 
we adopted the guidance effective march    and recognized these differences as a currency translation adjustment as of january   upon the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in venezuela

we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the amended guidance on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
these operations expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
we periodically use various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge our interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
we do not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance our operations 
floating rate obligations  including our revolving facility  expose us to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including our dominion terminal associates debt  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  our weighted average interest rate on our floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair value of our dominion terminal associates debt for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase in the fair value of this debt 
foreign currency risk we have exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of our foreign operations 
our foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
we are exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  we  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no material foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which we have continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease effect on earnings translation of earnings into us dollars transaction gains losses effect on other comprehensive income loss translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated effect attributable to brink s of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u

dollar 
the foreign currency exposure effect related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different 
venezuela designated as highly inflationary economy in the economy in venezuela has had significant inflation in the last several years 
in december  the three year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 
as a result  beginning january   we designated venezuela s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes  and we consolidated our venezuelan results using our accounting policy for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies
