business overview we are a premier intellectual property and technology licensing company 
our primary focus is the creation  design  development and licensing of patented innovations  technologies and architectures that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products and systems 
our patented innovations and technologies aim to improve the performance  power efficiency  time to market and cost effectiveness of our customers products  components and systems offered and used in semiconductors  computers  mobile applications  gaming and graphics  consumer electronics  lighting displays and general lighting 
by licensing our patented innovations and technologies  we hope to continuously enrich the end user experience of the digital electronics products and systems marketed and sold by our customers and licensees 
we believe we have established an unparalleled licensing platform and business model that will continue to foster the development of new foundational and leading innovations and technologies 
as a result  our goal is to create significant licensing opportunities  and thereby perpetuate strong company operating performance and long term stockholder value 
while we have historically focused our efforts in developing and licensing patented innovations and technologies for the semiconductor industry  particularly in the area of chip interfaces  we have initiated diversification efforts to expand our portfolio of patented innovations and technologies into lighting and displays  mobile communications  and additional semiconductor technologies 
we expect to continue this diversification initiative through the acquisition of assets and the hiring of the inventors  scientists and engineers who will lead the effort to further develop these patented innovations and technologies in these new areas of focus 
during  we initiated an internal structural reorganization to establish separate business groups for our semiconductor industry focused operations sbg and operations focused on new or emerging licensing opportunities nbg which includes our ldt group 
we expect this internal realignment to help drive efficiencies in operations and optimize our licensing platform and business model as we expand and diversify into new markets 
segment information is not separately 
table of contents discussed below as the operating results for nbg did not meet the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting in for additional information concerning segment reporting  see note  business segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows innovate develop and patent our innovative technology to provide fundamental competitive advantage when incorporated into semiconductors  and digital electronics products and systems 
drive adoption communicate the advantages of our patented innovations and technologies to the industry and encourage its adoption through demonstrations and incorporation in the products of select customers 
monetize license our patented inventions and technology solutions to customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
as of december   our semiconductor  chip interface  lighting  display and other technologies are covered by approximately  us and foreign patents 
additionally  we have approximately patent applications pending 
these patents and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  optoelectronics  mobile applications and other technologies 
some of the patents and pending patent applications are derived from a common parent patent application or are foreign counterpart patent applications 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate and would further our overall strategy and objectives 
in some instances  obtaining appropriate levels of protection may involve prosecuting continuation and counterpart patent applications based on a common parent application 
we believe that our patented innovations provide our customers means to achieve higher performance  improved power efficiency  lower risk  and greater cost effectiveness in their digital electronics products and systems 
our patented innovations and technologies are offered to our customers through either a patent license or a technology license 
our revenues are primarily derived from patent licenses  through which we provide a license to our broad portfolio of patented innovations primarily to semiconductor and system companies who use these innovations in the development and manufacture of their own products 
our patent licensing agreements may provide a license to all or part of our patent portfolio for a particular use  product or technology 
the patent license essentially provides our customers with a defined right to use our patented innovations in the customer s own digital electronics products and systems 
patent license agreements are generally structured with variable royalty payments  although some agreements include fixed payments over certain defined periods 
we also offer our customers technology licenses 
we typically offer technology licenses to support the implementation and adoption of our patented innovations and technologies through know how and technology transfers  product design  development  and system integration consulting and engineering services 
our technology license offerings also include a range of solutions developed by rambus  which include leadership solutions which are rambus proprietary solutions widely licensed to our customers and industry standard solutions that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into our customers digital electronics products and systems 
due to the often complex nature of implementing state of the art technology  we also offer engineering services to our customers to help them successfully integrate our solutions into their digital electronics products and systems 
these technology license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
engineering services are generally offered on a fixed price basis 
further  under technology licenses  our customers typically receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement these solutions in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts with us 
royalties represent a substantial majority of our total revenue 
we derive the majority of our royalty revenue by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
such licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  fujitsu  intel  panasonic and samsung have licensed our patents for use in their own products 
we also derive additional revenue by licensing a range of technology solutions including our leadership architectures and industry standard solutions to customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
our 
table of contents customers include leading companies such as elpida  ibm  panasonic  samsung  sony and toshiba 
due to the complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses to help our customers successfully integrate our technology solutions into their semiconductors and system products 
licensees also may receive  in addition to their technology license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the technology in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
the remainder of our revenue is contract services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or account receivables in any given period 
we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenue in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenue or expenses change 
executive summary during  we signed a significant settlement agreement with samsung and also signed revenue contracts with amd  elpida and renesas bringing rambus into a profit position for the year ended december  see note  settlement agreement with samsung  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
we continue to pursue other revenue opportunities in order to grow our revenue 
additionally  in june  we signed a broad licensing agreement for the use of our patented lighting innovations with ge lighting  a unit of ge s appliances lighting business 
we also purchased patents and businesses during as part of our ongoing acquisition activities to broaden our technology portfolio 
research and development continues to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations 
our engineering expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to primarily due to increased headcount from our ldt group and the funding for our corporate incentive plan the cip which includes the bonus related to the samsung settlement 
as a percentage of revenue  engineering expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was due to higher revenue primarily attributed to the settlement with samsung 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in aggregate decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to lower litigation expenses 
our higher revenue combined with the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses  has caused marketing  general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
additionally  for the year ended december   we incurred costs of restatement and related legal activities of million primarily due to litigation expense associated with a private shareholder lawsuit related to the stock option investigation 
trends there are a number of trends that may or will have a material impact on us in the future  including growing our lighting business  global economic conditions with the resulting impact on sales  continuing pursuit of litigation against companies that we believe have infringed our patented technologies and shifts in our overall effective tax rate 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of our settlement with samsung  samsung accounted for a significant portion of our ongoing licensing revenue in for the year ended december   revenue from samsung and elpida  each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from amd  fujitsu  nec  panasonic  and toshiba  each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from amd  elpida  fujitsu  nec  panasonic  and sony  each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
we expect to continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 

table of contents many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  renewals of existing contracts  industry consolidation and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
our visibility with respect to future sales is very limited at this time 
to the extent that macroeconomic fluctuations negatively affect our principal licensees  the demand for our technology may be significantly and adversely impacted and we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
the recent downturn in worldwide economic conditions also threatens the financial health of our commercial counterparties  including companies with whom we have entered into licensing arrangements  settlement agreements or that have been subject to litigation judgments that provide for payments to us  and their ability to fulfill their financial and other obligations to us 
some of our existing patent licensees have fixed royalty payments which are not impacted by the recent economic downturn 
royalty payments from the remaining licensees are related to variable royalty agreements which have been impacted by the recent economic conditions 
current market indicators are mixed  but there are some recent signs of some stabilization 
however  there continue to be indications that global demand will not quickly recover for the next few years 
such lower demand levels may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
see item a  risk factors 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenue that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our chip interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
see item a  risk factors 
the display industry is also intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
we believe the potential percentage of transition to led lightguides from cold cathode fluorescent lights ccfl lightguides could be up to for cellular phones and notebook computers and could reach up to for display monitors and lcd televisions in the tablet market is growing rapidly as a new category that primarily uses led lightguides to achieve slim designs 
our ldt group has numerous patents in edge lit led lightguide technology 
our plans are to license our technology to key companies that use led edge lit display products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain licensees for our led edge lit technology 
additionally  there are competing technologies  such as the active matrix organic light emitting diode  that do not use led edge lit lightguides which may limit the future market opportunity for our technology 
the highly fragmented general lighting industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from incandescent technology to ccfl and led driven technology by the need to reduce energy consumption and to comply with government mandates 
led lighting typically saves of the energy costs as compared to existing installed lighting 
our ldt group has numerous patents in led edge lit lightguide technology which can be applied in the design of next generation led lighting products 
while our goal is to be a major player in the general lighting industry with our technology and have established a technology center in brecksville  ohio  there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
the market adoption of our technology may face delays in design  government mandates in specification  material shortages and manufacturing delays within the supply base and in overall market acceptance 
additionally  there are competing design approaches and technologies  such as organic light emitting diode  that may also affect our ability to obtain additional licensees 
our revenue from companies headquartered outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect 
table of contents that revenue derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to their customers are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenue  see note  business segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
engineering costs as a percentage of net sales decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
in the near term  we expect engineering costs to be lower than in as the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement was a one time event in however  we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovations in semiconductor and lighting technologies and  as a result  our head count and infrastructure expenses are expected to increase 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the aggregate and as a percentage of net sales decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
historically  we have been involved in litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict and future litigation expenses could be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue may not grow or may decrease 
furthermore  our success in litigation matters pending before courts and regulatory bodies that relate to our intellectual property rights have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability and the terms upon which we are able to negotiate new or renegotiate existing licenses for our technology 
we will continue to pursue litigation against those companies that have infringed our patented technologies  which in turn will continue to increase marketing  general and administrative expenses as litigation expenses will continue to increase until such litigation is resolved 
as we continue to pursue litigation and invest in research and development projects and if we experience lower revenue from our licensees in the future  our cash from operations will be negatively affected 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative costs recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net gain from settlement restructuring costs impairment of intangible asset total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income and other income  net interest expense on convertible notes interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss includes stock based compensation cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions total revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue royalty revenue patent licenses our patent royalties increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the revenue recognized from the agreements signed with samsung and elpida during 
table of contents our patent royalties decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the elpida licensing agreement in the first quarter of  the one time receipt of previously withheld royalties from the federal trade commission ftc disposition order in and lower variable patent royalty payments received in  as a result of  among other things  lower product shipment volumes reported by customers 
in march  amd elected to exercise its right to renew the rambus amd patent license agreement through the third quarter of the original term of amd s agreement ran through the end of september in december  elpida renewed its patent license agreement 
the effective date of the agreement is january  and the expiration date of the term license is january  in december  renesas renewed its patent license agreement 
the effective date of the agreement is april  and the expiration date of the term license is april  we are in negotiations with prospective licensees as well as existing licensees regarding renewals 
we expect patent royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
technology licenses royalties from technology licenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to higher royalties reported from increased shipments related to ddr technologies and higher royalties from xdr tm dram associated with increased shipments of the sony playstation product  partially offset by lower royalties from rdram tm controllers in the first half of due to a one time catch up royalty payment for the sony playstation product in the second quarter of royalties from technology licenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to higher royalties reported from increased shipments related to ddr technologies and a one time catch up royalty payment in the second quarter of related to rdram tm controllers associated with shipments of the sony playstation product  offset by decreased royalties from xdr tm dram associated with decreased shipments of the sony playstation product 
in the future  we expect technology royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
contract revenue contract revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to fewer new technology development contracts and decrease in work performed on existing technology development contracts 
contract revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to fewer new technology development contracts  decrease in work performed on existing technology development contracts  as well as decreased revenue from reseller arrangements 
we believe that contract revenue recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  the timing of completing engineering deliverables  and by changes to work required  as well as new technology development contracts booked in the future 

table of contents engineering costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions engineering costs cost of revenue stock based compensation total cost of revenue research and development stock based compensation total research and development total engineering costs engineering costs are allocated between cost of revenue and research and development expenses 
cost of revenue reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual licensee development and support services as well as amortization expense related to various acquired intellectual property for patent licensing 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of generally applicable chip interface technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual licensee contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs increased primarily due to the increase in headcount from our ldt group and the funding for our cip  which includes the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement  increase in patent research related costs and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from glt 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs decreased primarily due to lower headcount and the related decrease in salary  benefits  allocations and stock based compensation expenses as well as decreases in consulting and travel and entertainment costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives that commenced in the second half of in the near term  we expect engineering costs to be lower than in as the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement was a one time event in however  we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovation in semiconductor and lighting technologies and  as a result  our headcount and infrastructure costs are expected to increase 
marketing  general and administrative costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense stock based compensation total marketing  general and administrative costs 
table of contents marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  litigation  general legal  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  our licensing and marketing activities aim to develop or strengthen relationships with potential and current licensees 
in addition  we work with current licensees through marketing  sales and technical efforts to drive adoption of their products  that use our innovations and solutions  by system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenue in that period or in recent or future periods 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs decreased primarily due to lower litigation expenses 
non litigation related marketing  general and administrative costs increased for the year ended december  primarily due to funding for our cip  which includes the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement  increased consulting fees  increased general legal expenses and increased headcount in corporate development commencing in as a result of our strategic initiatives to identify and acquire additional technology opportunities 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs were higher due primarily to ongoing patent acquisition activities in  higher headcount in corporate development as a result of our strategic initiatives related to our investing activities  increased stock based compensation expenses primarily related to nonvested equity awards granted during late and early  and higher allocated costs 
these increases were offset by decreases in depreciation expenses  rent and facilities expenses and overall marketing expenses due primarily to our cost reduction initiatives taken in litigation expenses remained relatively flat from to as we continued to pursue litigation against those companies that have infringed on our patented technologies 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative costs will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal  acquisition and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the variability of litigation activities 
costs recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions costs recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net nm nm nm percentage is not meaningful as the change is too large costs recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net  consist primarily of investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation and the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation 
for the year ended december   costs of restatement and related legal activities  net  were million primarily due to litigation expense associated with a private shareholder lawsuit related to the stock option investigation 
in  we recorded reimbursements of million from the insurance carriers and received million from former executives as part of their settlement agreements with us in connection with the derivative and class action lawsuits in for the year ended december   recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net  were million due primarily to recognition of insurance settlements of million from the insurance carriers and the receipt of million from former executives as part of their settlement agreements with us in connection with the derivative and class action lawsuits 
the million was recorded as recoveries of restatement and related legal activities 
until all the litigation and related issues are resolved  we anticipate that there could be additional amounts relating to these matters in the future 

table of contents gain from settlement years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions gain from settlement n a n a n a not applicable the settlement with samsung is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes 
for a multiple element arrangement  we are required to determine the fair value of the elements 
we considered several factors in determining the accounting fair value of the elements of the settlement with samsung which included a third party valuation using an income approach  the black scholes option pricing model and a residual approach collectively the fair value 
the total gain from settlement is million of which million was recognized for the year ended december  the gain from settlement represents the fair value of the cash consideration allocated to the resolution of the antitrust litigation settlement and the residual value of other elements 
interest and other income expense  net years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions interest income and other income  net interest expense on convertible notes interest and other income expense  net nm nm percentage is not meaningful as the change is too large interest income and other income  net  consists primarily of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities  offset by interest expense in connection with our imputed facility lease obligations 
following the substantial completion of construction in the fourth quarter of  we occupied our sunnyvale and brecksville facilities 
in connection with the application of fasb authoritative guidance to our leases of the new facilities  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings  and therefore the estimated fair value of our portion of the buildings is required to be capitalized on our books as a non cash transaction  offset by a corresponding imputed financing obligation on our balance sheet 
the imputed financing obligations are amortized using the effective interest method with the imputed interest rate of approximately 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of interest expense in connection with the imputed financing obligations in our statement of operations 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional details 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in interest income and other income  net  was primarily due to lower yields on invested balances 
interest expense on convertible notes consists of non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on the zero coupon convertible senior notes due february  the notes and the notes as well as the coupon interest related to the notes 
we expect interest expense to increase steadily as the notes reach maturity 
see note convertible notes  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional details 

table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions provision for benefit from income taxes nm nm effective tax rate nm percentage is not meaningful as the change is too large our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is lower than the us statutory tax rate applied to our pretax income due to a reduction of the valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets  foreign withholding taxes and certain foreign losses with no current tax benefit recorded 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us statutory tax rate applied to our pretax loss primarily due to a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets  foreign income taxes and state income taxes  partially offset by refundable research and development tax credits and carryback of net operating loss 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us statutory tax rate applied to our pretax loss primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
based on all available evidence  we determined that it was not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
should we achieve sustained taxable income in the future  we would release the valuation allowance to recognize the deferred tax assets consisting of future tax deductions  net operating loss and credit carryforwards which provide a valuable benefit to us 
restructuring costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions restructuring costs n a n a n a not applicable during the years ended december  and  we did not incur any costs associated with restructuring activities 
during the year ended december   we initiated a workforce reduction in certain areas of excess capacity 
the cash severance  including continuance of certain employee benefits  totaled approximately million and non cash employee severance was approximately million of stock based compensation expense 
we also leased a facility in mountain view  california  through november   which we vacated during the fourth quarter of as a result of the restructuring measures 
this facility was being subleased at a rate equal to our rent associated with the facility and  as a result no restructuring charge was recorded 
the total restructuring charge for the year ended december  was approximately million

cash needs for were funded primarily from operating activities due to the settlement with samsung as well as financing activities due to proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the stock purchase agreement with samsung and from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the signing of samsung and elpida 
in total  samsung and elpida provided approximately million of net operating cash flow after applicable foreign tax withholdings 
additionally cash provided by operating activities included increases in accrued salaries due to the cip and bonus related to the samsung settlement which was offset by decreases in accrued litigation and accounts payable 
cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss adjusted for certain non cash items including stock based compensation expense  non cash interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities which included decreases in accrued litigation expenses due to recognition of proceeds of million from an insurance company related to the derivative and class action lawsuits offset by increases in accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments 
cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss for the period adjusted for non cash items  including the tax provision related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  stock based compensation expense  non cash interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  impairment of an asset  offset by gain on repurchase of convertible notes and recoveries of restatement and related legal activities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in accrued litigation expenses due to payments related to the class action lawsuit settlement 
investing activities cash used in investing activities of approximately million in the year ended december  primarily consisted of purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million  partially offset by 
table of contents proceeds from the maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million 
we also purchased patents and businesses for an aggregate price of approximately million 
additionally  we paid million for the build out of the facilities in sunnyvale  california and brecksville  ohio as well as to acquire computer software  computer hardware and machinery and equipment 
cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in the year ended december  primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million 
in december  we paid million in a business combination to acquire technology and a portfolio of advanced lighting and optoelectronics patents from glt 
additionally  we paid million to acquire property  plant and equipment  primarily computer software  and million for intangible assets 
we also made a million investment in a non marketable equity security of a technology company 
cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in the year ended december  primarily consisted of proceeds from the maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million and proceeds from sale of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale marketable securities of million 
additionally  we paid million to acquire property and equipment  primarily computer equipment and computer software licenses 
financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  was primarily due to the payment upon maturity of million in face value of notes and stock repurchased with an aggregate price of million under our share repurchase program  which includes the shares purchased under share repurchase agreement with jp morgan  offset by proceeds received of million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the stock purchase agreement with samsung

additionally  we repurchased approximately million in face value of our zero coupon convertible senior notes for million 
we also received approximately million from the issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans 
in addition  we paid million under installment payment plans used to acquire software license agreements 
we currently anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months  including any cash needs to purchase the shares of contingently redeemable common stock that may be put back to us by samsung in in february  we satisfied our requirement to pay the notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or investment fair value fluctuations 
we have the ability to hold and we believe that we can recover the amortized cost of our investments 
there is no evidence of impairment due to credit losses in our portfolio 
we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit risk exposures in accordance with our policies 
we may also incur additional expenditures related to future potential restructuring activities 
as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and this annual report on form k  we are involved in ongoing litigation related to our intellectual property and our past stock option investigation

table of contents contractual obligations on december   we entered into a definitive triple net space lease agreement with mt spe  llc the landlord whereby we lease approximately  square feet of office space located at enterprise way in sunnyvale  california the sunnyvale lease 
the office space is used for our corporate headquarters  as well as engineering  marketing and administrative operations and activities 
we moved to the new premises in the fourth quarter of following substantial completion of leasehold improvements 
the sunnyvale lease has a term of months from the commencement date 
the initial annual base rent is million  subject to a full abatement of rent for the first six months of the sunnyvale lease term  but with the rent for the seventh month paid in december in order to gain access to the building 
the annual base rent increases each year to certain fixed amounts over the course of the term as set forth in the sunnyvale lease and will be million in the tenth year 
in addition to the base rent  we also pay operating expenses  insurance expenses  real estate taxes and a management fee 
we have two options to extend the sunnyvale lease for a period of months each and a one time option to terminate the sunnyvale lease after months in exchange for an early termination fee 
since certain improvements we constructed are considered structural in nature and we are responsible for any cost overruns  for accounting purposes  we are treated in substance as the owner of the construction project during the construction period 
accordingly  as of december   we have capitalized million in property  plant and equipment based on the estimated fair value of the portion of the unfinished building along with a corresponding imputed financing obligation for the same amount 
the fair value was determined as of december  using level fair value inputs defined as prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable ie  supported by little or no market activity and the cost approach which measures the value of an asset as the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another asset of like utility 
following substantial completion of construction in the fourth quarter of  we occupied the building 
at completion  we concluded that we retained sufficient continuing involvement to preclude de recognition of the building under the fasb authoritative guidance applicable to the sale leasebacks of real estate 
as such  we continue to account for the building as owned real estate and to record an imputed financing obligation for our obligation to the legal owner 
in addition  we capitalized million of interest on the building with a corresponding imputed financing obligation for the same amount 
pursuant to the terms of the sunnyvale lease  the landlord has agreed to reimburse us approximately million  of which million was received in we expect the remaining million to be received in we recognized the million reimbursement as additional imputed financing obligation under the fasb authoritative guidance as such payment from the landlord is deemed to be an imputed financing obligation 
monthly lease payments on the facility are allocated between the land element of the lease which is accounted for as an operating lease and the imputed financing obligation 
the imputed financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method and the interest rate determined in accordance with the requirements of sale leaseback accounting 
for the year ended december   we recognized in its statement of operations million of interest expense in connection with the imputed financing obligation 
at december   the imputed financing obligation balance in connection with the new facility was million  of which million was classified under other accrued liabilities in the current liabilities section and million was classified under long term imputed financing obligation 
at the end of the initial ten year lease term  should we decide not to renew the lease  we would reverse the equal amounts of the net book value of the building and the corresponding imputed financing obligation 
on march   we entered into a lease agreement with fogg brecksville development co 
the ohio landlord for  square feet of space consisting of  square feet of office area and  square feet of warehouse area  located in brecksville  ohio the ohio lease 
we moved to the new premises at the end of the third quarter of following substantial completion of leasehold improvements 
the warehouse area was converted into office space and manufacturing space 
the office space is used for the ldt group s engineering activities while the manufacturing space is used for the manufacturer of prototypes for the ldt group 
the ohio lease has a term of months from the commencement date which is the earlier of i the date upon which we first take occupancy of the premises once the construction work is completed or ii the first day of the month following completion and notification by the lessor to us of completion of construction of the building 
the initial annual base 
table of contents rent is approximately  in addition to the base rent  we also pay operating expenses  insurance expenses  real estate taxes and a management fee 
we have an option to extend the ohio lease for an additional period of months

as such  we continue to account for the building as owned real estate and to record an imputed financing obligation for our obligation to the legal owner 
at the end of the lease term in  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional months 
as a result of the significant amount of construction costs  we currently would expect to renew the lease for an additional months so the lease term for accounting purposes will be the period of intended use of ten years 
the lease payments are recorded as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the lease and the building is depreciated on a straight line basis over a period of years 
for the year ended december   we recognized in our statement of operations thousand of interest expense in connection with the imputed financing obligation 
at december   the imputed financing obligation balance in connection with the new facility was million which was classified under long term imputed financing obligation 
at the end of the ten year intended use term  we would reverse the equal amounts of the net book value of the building and the corresponding imputed financing obligation

the 
table of contents above table does not reflect possible payments in connection with the contingently redeemable common stock discussed below 
we have commitments with various software vendors for non cancellable license agreements that generally have terms longer than one year 
the above table summarizes those contractual obligations as of december  which are also listed on our balance sheet under current and other long term liabilities 
contingently redeemable common stock on january   pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  samsung purchased for cash from us million shares of our common stock the shares with certain restrictions and put rights 
the issuance of the shares by us to samsung was made through a private transaction 
the stock purchase agreement provides samsung a one time put right  beginning months after the date of the stock purchase agreement and extending to months after the date of the stock purchase agreement  to elect to put back to us up to million of the shares at the original issue price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of up to million 
the million shares have been recorded as contingently redeemable common stock on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the stock purchase agreement prohibits the transfer of the shares by samsung for months after the date of the stock purchase agreement  subject to certain exceptions 
after expiration of the transfer restriction period on july   the stock purchase agreement provides that samsung may transfer a limited number of shares on a daily basis  provides us with a right of first offer for proposed transfers above such daily limits  and  if no sale occurs to us under the right of first offer  allows samsung to transfer the shares 
under the stock purchase agreement  we have also agreed that after the transfer restriction period  samsung will have certain rights to register the shares for sale under the securities laws of the united states  subject to customary terms and conditions

share repurchase program in october  the board approved a share repurchase program of our common stock  principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
under this program  the board approved the authorization to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an undefined period of time 
on february   the board approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional million shares 
share repurchases under the program may be made through open market  established plan or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with all applicable securities laws  rules  and regulations 
there is no expiration date applicable to the program 
the new share repurchase program replaces the program authorized in october on august   we entered into the share repurchase agreement with jp morgan to repurchase approximately million of our common stock  as part of our share repurchase program 
under the share repurchase agreement  we pre paid to jp morgan the million purchase price in the third quarter of for the common stock and jp morgan delivered to us approximately million shares of common stock at an average price of at the completion of the share repurchase agreement in december for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million  including the price paid pursuant to the share repurchase agreement 
as of december   we had repurchased a cumulative total of approximately million shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million since the commencement of the program in as of december   there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
we record stock repurchases as a reduction to stockholders equity 
we record a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased shares as an increase to accumulated deficit when the price of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the issuance of common stock 
during the year ended december   the cumulative price of the shares repurchased exceeded the proceeds received from the 
table of contents issuance of the same number of shares 
the excess of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated deficit for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any common stock 
shareholder litigation related to historical stock option practices see note litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
our revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract revenue generated from agreements with semiconductor companies  system companies and certain reseller arrangements 
royalty revenue consists of patent license and technology license royalties 
contract revenue consist of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our technology solutions into our customers products 
contract revenue may also include support or maintenance 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the pass through of a percentage of the fees paid to the reseller by the reseller s customer for use of our patent and technology licenses 
we do not recognize revenue for these arrangements until we have received notice of revenue earned by and paid to the reseller  accompanied by the pass through payment from the reseller 
we do not pay commissions to the reseller for these arrangements 
in addition  we may enter into certain settlements of patent infringement disputes 
the amount of consideration received upon any settlement including but not limited to past royalty payments  future royalty payments and punitive damages is allocated to each element of the settlement based on the fair value of each element 
in addition  revenues related to past royalties are recognized upon execution of the agreement by both parties  provided that the amounts are fixed or determinable  there are no significant undelivered obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize any revenues prior to execution of the agreement since there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts for royalties related to previous periods or assess collectability 
elements that are related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to past royalty payments and future royalty payments will be recorded as royalty revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
elements that are not related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to punitive damage and settlement will be 
table of contents recorded as gain from settlement which is reflected as a separate line item within the operating expenses section in the consolidated statements of operations 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements  revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payment for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
unbilled receivables represent enforceable claims and are deemed collectible in connection with our revenue recognition policy 
royalty revenue we recognize royalty revenue upon notification by our licensees and when deemed collectible 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
we have two types of royalty revenue patent license royalties and technology license royalties 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and systems companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
for the licensing agreements with fixed royalty payments  we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due 
for the licensing agreements with variable royalty payments which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold  we earn royalties at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the licensees sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
technology licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products  such as rdram tm and xdr tm that we provide to our customers under technology license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the licensees sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
contract revenue we generally recognize revenue using percentage of completion for development contracts related to licenses of our interface solutions  such as xdr tm and flexio tm that involve significant engineering and integration services 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon contract costs incurred 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the total costs required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total efforts necessary to complete a project are less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the newly estimated total efforts necessary to complete a project are longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 

table of contents if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we also recognize revenue for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products that involve non essential engineering services and post contract support pcs 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these arrangements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees which are not essential to the functionality of the product 
our rates for pcs and for engineering services are specific to each development contract and not standardized in terms of rates or length 
because of these characteristics  we do not have a sufficient population of contracts from which to derive vendor specific objective evidence for each of the elements 
therefore  after we deliver the product  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we will recognize all revenue ratably over either the contractual pcs period or the period during which pcs is expected to be provided 
we review assumptions regarding the pcs periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue to be recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a specific loss amount cannot be estimated  we review the range of possible outcomes and accrue the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  of approximately million  which consists of net operating loss carryovers  tax credit carryovers  depreciation and amortization  employee stock based compensation expenses and certain liabilities 
for the year ended december   a valuation allowance of million reduced net deferred tax assets to million 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
our forecasted future operating results are highly influenced by  among other factors  assumptions regarding our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue  our ability to effectively manage our expenses in line with our forecasted revenue and general trends in the semiconductor industry 
we weighed both positive and negative evidence and determined that there is a continued need for a valuation allowance due to projected future losses  which we considered significant negative evidence 
though considered positive evidence  projected income from potential favorable patent and related settlement litigation were not included in the determination for the valuation allowance due to our inability to reliably estimate and objectively verify the timing and amounts of such settlements 
even though we are no longer in a cumulative tax loss position for the last twelve quarters primarily due to certain discrete positive events  the projection of significant future losses is a negative factor that outweighs the positive factors leading to a conclusion that a release of the valuation 
table of contents allowance is not yet appropriate 
if any settlement income is realized  we will reassess our position on maintaining the valuation allowance 
tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions are not to be recognized until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax benefits will be recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although fasb accounting standards codification asc income taxes  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  significant judgment is required by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  we maintained stock plans covering a broad range of potential equity grants including stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units and performance based instruments 
in addition  we sponsor an employee stock purchase plan espp  whereby eligible employees are entitled to purchase common stock semi annually  by means of limited payroll deductions  at a discount from the fair market value of the common stock as of specific dates 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in our statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to our employees  directors and consultants including employee stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units  and employee stock purchase grants 
stock based compensation expense is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  reduced by an estimate of the annualized rate of expected forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employees expected requisite service period  generally using the straight line method 
in addition  the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under previous accounting rules 
our forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised on a cumulative basis  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note  equity incentive plans and stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information regarding the valuation of stock based compensation 
marketable securities available for sale securities are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  both of which are included in interest and other income  net 
realized gains and losses are recorded on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other income  net 
we review our investments in marketable securities for possible other than temporary impairments on a regular basis 
if any loss on investment is believed to be other than temporary  a charge will be recognized in operations 
in evaluating whether a loss on a debt security is other than temporary  we consider the following factors our intent to sell the security  if we intend to hold the security  whether or not it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis and even if we intend to hold the security  whether or not we expect the security to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
due to the high credit quality and short term nature of our investments  there have been no other than temporary impairments recorded to date 
the classification of funds between short term and long term is based on whether the securities are available for use in operations or other purposes 
goodwill costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded as goodwill 
the accounting treatment for goodwill requires that companies not 
table of contents amortize goodwill  but instead test for impairment at least annually using a two step approach 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing each reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step involves determining the fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit 
any excess carrying amount of goodwill over the fair value determined in the second step will be recorded as a goodwill impairment loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa by fitch 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of exposure to million or of the portfolio  whichever is lower  for any one non us government issuer 
a single us agency can represent up to of the portfolio 
no more than of the total portfolio may be invested in the securities of an industry sector  with money market fund investments evaluated separately 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
we may make investments in us treasuries  us agencies  corporate bonds and municipal bonds and notes with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment portfolio is shorter maturities 
all investments must be us dollar denominated 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as treasuries  government agencies  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million including cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis

the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise

the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation

our overseas operations consist primarily of one design center in india and small business development offices in germany  japan  korea and taiwan 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   we believe our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
