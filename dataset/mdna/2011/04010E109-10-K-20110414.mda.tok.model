introduction argan  inc the company  we  us  or our conducts continuing operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries  gemma power systems  llc and affiliates gps that we acquired in december  and southern maryland cable  inc smc that we acquired in july through gps  we provide a full range of development  consulting  engineering  procurement  construction  commissioning  operations and maintenance services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities  independent power project owners  municipalities  public institutions and private industry 
through smc  we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management  construction and maintenance to the federal government  telecommunications and broadband service providers as well as electric utilities 
each of the wholly owned subsidiaries represents a separate reportable segment power industry services and telecommunications infrastructure services  respectively 
overview and outlook for the fiscal year ended january   consolidated net revenues from continuing operations were million  which represented a decrease of million  or  from consolidated net revenues from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year ended january  despite the decline between years in consolidated net revenues  income from continuing operations for the year ended january  was million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the decrease in consolidated net revenues for the year ended january   compared with the consolidated net revenues for the prior year  was due primarily to a decrease of in the net revenues of the power industry services business  which represented of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year 
however  the gross profit of the power industry services segment increased by million to million  or  for the current year compared with the amount of gross profit last year 
this increase was offset slightly by a decline of  in the profitability of the telecommunications infrastructure services businesses 
last year s results included income related to the unconsolidated subsidiary in the total amount of million 
as a result  income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the current year to million at january  our operating activities from continuing operations provided million of cash including income from continuing operations in the amount of million  noncash charges in the amount of million and a net favorable change in working capital accounts in the amount of million 
we used cash in discontinued operations of approximately million 
we also used cash in the total amount of million to retire our bank debt and to make capital expenditures 

table of contents at january   the value of our construction contract backlog was million compared with a backlog value of million as of january  during the current year  we signed a construction and start up services contract  now valued at approximately million  for the construction of a megawatt peaking power plant in connecticut and received the related full notice to proceed 
the completion of the project  which includes the installation of four gas turbines with ancillary equipment and systems  is expected to occur during the second quarter of fiscal year during the current year  the company also was awarded a contract  valued at approximately million  by a wind energy power project development firm for the design and construction of a megawatt wind energy project in henry county  illinois 
the scope of this project includes the design and construction of roads  foundations  and electrical collection systems in addition to erecting one hundred thirty four sets of towers  turbines  and blades 
this project has a planned completion date in the first quarter of during the current year  we substantially completed the construction of a gas fired power plant in northern california that represented approximately million in contract backlog at january  the renegotiation of our engineering  procurement and construction contract for the construction of a gas fired electricity peaking facility in southern california added in excess of million to the total value of our backlog 
substantial commencement of this project is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year this project was awarded to us over two years ago 
during the fourth quarter of the current year  the california energy commission approved the construction of this power plant and the customer informed us of the signing of a power purchase agreement 
although our expectation is that we will be provided with full notice to proceed for this project  we do not know when that will occur 
should construction work on this project not commence soon  our results of operations for fiscal year may be adversely affected  perhaps in a material way 
we cannot provide assurance that the future net revenues associated with this project will ever be recognized 
current economic conditions in the united states  which reflect a weak recovery from the recession and continued disruptions in the credit markets  are likely to adversely affect us through at least a large portion of next year  particularly if the depressed state of the construction industry is prolonged or if the continuing government efforts to stabilize financial institutions  to restore order to credit markets  to stimulate spending and to reduce high unemployment are not effective 
the current instability in the financial markets may continue to make it difficult for certain of our customers  particularly for projects funded by private investment  to access the credit markets to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we may encounter deferrals  delays and cancellations related to new construction projects in the future which could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our services 
in addition  we may encounter requirements in the future to make investments in a new project as a condition of epc contract award 
the sharp reduction in the number of new commercial  industrial and infrastructure construction projects has created an extremely competitive bid environment 
many known competitors are reducing prices  willing to sacrifice margin in order to keep work crews busy 
other construction companies are entering our sector of the industry looking for new work at low margins 
if we are unsuccessful in continuing to add projects to our backlog  our results of operations for the year ending january  may be adversely affected and our financial condition may be weakened 
these uncertain economic conditions are impairing our visibility to an unusual degree 
the expected current year increase in momentum towards more environmentally friendly power generation facilities has not occurred 
the federal government has also failed to enact comprehensive energy legislation  including incentives for the retirement of existing coal burning power plants and caps on the volume of carbon emissions 
this appears even less likely for the foreseeable future with the recent change in the majority control of the us house of representatives 
the majority political party does not support federal government subsidies and incentives for the development of sources of renewable power 
although certain coal fired power plants have been shut down  existing coal plants are proving to be a challenge to retrofit or replace 
coal prices are widely considered to be stable and certain states see the availability of inexpensive  coal fired electricity as a key driver of economic growth 
in addition  with the fate of renewable energy tax incentives unknown  potential energy project developers and investors are hesitant to make commitments related to new renewable energy generation facilities 
an effect of the recession was a two year decline in the demand for power in the united states  the first time this occurred in more than a century 
it will likely take at least several years for power consumption to reach peak levels 
as a result  existing power plants will continue to operate with spare capacity to produce additional electricity 
despite the reductions in the demand for power  certain regions of the country continued to add power generation facilities over the last two years  wind energy facilities in particular 
the combination of new power generation plants and excess generation capacity elsewhere may obviate the need to build power plants during this power demand recovery period 
ultimately  we expect that the negative environmental impact of burning coal  concerns about the safety of nuclear power facilities and political focus on energy independence will spur the development of alternative and renewable power facilities which should result in new power facility construction opportunities for us in the future 
more than half of the states have adopted formal renewable energy portfolio standards and there is federal support for infrastructure spending 
these trends should also lead to additional coal plant shutdowns  and an increase in the demand for not only renewable power generation  but new gas fired power plants as well 

table of contents we continue to observe interest in gas fired generation as electric utilities and independent power producers look to diversify their power generation options 
we believe that the initiatives in many states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  and utilities desire to fill demand for additional power prior to the completion of more sizeable or controversial projects  will stimulate demand for gas fired power plants 
the current year projects in california and connecticut  and the backlog peaking plant project referred to above  are all gas fired electricity generation plants 
in addition  gas fired generation of electricity has the potential to complement wind  solar and other alternative generation facilities because gas fired facilities can be brought on line quickly to smooth the inherently variable generation pattern of these alternative energy sources 
we would also expect power producers to increase future capital spending on gas fired power plants to take advantage of recent lower natural gas prices and the prospect that these prices may remain stable for some time because of gas field development projects in the united states  as well as potential liquefied natural gas imports 
while it is unclear what the future impact of economic conditions might have on the timing or financing of future projects  we expect that gas fired power plants will continue to be an important component of long term power generation development in the united states and believe our capabilities and expertise will position us as a market leader for these projects 
in summary  it is uncertain what impacts the general economic conditions and the aftereffects of the financial credit crisis in the united states may ultimately have on our business 
we are focused on the effective and efficient completion of our current construction projects and the control of costs  which resulted in favorable profit and cash flow results for the current year 
despite the intensely competitive business environment  we are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects 
this approach may result in a low volume of new business bookings until the demand for new power generation facilities and the other construction industry sectors recover fully 
in the meantime  we will conserve cash and strive to maintain an overall strong balance sheet 
we remain cautiously optimistic about our long term growth opportunities 
we are focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future 
we believe that our expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  such forward looking statements  by their nature  involve risks and uncertainties  and they should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report 
discontinued operations in december  our board of directors approved management s plan to dispose of the operations of the nutritional products line of business conducted by its wholly owned subsidiary  vitarich laboratories  inc vli 
since  vli incurred operating results that were consistently below expected results 
the loss of certain major customers and the reduction in the amounts of orders received from other large customers caused net revenues to decline and this business segment to report operating losses 
the board of directors considered that  despite turnaround efforts  vli incurred an operating loss of approximately million for the nine months ended october  we reported operating losses for vli of approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively  including impairment losses related to the indefinite lived and long lived assets of approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
on march   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vli to an unrelated company 
the asset sale was consummated for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to  and the assumption by the purchaser of certain trade payables  accrued expenses and remaining obligations under vli s facility leases 
of the cash purchase price   was paid at closing and the remaining  was placed into escrow 
vli will be paid from the escrow amount as purchased inventory is used in production or sold and purchased accounts receivable are collected 
at the end of nine months of the closing  all money still held in the escrow account will be returned to the purchaser 
including additional loss from operations  we expect the disposition to result in income loss from discontinued operations in the range of  loss to  income for the fiscal year ending january  the assets and liabilities of vli as of january  and are classified as held for sale and the financial results of vli have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the losses from discontinued operations for the years ended january  and were million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
cash used in the discontinued operations of vli for the years ended january  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents comparison of the results of operations for the years ended january  and the following schedule compares the results of our operations for the years ended january  and except where noted  the percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues for the corresponding year 
as analyzed below the schedule  we reported net income of million for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we reported net income of million

the cost of revenues percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues of the applicable segment 
net revenues power industry services the net revenues of the power industry services business decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared with net revenues of million for the prior year 
the net revenues of this business represented approximately of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for both the year ended january  and the year ended january  the operating results of the power industry services segment for the current fiscal year reflected a decline in activity on this segment s largest current project as it moved into the commissioning phase 
net revenues related to this project  a gas fired power plant located in southern california  represented and of power industry services net revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year  respectively  and was substantially completed at january  a year ago  the net revenues related to this project represented and of segment net revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
construction activity on the gas fired peaking plant under construction in connecticut provided net revenues representing and of power industry services net revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year  respectively 
construction activities related to wind energy farms provided approximately of the net revenues of the segment and continuing operations for the current year 

table of contents telecommunications infrastructure services the telecommunications infrastructure services business of smc is challenged by the depressed state of commercial and residential construction activity in the mid atlantic region 
as a result  net revenues for the year ended january  decreased to million compared with net revenues of million for the prior year  representing a decrease between years 
the net revenues of this business represented approximately of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the years ended january  and net revenues related to the performance of outside premises activities increased to approximately of this segment s business for the year ended january  from approximately of this segment s net revenues for the year ended january  due primarily to the amount of work performed under a contract  awarded during the current year  with a local government for the installation of battery systems designed to provide prolonged power for traffic signals during electricity outages  including material purchases  and under a subcontract for both outside and inside plant services on a large commercial building construction project 
smc also experienced an increase in net revenues from its long time local electricity cooperative customer 
we experienced an increase in the number of work orders for maintenance and repair services issued by and completed pursuant to our master agreement with this customer 
as a result  this segment was able to offset substantially the effect of net revenues lost under a services contract with the regional telecommunications service provider that expired at the end of december this business represented approximately of the net revenues of smc for the year ended january  net revenues related to the performance of inside premises cabling activities declined by approximately between years 
smc s second largest customer had a prime contract with the federal government that expired during the current year 
on a subcontractor basis for this customer  we performed inside services at various government installations throughout our region 
the net revenues provided by this customer represented approximately and of smc s net revenues for the years ended january  and  respectively 
smc s business plan for the new fiscal year is based on the continuation of aggressive bid and proposal efforts resulting in the addition of new business 
however  despite our business development efforts  we cannot provide assurance that smc will maintain its current level of net revenues for the fiscal year ending january  cost of revenues due primarily to the decline in consolidated net revenues for the year ended january  compared with the year ended january   the consolidated cost of revenues also declined 
these costs were million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately million between the years  or 
the overall gross profit percentage for the current year improved to from last year due primarily to the change in the mix of projects performed for power industry services customers during the current year as described above 
the margin percentages associated with projects commenced in the current year  which together represented slightly in excess of of this segment s net revenues for the current year  are more favorable than the overall margin percentage experienced on the gas fired power plant construction project located in california which was the primary project underway last year 
the cost of revenues for the power industry services business of gps decreased for the year ended january  to million from million for the year ended january  moreover  the cost of revenues as a percentage of corresponding net revenues decreased to for the current year from last year 
the decrease in this percentage in the current year was due primarily to the types of costs incurred on our largest construction project for the year  as this project neared its completion  and the improved gross profit on newer projects underway during the current year 
for smc  the cost of revenues  expressed as a percentage of corresponding net revenues  increased to for the current year from last year due primarily to a change in the mix of customers contributing to net revenues between the years 
selling  general and administrative expenses these costs increased by  or  to approximately million for the current year from approximately million last year 
the increase in stock option compensation expense of approximately  and the increase in salaries and benefits costs of  due to the consolidation of grp were substantially offset by a reduction of  between years in the amount of bonus expense 

table of contents other income and expense included in these results last year was our share of the earnings of grp  a owned subsidiary until december  of approximately  and the gain of  realized in connection with the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest whereby grp became a wholly owned subsidiary 
income tax expense for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense related to continuing operations of million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of which differed from the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to the unfavorable effects of state income taxes and income tax return to provision true up adjustments in the approximate amount of  for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense of million reflecting an effective annual income tax rate of which differed from the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to the effect of state income tax expense offset substantially by the favorable tax effects of permanent differences including the domestic manufacturing deduction 
for the current year  the favorable income tax effect of the domestic manufacturing deduction was substantially offset by the unfavorable effect of nondeductible stock option and other compensation expenses 
liquidity and capital resources as of january  the balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the current year to a balance of million as of january  compared with a balance of million as of january  last year  cash and cash equivalents declined by million 
the changes between the years in the mix and status of the power plant construction projects under construction by gps was a significant factor in the improvement in cash flows for the year ended january  consolidated working capital increased during the current year to million as of january  from approximately million as of january  we also have an available balance of million under our revolving line of credit financing arrangement with bank of america the bank 
in march  the bank agreed to extend the expiration date of the line of credit to may management expects that it will succeed in obtaining a renewal of the line of credit at the expiration of the current term 
for the year ended january   net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million 
we reported income from continuing operations of approximately million for the current year 
the amount of non cash adjustments to income from continuing operations for the current year represented a net source of cash of approximately million  including stock compensation expense of  amortization and depreciation of  and deferred income tax expense of  during the current year  the increase in accounts receivable represented a million use of cash as construction activity increased for the gas fired power peaking facility under construction in connecticut 
however  the allowable billings on this project have included amounts covering forecasted short term costs resulting in an increase during the current year in billings in excess of actual costs and estimated earnings as well 
this increase represents a source of cash in the amount of million 
the decrease in activity on the gas fired power plant located in california was the primary cause of the decreases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and accounts payable and accrued expenses which represented net cash amounts of million and million provided by and used in operating activities during the current year  respectively 
during the current year  we also reduced the amount of cash subject to restrictions as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  providing net cash in the amount of million 
reflecting cash used by the discontinued operations of vli in the amount of million  net cash provided by operations was million for the current year 
last year  despite reporting income from continuing operations of approximately million  we used net cash in continuing operations in the amount of million 
we experienced changes in the amounts of several operating asset and liability accounts that represented uses of cash due primarily to the timing of billings on the california power plant construction project as activity on this project increased during the year 
an increase in the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and a decrease in the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represented uses of cash in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we also used cash last year to make payments reducing the amount of accounts payable and accrued liabilities by million 
net cash amounts of million and million were provided by decreases in the balances of accounts receivable and restricted cash  respectively 
non cash adjustments to income from continuing operations represented a net source of cash in the amount of  last year  including stock compensation expense of  amortization and depreciation of  and deferred income tax expense of  these amounts were substantially offset by two items included in income from continuing operations without providing cash the equity in the earnings of the unconsolidated subsidiary in the amount of  and the gain realized on the bargain purchase of the remaining ownership interest in this entity in the amount of  cash used by the discontinued operations of vli in the amount of million was reflected in net cash used in operations in the amount of million last year 

table of contents during the year ended january   we used net cash in connection with financing and investing activities in the amounts of  and  respectively  due primarily to principal payments made during the year to retire our remaining term note with the bank totaling  and the net purchases of property plant and equipment by continuing operations in the amount of  during the year ended january   net cash was used in connection with financing activities in the amount of  as we used cash to make principal payments on long term debt totaling  and received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants and options in the amount of  exercises of stock options and warrants provided net cash proceeds of only  during the year ended january  prior year investing activities provided net cash in the amount of  the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in grp resulted in the net addition of  in cash 
capital expenditures made last year by continuing operations used  in net cash 
the financing arrangements with the bank provide for the measurement at our fiscal year end and at each of our fiscal quarter ends using a rolling month year of certain financial covenants  determined on a consolidated basis  including requirements that the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  that the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  and that the fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than to at january  and  we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants 
the bank s consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pledged the majority of the company s assets to secure the financing arrangements 
the amended financing arrangement contains an acceleration clause which allows the bank to declare amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements due and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the financial condition of any of our companies 
we believe that the company will continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangement 
if the company s performance results in our noncompliance with any of the financial covenants  or if the bank seeks to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above  we would seek to modify the financing arrangement  but there can be no assurance that the bank would not exercise its rights and remedies under the financing arrangement including accelerating payment of any outstanding senior debt due and payable 
subsequent to january   we received the required consent from the bank in order to complete the disposition of substantially all of the assets of vli 
at january   most of the balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in money market funds sponsored by an investment division of the bank 
our operating and restricted bank accounts are maintained with the bank 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from our future operations and funds available under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future without deterioration of working capital 
any future acquisitions  or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement  may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  significant dilution to the existing stockholders may result 
off balance sheet arrangements we maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
in the ordinary course of business  our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made 
each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation 
if necessary  we may obtain standby letters of credit from the bank in the ordinary course of business  not to exceed million 
the financial crisis associated with the recession has not disrupted our insurance or surety programs or limited our ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity 
we also have a line of credit committed by the bank in the amount of million for general purposes 
from time to time  we provide guarantees related to our services or work 
if our services under a guaranteed project would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency  then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies 
when sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable  we would record such guarantee losses 

table of contents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non gaap measurement we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure  the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions 
further  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance 
as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  the results of our operations presented in accordance with us gaap that are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our ebitda does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
the following table presents the determinations of ebitda for continuing operations for the years ended january  and income from continuing operations  as reported interest expense income tax expense amortization of purchased intangible assets depreciation and other amortization ebitda as we believe that our net cash flow from continuing operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with us gaap  the following table reconciles the amounts of ebitda for the applicable years  as presented above  to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows provided by used in continuing operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows ebitda current income tax expense interest expense non cash stock option compensation expense equity in the earnings of an unconsolidated subsidiary gain from bargain purchase decrease in escrowed cash increase decrease in accounts receivable change related to the timing of scheduled billings decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities other  net net cash provided by used in continuing operations inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our costs and expenses  such as those for employee compensation and benefits and commodities used in construction projects  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long term construction contracts  the valuation of goodwill  other indefinite lived assets and long lived assets  the valuation of employee stock options  income tax reporting and the reporting of legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  is included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
the types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which net revenues are based on a fixed price or cost plus fee basis 
net revenues from cost plus fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned  measured using the cost to cost method 
net revenues from fixed price construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant costs  including materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimate 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual net revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we review the estimate of total cost on each significant contract monthly 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
these costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize net revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin when the change order is formally approved by the customer 
net revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the consolidated balance sheet 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
changes to the total estimated contract cost of a fixed price contract may affect the amount of profit or the extent of loss 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by management s experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of gps  vli and smc  we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships  proprietary formulas  non compete agreements and trade names 
other than goodwill  most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives 
at february   the beginning of our most recent fiscal year  the total carrying value of goodwill and the remaining purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life totaled approximately million  which represented approximately of consolidated total assets 
this amount included million in goodwill related to the acquisition of gps 
the company reviews for impairment  at least annually  the carrying values of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life 
the annual review performance date is november we also perform tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value might be impaired 

table of contents as prescribed by current accounting guidance  we determine whether goodwill has been impaired or not using a two step process of analysis 
the first step of our goodwill impairment testing process is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the determination of the fair value of gemma as of november  a variety of alternative valuation approaches were considered 
as a result of the analysis  we concluded that the market multiple and the discounted cash flow analysis approaches were the most appropriate valuation techniques for this exercise 
for the market multiple valuation  a fair value estimate for gps was determined based on an evaluation of the market values of a selected number of reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
a separate estimate was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projected cash flows for gps were developed based on its historical financial performance  a short term projection of operating results based on the existing backlog of current business and the assumed addition of certain identified future projects  and published projected growth rates for the power construction industry 
the projected cash flow amounts were discounted to present value based on rates of return which were determined considering prevalent rates of return  business risks for the industry and risks specifically related to gps 
a weighting was applied to the results of the market multiple valuation and the discounted cash flow analysis of fair value in order to arrive at an average amount considered the fair value of gps 
as a result of this valuation  we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of gps substantially exceeded its carrying amount 
therefore  the goodwill of gps was deemed not to be impaired  and the performance of step two of the impairment assessment process was not required 
using a discounted cash flow analysis  we determined that the fair value of our other indefinite live asset  the trade name of smc  exceeded the corresponding carrying value of  at november  long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of equipment used in our operations 
fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to twenty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of certain long lived assets is evaluated periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances such as poor operating results of the applicable business segment indicate that the asset s should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  including disposition  on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets to determine if an impairment exists 
if we identify a potential impairment  we will estimate the fair value of the assets through known market transactions of similar equipment and other valuation techniques  which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair value 
deferred tax assets as of january  and  our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets in the total amounts of million and million  respectively  resulting from our future deductible temporary differences 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
at this time  we believe that the strong earnings performance of our power industry services business segment will continue during the periods in which the applicable temporary income tax differences become deductible 
accordingly  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
the amounts of income from operations before income taxes for this business segment were million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
stock options we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards and recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods 
options to purchase  and  shares of our common stock were awarded during the years ended january  and  respectively  with weighted average fair value per share amounts of and  respectively 
the amounts of compensation expense recorded during the years ended january  and related to vesting stock options were million and million  respectively 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations which are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk free interest rate  the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of the stock option 
we use of a simplified method in developing the estimates of the expected lives of stock options  as we believe that our historical stock option exercise experience is insufficient to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards 

table of contents legal contingencies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in each case 
at this time  we do not believe that a material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed therein 
however  we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter 
we review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter  and make adjustments to the balances if necessary 
should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change  significant losses or additional costs may be recorded 
adopted and other recently issued accounting pronouncements included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report are discussions of accounting pronouncements adopted by us during the year ended january  that we consider relevant to our consolidated financial statements and recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted
