the company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and  accordingly  the prices of its products 
the company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies 
price increases and  in certain situations  price decreases are implemented for individual products  when appropriate 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
the company does not believe that inflation has significantly affected its results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates for product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  litigation and other subjective matters impacting the financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
contracts  internet commerce agreements  and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
all substantial risk of ownership transfers to the customer 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
this is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as by the customer s payment history 
estimated costs of returns and allowances and discounts are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates and any specific customer collection issues the company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
management s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs 
inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the company 
the company also considers current forecast plans  as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels 
though the company considers these balances to be adequate  changes in economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
generally  annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in assessing the recoverability of the company goodwill and other intangible assets  the company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  no impairment exists 
when fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate fair value requires a number of key estimates and assumptions 
we estimate the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs 
we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation 
this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which includes certain assumptions made by management such as market capital structure  market betas  risk fee rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 
changes in these key estimates and assumptions  or in other assumptions used in this process  could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year 
a number of factors  many of which the company has no ability to control  could affect its financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the company uses in its calculation 
these factors include a prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in demand for the company s products  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the company s competitors to gain market share 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as unplanned negative cash flow indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
application of alternative assumptions  such as changes in estimate of future cash flows  could produce significantly different results 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
warranties the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
warranty reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the company 
estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience  expectation of future conditions and known product issues 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers  to help minimize warranty obligations 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu 
asu allows a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
the provisions of asu are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of the provisions of asu is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  since asu only amends the disclosure requirements concerning comprehensive income  the adoption of asu will not affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
