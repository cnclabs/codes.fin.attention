table of contents our broad portfolio of windows management products simplifies it tasks on almost every microsoft platform  and represents the largest portion of our total revenues 
today  quest is one of microsoft s leading independent software vendors with solutions that help our customers automate  secure and extend microsoft infrastructure and windows desktops 
our virtualization management product area grew from the acquisition of vizioncore into our position today as a leading independent software vendor in the virtualization management space 
our robust portfolio of solutions spans server virtualization  desktop virtualization  and cloud automation while supporting multiple hypervisor platforms 
in january  we acquired bakbone software to complement our data protection portfolio  particularly in the areas of virtual server backup and recovery 
this acquisition brings additional technologies and products which provide data protection solutions across heterogeneous physical  virtual and application level environments 
strategic acquisitions and investments have been a key part of our corporate strategy 
over the past three years  we spent approximately million on acquisitions and invested million in early stage private companies 
this strategic deployment of capital covered many of our existing market segments  including application management  windows management  and virtualization management 
we intend to continue to identify and acquire companies in adjacent or contiguous markets  as we have done in the past 
we have also used acquisitions and investments to build upon or extend our core competencies with incremental technology to increase our existing product functionality or complete a key portion of a deliverable on the product roadmap 
we derive revenues from three primary sources software licenses  post contract technical support services maintenance and consulting and training services 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses  wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive maintenance for a defined period of time 
our license fees are typically calculated either on a per server basis  per managed user or a per seat user basis 
maintenance contracts entitle a customer to telephone or internet support and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year maintenance contracts are typically sold with the related perpetual software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter at the customer s option 
generally  annual maintenance renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial customer purchase price which includes both the fee for a perpetual license and first year maintenance 
revenue is allocated to first year maintenance based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months  although at times  we sell maintenance with terms of greater than months 
we also provide consulting and training services that relate to the installation and configuration of our products  but do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
revenue allocated to consulting and training services is analyzed based on vsoe of fair value and recognized as the services are performed 
such revenues represented percent  percent and percent of total services revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
summary of consolidated financial results as discussed in more detail throughout our md a  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance total revenues increased by million  or  to million  total expenses increased by million  or  to million  income from operations increased by million  or  to million  other expense income  net decreased from a gain of million to a loss of million  diluted earnings per share increased by  or  to  weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding decreased from million and million in to million and million in 
table of contents our total revenues increased by compared to the same period in our americas sales region  which includes united states  canada and latin america  as well as our asia pacific apac sales region  delivered a strong performance throughout the year 
our emea sales region  which includes europe  the middle east and africa  showed significant improvement in the last quarter of the year which contributed to an increase in revenues for the year compared to the same period in our americas sales region contributed of total revenues and the rest of the world contributed of total revenues in as compared to and in the comparable period last year 
our license revenues grew compared to the same period in the increase in our total revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of our windows management products  particularly our exchange  migration identity management solutions  and related professional services 
we expect continued strength in our windows management products due to our customers migration to microsoft exchange server and the growth within the identity and access management idam market 
the continued need for it system access controls to comply with existing and new regulations and the growing need to automate and control end user access to it resources are driving our idam growth 
in addition  we acquired v lcker in july and surgient in august refer to note acquisitions of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
these acquisitions contributed to approximately of our overall increase in total revenues compared to the same period in our acquisition of v lcker gives us access to a larger aspect of the identity access management market and the continued expansion of our identity management solution capabilities whereas with surgient  we added private cloud management capabilities to our virtualization product portfolio 
in january  we acquired bakbone software to complement our data protection portfolio  particularly in the areas of virtual server backup and recovery 
this acquisition gives us additional technologies to provide data protection solutions across heterogeneous physical  virtual and application level environments  making quest a leader in the data protection market 
revenues from our virtualization management products increased significantly compared to the same period in we expect this trend to continue as companies continue to embrace virtual computing 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this major growth trend as we offer flexible solutions for managing virtualized it infrastructure 
total revenues in fiscal year were positively impacted by the weak us dollar relative to certain us dollar currencies  partially offset by a strong us dollar relative to the euro and british pound in the second half of the year 
the impact from foreign currency resulted in higher us dollar equivalent sales of approximately million 
total expenses increased compared to the same period in our expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  which include compensation  benefits and payroll related taxes and are primarily a function of our worldwide headcount 
our average full time employee headcount for the fiscal year decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year our average full time employee headcount in locations outside of the united states was  for fiscal year  a decrease of compared to  for fiscal year our total expenses in fiscal year were impacted by the weak us dollar  partially offset by a strong us dollar relative to the euro and british pound in the second half of the year  which resulted in higher us dollar equivalent expenses 
our total expenses in fiscal year increased by million compared to the same period in as a result of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates when comparing rates to net increase in total expenses was primarily due to the increase in sales and marketing expenses  million of which was due to higher sales commissions and bonuses as a result of higher revenues compared to the fiscal year also  our acquisitions of v lcker and surgient contributed to approximately million of the net increase in total expenses relating to their operating costs 
foreign currency while we are a us dollar functional company on a world wide basis  we transact business and operate using multiple foreign currencies 
as such  the value of our revenues  expenses  certain account balances and cash flows are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the value of the us dollar 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against several non us dollar currencies as has recently occurred  our foreign revenues and thus our total revenues can be negatively impacted 
a stronger us dollar translates into lower expenses in those entities where we have operations and our personnel and occupancy expenses are denominated in non us dollars  resulting in lower total expenses 
conversely  a weaker us dollar would have the opposite effects on total revenues and expenses 
in certain geographic regions and within specific currencies  partial offsets between revenues and expenses or balance sheet positions may reduce this exposure 
in other instances  we can manage our operations to reduce foreign currency exposure or utilize derivative instruments to manage this exposure 
see note derivative instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details

table of contents our revenues for fiscal year are comprised of of license revenues and of service revenues compared to of license revenues and of service revenues in fiscal year licenses revenues the increase in license revenues was due primarily to increased sales of our windows management products across all geographic regions 
our windows products  led by migration  continued to perform well due to customers adoption of exchange also  our identity and access management products  a key growth area in our windows management business  continued to expand and gain market share with the quest one identity solution 
our license revenues were also positively impacted by the weak us dollar relative to certain non us dollar currencies in  partially offset by strong us dollar relative to the euro and british pound 
this resulted in a higher us dollar equivalent for several currencies 
since certain of our international sales are denominated in these non us dollar currencies  the impact from foreign currency comprised approximately million  or of the overall increase in license revenues 
services revenues services revenues are derived from post contract technical support services maintenance and consulting and training services 
the largest component of our services revenues is maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenues are generated from support and maintenance services relating to current year sales of new software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
the main driver of our growth in services revenues was maintenance renewals on our windows management products across geographic regions 
also  contributing to the growth in services revenues were maintenance renewals on our virtualization management products across all geographic regions 
maintenance revenues from our database management products decreased particularly in the americas region 
revenue from consulting and training services as a percentage of total service revenues was approximately and of total service revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues continue to contribute a larger percentage of our total revenues primarily because of maintenance contracts associated with our growing installed base of customers and because maintenance contract growth exceeds that of license contracts from time to time 
as our maintenance customer base grows  maintenance renewals have a larger influence on the maintenance revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect 
therefore  the growth rate of total revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of changes in our maintenance revenue profile is the extent to which our customers renew their annual maintenance agreements  taking into account the number of products and licenses for which each customer renews  and the timing of the renewals by each such customer 
if our maintenance renewals were to decline materially  our maintenance revenues  total revenues and cash flows would likely decline materially as well

maintenance revenues from our database management products decreased particularly in the emea region 
revenue from consulting and training services as a percentage of total service revenues was approximately and of total service revenues in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues continue to contribute a larger percentage of our total revenues for two primary reasons growth of our installed base of customers via new license sales  and acquisitions and their related maintenance contracts 
as our maintenance customer base grows  maintenance renewals have a larger influence on the maintenance revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect

if our maintenance renewals were to decline materially  our maintenance revenues  total revenues and cash flows would likely decline materially as well 
over the past twelve months we have experienced declining growth in our maintenance revenues and expect this trend to continue through at least the three main reasons for this decline are reduced sales of new software licenses during  fewer acquisitions which resulted in less revenue contribution from acquired deferred maintenance revenues  and impact from foreign currency

interest will accrue at a floating rate based on  at the company s election  i libor subject to reserve requirements and a minimum libor of or ii the greatest of a  b the federal funds rate plus or c wells fargo s prime rate  in each case  plus an applicable margin 
the credit agreement includes limitations on the company s ability to  among other things  incur debt  grant liens  make acquisitions and other investments  make certain restricted payments such as dividend payments  and dispose of assets 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  subject to certain exceptions including the company headquarters facility 
as of december   we have a zero balance outstanding under this line of credit 
on february   this line of credit agreement was amended and renewed for a subsequent five year term with wells fargo capital finance  llc formerly known as wells fargo foothill  llc  as arranger  administrative agent and lender refer to note subsequent events of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
in july  we drew down million  or  of the par value against the value of our ars 
as this credit line was structured as a net no cost loan  any interest charges will be offset by interest earned on the underlying ars 
as of december   we had a million recorded as current loans payable in our balance sheet 
we fully paid our remaining balance outstanding on our ubs financial services line of credit from the proceeds on redemptions of our auction rate securities in the second quarter of in august  we entered into a loan agreement with mutual of omaha bank whereby we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million 
the loan is secured by our real property at our headquarters in aliso viejo  california 
we intend to use the proceeds from the loan for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the loan matures in five years  during which time we will make equal monthly principal and interest payments at a interest rate on a fixed rate  year amortization schedule 

table of contents events of default include  among other things  payment defaults  breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events 
in the case of a continuing event of default  the lender may  among other things  accelerate the payment of any unpaid principal and interest amounts  increase the then current interest rate by and foreclose on the real estate collateral 
we were in compliance with all debt related covenants at december  for additional information on our loans payable  please refer to note loans payable of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
as we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions  potential future stock repurchases or other general corporate expenditures which may be in excess of current cash available within certain operating entities  sourcing cash to fund these activities requires financial flexibility afforded by financing instruments 
as such  we plan to continue to evaluate potential debt financings when and if reasonable financing terms become available to us 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances  cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next to months 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under part i  item a  risk factors  of this report 
one of these risks is that our future business does not stay at a level that is similar to  or better than  our recent past 
in that event  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and debt financing to support our working capital and other cash requirements 
also  acquisitions are an important part of our business model 
as such  significant amounts of cash could and will likely be used in the future for additional acquisitions or strategic investments 
if additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements  acquisitions or other purposes  we may seek to raise funds through public or private equity or  as discussed above  debt financing or from other sources 
we can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that could reduce our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  and the effect we expect such obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations loans payable  including interest contingent consideration total contractual cash obligations our purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing contracts  public relations contracts and committed sales events 
we enter into earn out agreements with the shareholders of certain companies we acquire 
the earn out contingency are typically based on the acquired company s products total revenue or sales growth over a specified period after the acquisition date 
refer to note acquisitions and note fair value measurements of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
in addition to the cash commitments above  million of unrecognized tax benefits  excluding penalties and interest of million  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb s interpretation of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled and is not included in the above table refer to note income taxes of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future 
table of contents events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below and our significant accounting policies presented within note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally perpetual software licenses and which portions must be deferred generally maintenance  consulting and training services 
in addition  we analyze various factors including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us make judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgments with respect to any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
we recognize revenue pursuant to fasb s authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition 
we cannot recognize any revenue before all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we deliver the products  fees are fixed or determinable and license agreement terms are free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
we initially capture value for our products by selling a perpetual software license to end customers 
the fee for the first year of maintenance is included in  or bundled with  the perpetual software license at the time of initial sale 
as such  the combination at initial sale of a perpetual software license and one year of maintenance represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
when all four of our revenue recognition criteria are met  the multiple element aspect of our arrangements means the only revenue recognized upfront  at the time of initial sale  is the residual revenue allocated to the perpetual software license 
the revenue associated with the fair value of the undelivered maintenance and or consulting and training services included in the initial sale is deferred and is subsequently recorded to revenue ratably over the support term and as such services are performed  respectively 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on vsoe of fair value 
revenue for our standalone sales of annual maintenance renewals in years two  three and beyond is recognized ratably over the support term 
sales of maintenance for multiple annual periods are treated similarly 
revenue from our consulting and training services is generally recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the underlying service contracts 
our maintenance vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the prices our customers pay for this support when it is sold separately  that is  when we enter into an arms length  annual renewal transaction with customers where the only offering sold is maintenance 
these standalone maintenance renewal transactions are typically one year in duration and are priced as a targeted percentage of the initial  purchase price which includes both the upfront license fee and the first year of maintenance 
we bill maintenance renewal transactions in advance of the services provided 
we also offer customers the right to purchase maintenance for multiple annual periods at discounted prices beyond the first year as they will be paying cash upfront  well in advance of the multi year services performed 
our consulting and training services vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to our established pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
our consulting and training services are typically sold as time and materials based contracts that range from five to fifteen days in duration 
we sell consulting and training services both standalone and as part of multiple element arrangements 
our vsoe of fair value is impacted by estimates and judgments that  if significantly different  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
these estimates and judgments include  among other items the ability to identify and validate vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements via the use of sampling techniques  
table of contents the impact on sampling results of customer negotiating pressure on renewal rates  the impact on sampling results of maintenance renewals on deals originally sold via indirect channels  the fair value of the undelivered element for sampled transactions  and the economic impact of combining multiple renewal rate negotiations relative to varying products with varying purchase dates  into a single  new coterminous maintenance 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance  consulting and training services but we may modify our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
this could result in changes to our vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this were to occur  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements would differ significantly from our historical results 
if we were unable to support at all through vsoe the fair value of our maintenance  consulting or training services  the entire amount of revenue from our initial  upfront sale of both a perpetual software license bundled with one year of maintenance and any consulting and training services would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element hardware  software  specific upgrade rights  etc 
in a bundled software and services arrangement  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services are performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses each year wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive maintenance for a defined period of time 
approximately of license revenue was generated by these time based software licenses 
all license and support revenues on these term licenses are deferred and recognized ratably over the license term 
we license our products primarily through our direct sales force  our telesales force and  increasingly  indirect channels including value added resellers and distributors 
for our direct sales  we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions upon which our products and services are sold to our end customers 
for our indirect sales transactions  we accept orders from our resellers and distributors when they have existing orders from an end customer 
indirect sales through resellers are a growing proportion of our transaction volume 
these transactions are generally handled via processes and policies that are similar to an end customer sale 
we utilize written contracts coupled with purchase orders as the means to establish the terms and conditions of these indirect sales transactions 
we recognize revenue from reseller and distributor transactions upon invoicing the order provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for those resellers and distributors that have established a history of consistent  timely cash collection with us  we accept orders and recognize revenue upon shipment since the resellers and distributors have existing orders from an end user customer 
for those resellers that have not established a history of consistent  timely cash collection with us  we accept orders and defer revenue until cash collection occurs 
the probability of collection criteria per gaap is applied to each individual reseller or distributor rather than to all channel partners sales in aggregate 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
since such acceptance provisions are not contained in our software license arrangements as standard provisions and the incidence of returns in accordance with such acceptance provisions cannot be reasonably estimated  if a contract does include such a provision we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that cancellation is not likely  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other requirements have been met 
our standard payment terms require payment within days but may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
we generally deem payments that are due within months to be fixed and determinable based on collections history and thereby satisfy the required revenue recognition criteria 
for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for sales returns and cancellations as well as an allowance for bad debt 
regarding our allowance for sales returns and cancellations  our standard form license and maintenance and or service agreements do not typically or expressly provide for product returns or cancellations as a matter of right unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established written specifications 
however  we maintain the sales returns and cancellations allowance to cover the circumstances where the company accepts returns or cancellations on a discretionary basis even though not contractually obligated to do so 
this allowance also covers estimated losses for our customer s unwillingness to make required payments 
the allowance for bad debt is for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments related to enforceable contracts 
to support both these allowances  we are required to make significant estimates of future software license returns  of cancellations for both maintenance and consulting and training services  and of write offs of customer accounts as bad debts all related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on these estimates  the contractual terms and conditions of our contracts  our accounts receivable aging and our historical collection experience with a customer base 
if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
while such return  cancellation and bad debt write off amounts have historically been within our planned expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that our sales returns and allowances will be adequate to cover future performance issues of our customer base and allowances may be required which would result in less revenues and additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of and determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach and income approach were the methodologies deemed the most reliable and were the primary methods used for our impairment analysis 
based on our most recent annual impairment review  the estimated fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value 
we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews could result in significant charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
amortizing intangible assets these assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and include acquired technology  in process research and development ipr d  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks and trade names acquired and are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we make estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  acquired company key personnel s willingness and ability to compete  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the net carrying amount of amortizing intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
investments in non consolidated companies all of our investments in non consolidated companies are currently accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist when we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  voting rights and the impact of 
table of contents commercial arrangements  are also typically considered in determining the appropriate accounting treatment 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies and  as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes but is not limited to a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes  and impacts from competitive pressures 
if we determine that the carrying value of our investment in a company is at an amount above fair value  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our obligation for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a significant amount of judgment  estimation and uncertainty and our estimate of income taxes can be highly sensitive to shifts of taxable income reported between such tax jurisdictions 
additionally  our us and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that could result from the examination of our tax returns 
determining the income tax expense for such contingencies requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
both steps presume that the tax position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this may require us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  current year tax positions  expiration of statutes of limitations  litigation  legislative activity  or other changes in facts and circumstances 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in that period 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such uncertain tax positions could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded as a separate component in our long term income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
should that judgment change  us income taxes would have to be recognized on those undistributed earnings no longer considered to be permanently invested 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions per gaap 
under gaap  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility based upon historical volatilities of our common stock 
we determine the expected term of our stock based awards based on historical exercise patterns across two different groups of employees 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 

table of contents determining functional currencies for purpose of the consolidation of non us subsidiaries in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to re measure the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their local currency into united states dollars 
this process results in foreign currency re measurement gains and losses included in other expense income  net in the consolidated income statements 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these re measurement gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including transfer pricing arrangements  billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is one consideration of determining the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
other expense income  net includes any gain or loss associated with the re measurement of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the united states dollar 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements into the united states dollar would be included within accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the local currency  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
as a result of this determination  assets and liabilities in these subsidiaries are re measured at current period end exchange rates  except for property and equipment and deferred revenue  which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are re measured at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period except for revenue and costs related to the above mentioned balance sheet items which are re measured at historical exchange rates 
accordingly  we had a net foreign currency re measurement loss gain of million for the year ended december  and a net foreign currency re measurement loss of million for the year ended december   recorded to other expense income  net in the respective periods 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the local currency  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our statement of stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income for each of the years presented  and would not have the impacts on our net income that are currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon fluctuations within the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies and the effect of any foreign currency hedging activities that we have entered into see note derivative instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
the company operates in a number of currencies worldwide  most notably in the euro  the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and russian ruble 
any future re measurement gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are a us dollar functional company and transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to both transaction and translation risk relating to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk originates both from our foreign operations net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses depending on the directional movement of the foreign currencies versus the us dollar and our operational profile in foreign subsidiaries 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and the correlative relationships of different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
during the twelve months ended december   we had a positive effect  or an increase of million on total revenues and a negative effect in the form of an increase to total expenses by million related to foreign currency fluctuation when comparing rates to in addition  for the twelve months ended december   within other expense income  net we had foreign currency loss gain of million compared to million in 
table of contents the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the australian dollar and the russian ruble 
in  we implemented a foreign exchange hedging program 
we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency contracts to reduce the range of outcomes foreign currency rate changes can have on non functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions  which include certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below 
the duration of these contracts ranges from less than one month to nine months 
a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivative instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the magnitude of success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
to the extent our estimates are correct  gains and losses on our forward foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
in order to monitor the financial impact of our foreign currency hedges  we subject our hedges to a stress test 
this test is intended to quantify the impact to our financial statements of an abnormal change in the foreign currency rates in which we do business 
when subjected to a and adverse change  we estimated that the fair value of our contracts would decline by million and million  respectively 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into foreign currency contracts with reputable financial institutional counterparties whose financial health we monitor 
to date  we have not experienced nonperformance by any of these counterparties and anticipate performance by all counterparties 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts of our outstanding foreign currency contracts at december  and all contracts have maturities of nine months or less 
in us dollars in thousands december currency australian dollar canadian dollar chinese yuan danish krone euro british pound israeli shekel brazil real swedish krona norwegian krone russian ruble total interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we traditionally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and money market funds and articulate allocation limits in our investment policy to any one issuer other than the united states government 
our investment portfolio as of december  consisted of money market funds  us treasuries  us agency securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and corporate bonds 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify our investments as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
trading securities are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value reported in earnings
