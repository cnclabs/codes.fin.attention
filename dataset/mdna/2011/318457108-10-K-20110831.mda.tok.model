our real estate and corporate segment consists of activities related to the disposition of real estate held for sale  interest expense associated with debt  and other general corporate overhead expenses 
the following table presents selected financial data for our insurance operations and real estate and corporate segments in thousands 
year ended june  revenues insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total income loss before income taxes insurance real estate and corporate consolidated total our insurance operations generate revenues primarily from selling  servicing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance policies and related products in states 
we conduct our underwriting operations through three insurance company subsidiaries first acceptance insurance company  inc  first acceptance insurance company of georgia  inc and first acceptance insurance company of tennessee  inc our insurance revenues are primarily generated from premiums earned  including policy and renewal fees  from sales of policies written and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  commission and fee income  including installment billing fees on policies written  agency fees and commissions and fees for other ancillary products and services  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 
the following table presents gross premiums earned by state in thousands

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the following table presents the change in the total number of policies in force pif for the insurance operations 
pif increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that are canceled or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  policies in force beginning of period net decrease during period policies in force end of period the following tables present total pif for the insurance operations segregated by policies that were sold through our open and closed retail locations as well as our independent agents 
for our retail locations  pif are further segregated by i new and renewal and ii liability only or full coverage 
new policies are defined as those policies issued to both first time customers and customers who have reinstated a lapsed or cancelled policy 
renewal policies are those policies which renewed after completing their full uninterrupted policy term 
liability only policies are defined as those policies including only bodily injury or no fault and property damage coverages  which are the required coverages in most states

the components of the combined ratio are as follows 
loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of insurance operating expenses to net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by commission and fee income from insureds 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the loss  expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations 
year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined excluding the severance and related benefits charges incurred in connection with the separation of certain executive officers of million during march  the expense and combined ratios for the year ended june  were and  respectively 
investments we use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our investment portfolio 
the investment manager conducts  in accordance with our investment policy  all of the investment purchases and sales for our insurance company subsidiaries 
our investment policy has been established by the investment committee of our board of directors and specifically addresses overall investment goals and objectives  authorized investments  prohibited securities  restrictions on sales by the investment manager and guidelines as to asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
management and the investment committee meet regularly with our investment manager to review the performance of the portfolio and compliance with our investment guidelines 
the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable  investment grade  us government securities  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates or the credit quality of specific securities 
the value of our consolidated investment portfolio was million at june  and consisted of fixed maturity securities and an investment in a mutual fund  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
at june   we had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million in our consolidated investment portfolio 
at june   of the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated investment grade a credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating organizations 
the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was aa at june  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
we believe that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
investments in cmos had a fair value of million at june  and represented of our fixed maturity portfolio 
at june   of our cmos were considered investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies 
in addition  of our cmos were rated aaa and of our cmos were backed by agencies of the united states government 
of the non agency backed cmos  were rated aaa

amortized gross unrealized gross unrealized fair cost gains losses value us government and agencies state political subdivisions revenue and assessment corporate bonds collateralized mortgage obligations agency backed non agency backed residential non agency backed commercial redeemable preferred stock total fixed maturities  available for sale investment in mutual fund  available for sale the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of our fixed maturity securities at june  based on their fair values in thousands 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities with no all securities with securities with unrealized gains or fixed maturity unrealized gains unrealized losses losses securities one year or less after one through five years after five through ten years after ten years no single maturity date other than temporary impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  we separate other than temporary impairment otti into the following two components i the amount related to credit losses  which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and ii the amount related to all other factors  which is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit related portion of an otti is measured by comparing a security s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield prior to the impairment charge 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our investment portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in filings with the sec for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the full recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the issuer specific factors considered in reaching the conclusion that securities with declines are not other than temporary include i the extent and duration of the decline in fair value  including the duration of any significant decline in value  ii whether the security is current as to payments of principal and interest  iii a valuation of any underlying collateral  iv current and future conditions and trends for both the business and its industry  v changes in cash flow assumptions for cmos and vi rating agency actions 
based on these factors  we make a determination as to the probability of recovering principal and interest on the security 
on a quarterly basis  we review cash flow estimates for certain non agency backed cmos of lesser credit quality following the guidance of fasb asc  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
fasb asc 
accordingly  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual or estimated prepayment or credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated  otti is deemed to have occurred 
for non agency backed cmos not subject to fasb asc  we review quarterly projected cash flow analyses and recognize otti when it is determined that a loss is probable 
we have recognized otti related to certain non agency backed cmos as the underlying cash flows have been adversely impacted due to a reduction in prepayments from mortgage refinancing and an increase in actual and projected delinquencies in the underlying mortgages 
our review of non agency backed cmos included an analysis of available information such as collateral quality  anticipated cash flows  credit enhancements  default rates  loss severities  the securities relative position in their respective capital structures and credit ratings from statistical rating agencies 
we review quarterly projected cash flow analyses for each security utilizing current assumptions regarding i actual and anticipated delinquencies  ii delinquency transition to default rates and iii loss severities 
based on our quarterly reviews  we determined that there had not been an adverse change in projected cash flows  except in the case of those securities discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  which incurred otti charges recognized in the consolidated statement of operations of million and million for the years ended june  and we believe that the unrealized losses on the remaining non agency backed cmos for which otti charges have not been recorded are not necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of the underlying collateral 
we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
we believe that the remaining securities having unrealized losses at june  were not other than temporarily impaired 
we also do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell any of these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
year ended june  compared with the year ended june  consolidated results revenues for the year ended june  decreased to million from million in the prior year 
loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with income before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the loss before income taxes for the year ended june  included a goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of million  or per share on a diluted basis  favorable development of million for losses occurring in prior fiscal years  charges of million incurred in connection with the separation of certain executive officers during march comprised of million in accrued severance and benefits and a million non cash charge related to the vesting of certain stock awards and million of other than temporary impairment charges on investments

table of contents first acceptance corporation k premiums earned premiums earned decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in premiums earned was primarily due to a decline in the number of pif from  at june  to  at june   which was impacted by the closure of underperforming stores 
at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  premiums earned were also negatively impacted by an increase in the percentage of pif with liability only coverage 
although the number of pif sold through our open stores decreased from  at june  to  at june   for those policies quoted  we have experienced a higher close ratio for the year ended june  compared with the prior year 
commission and fee income commission and fee income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase in commission and fee income was a result of higher fee income related to commissionable ancillary products sold through our retail locations offset by the decrease in the number of pif 
investment income investment income increased to million during the year ended june  from million during the year ended june  this increase in investment income was primarily a result of the higher yield obtained on the mutual fund investment made in june at june  and  the tax equivalent book yields for our fixed maturities portfolio were and  respectively  with effective durations of and years  respectively 
net realized losses on investments  available for sale net realized losses on investments  available for sale during the year ended june  included million in net realized gains on sales and redemptions and million of charges related to otti on certain non agency backed cmos 
net realized losses on investments  available for sale during the year ended june  included million in net realized gains on sales and redemptions and million of charges related to otti on certain non agency backed cmos

loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  we experienced favorable development related to prior fiscal years of million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  the favorable development for the year ended june  was primarily due to lower than anticipated severity of accidents occurring during the fiscal and accident years  specifically in bodily injury coverage in texas  tennessee and south carolina and physical damage coverages in georgia  partially offset by higher loss adjustment expenses specific to bodily injury and florida no fault coverages 
excluding the development related to prior fiscal years  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for the years ended june  and were and  respectively 
the year over year increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily due to i the increase in the percentage of liability only policies which generally have a higher expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio than full coverage policies  ii higher loss adjustment expense due to anti fraud and litigation avoidance initiatives and iii the impact of spring storm related losses 
we have substantially completed the process of implementing a new multivariate pricing program 
we believe this new pricing program provides us with greater pricing segmentation and improves our pricing relative to the risk we are insuring 
currently  approximately of our pif have been underwritten using this new pricing program  which has now been implemented in nine of the twelve states in which we operate 
we plan to implement the new pricing program in the three remaining states in which we operate by december 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k operating expenses insurance operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in costs such as employee agent commissions and premium taxes that varied along with the decrease in premiums earned as well as savings realized from the closure of underperforming stores  offset by severance and related benefits charges of million incurred in connection with the separation of certain executive officers during march the expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  excluding the severance and related benefits charges noted above  the expense ratio for the year ended june  was  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  excluding the severance and related benefits charges noted above  the combined ratio for the year ended june  was 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment we recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge in fiscal year of million 
we are required to perform periodic impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the fair value of our reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  was estimated utilizing both i a cash flow projection derived from our long range strategic plan using a discount rate of  which was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with our operations and ii recent industry transaction and trading trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
as a result of recent trends in industry transaction and trading multiples  we recognized a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which included a million addition to deferred tax liabilities 
a variance in the discount rate could have had a significant effect on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recognized 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in the goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trademarks and trade names 
in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of decisions made by management during the most recent quarter regarding entity wide branding initiatives  we recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million related to trade name intangible assets 
we do not believe that these non cash impairment charges will have a materially adverse impact on the continuing operations  liquidity  or statutory surplus of the company 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k our evaluation includes multiple assumptions that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us or unfavorable industry transaction multiples and trading trends continue  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decline in our common stock trading price may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for fiscal year the provision for income taxes relates to current state income taxes for certain subsidiaries with taxable income 
the current fiscal year includes an adjustment that reduced certain accrued state income taxes 
at june  and  we established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing our ability to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
we placed greater weight on historical results than on our outlook for future profitability 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be adjusted in future periods if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is adjusted  we would record an income tax benefit for the adjustment 
real estate and corporate loss before income taxes from real estate and corporate operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with a loss from real estate and corporate operations before income taxes of million for the year ended june  segment losses consist of other operating expenses not directly related to our insurance operations  interest expense and stock based compensation offset by investment income on corporate invested assets

table of contents first acceptance corporation k premiums earned premiums earned decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in premiums earned was due to weak economic conditions  which caused both a decline in the number of policies written  as well as an increase in the percentage of our customers purchasing liability only coverage 
the closure of underperforming stores also contributed toward the decrease in premiums earned 
the number of policies in force at june  decreased over the same date in from  to  due to the factors noted above 
at june   we operated stores  compared with stores at june  commission and fee income commission and fee income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in commission and fee income was a result of the decrease in the number of policies in force  partially offset by higher fee income related to commissionable ancillary products sold through our retail locations 
investment income investment income decreased to million during the year ended june  from million during the year ended june  the decrease in investment income was primarily a result of the sale of fixed maturity investments in fiscal year to generate taxable income to utilize expiring nols and the reduced yields obtained on reinvestment

loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended june   compared with for the year ended june  we experienced favorable development related to prior periods of million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  the favorable development for the year ended june  was due to lower than anticipated severity of accidents occurring during the fiscal and accident years  primarily in bodily injury coverage in georgia and south carolina  an improvement in our claim handling practices and a shift in business mix toward renewal policies  which have lower loss ratios than new policies 
the favorable development for the year ended june  was primarily due to both lower than anticipated severity and frequency of accidents  most notably in our property and physical damage coverages 
excluding the favorable development related to prior periods  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for the years ended june  and were and  respectively 
the year over year increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was due to higher frequency of accidents experienced during the first half of calendar year 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k operating expenses insurance operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in costs such as employee agent commissions and premium taxes that varied along with the decrease in premiums earned as well as savings realized from the closure of underperforming stores 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for fiscal year the year over year increase in the expense ratio was due to the decrease in premiums earned  which resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses in our retail operations such as rent and base salary 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  litigation settlement litigation settlement costs for the year ended june  were million  compared with million for fiscal year the reduction in expense during the year ended june  related primarily to the forfeiture of premium credits by georgia and alabama class members 
the year ended june  included costs incurred in connection with our settlement and defense of the litigation as described further in note to our consolidated financial statements  a million insurance recovery from our insurance carrier regarding coverage for the costs and expenses we incurred relating to the settlement  and reductions in expense related to the forfeiture of premium credits by georgia and alabama class members 
goodwill impairment we recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year of million as a result of the adverse impact of difficult economic conditions on our customers and business and the resulting decline in its share price during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the fair value of our reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  was estimated utilizing both i a cash flow projection derived from our long range strategic plan using a discount rate of  which was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with our operations and ii recent industry transaction and trading trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
this non cash goodwill impairment charge did not have a materially adverse impact on the continuing operations  liquidity  or statutory surplus of the company 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for fiscal year the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  related to current state income taxes for certain subsidiaries with taxable income 
at june  and  we established a full valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets 
in assessing our ability to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
we placed greater weight on historical results than on our outlook for future profitability 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be adjusted in future periods if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is adjusted  we would record an income tax benefit for the adjustment 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  included the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets which  in combination with the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge  resulted in a net increase in the tax provision of million during the three months ended june  this charge was partially offset by a million tax benefit related to the utilization of tax nol carryforwards expiring in that had been previously reserved for through a valuation allowance resulting in a net increase in the tax provision for the year of million 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k real estate and corporate loss before income taxes from real estate and corporate operations for the year ended june  was million  compared with a loss from real estate and corporate operations before income taxes of million for the year ended june  segment losses consist of other operating expenses not directly related to our insurance operations  interest expense and stock based compensation offset by investment income on corporate invested assets 
we incurred million of interest expense during both the years ended june  and related to the debentures issued in june during the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with borrowings under our former credit facility 
the credit facility was repaid in full and terminated on october  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are premiums  fees and investment income from our insurance company subsidiaries and commissions and fee income from our non insurance company subsidiaries 
our primary uses of funds are the payment of claims and operating expenses 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  and was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for both periods was primarily the result of a decrease in cash collected from premiums written 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was million compared with net cash used in investing activities of million for the prior fiscal year 
the year ended june  included net reductions in our investment portfolio of million  while the prior fiscal year included net additions to our investment portfolio of million 
the net reductions in the current fiscal year were primarily a result of maturities and redemptions 
the net additions in the prior fiscal year were primarily the result of the reinvestment of the proceeds from sales in the prior fiscal year of investments to generate taxable income to utilize expiring tax net operating loss carryforwards 
our holding company requires cash for general corporate overhead expenses and for debt service related to our debentures payable 
the holding company s primary source of unrestricted cash to meet its obligations is the sale of ancillary products to our insureds and  if necessary  the holding company may receive dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
the holding company also receives cash from operating activities as a result of investment income 
through an intercompany tax allocation arrangement  taxable losses of the holding company provide cash to the holding company to the extent that taxable income is generated by the insurance company subsidiaries 
at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
these funds and the additional unrestricted cash from the sources noted above will be used to pay our future cash requirements outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
the holding company has debt service requirements related to the debentures payable 
the debentures are interest only and mature in full in july interest is fixed annually through july at million 
the debentures pay a fixed rate of until july   after which time the rate becomes variable libor plus basis points 
based on current libor interest rates  our interest expense related to the debentures would decrease beginning in august state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from our insurance company subsidiaries 
based on our earned surplus  we believe that we have total dividend capacity for the next twelve months of million  of which million would be deemed extraordinary and subject to regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital provides formulas to determine each december on an annual basis the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
there are also statutory guidelines that suggest that on an annual calendar year basis an insurance company should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to on a combined basis  the ratios for our insurance company subsidiaries of net premiums written for the last twelve months to statutory capital and surplus were to at june  based on our current forecast on a combined basis  we anticipate that our risk based capital levels will be adequate and that our ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus will not exceed the to statutory guideline for the reasonably foreseeable future 
we therefore believe that our insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus available to support their net premium writings in this time frame 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows as noted above  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs  for both the holding company and our insurance company subsidiaries  in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
any future growth strategy may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we cannot assure that additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period at june  in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves debentures payable capitalized lease obligations operating leases severance obligations other total contractual cash obligations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates  however  based on historical payment patterns  the amount presented is our estimate of the expected timing of these payments 
the timing of these payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents intended to provide adequate cash flows for such payments 
payments due by period assume a contractual fixed interest rate of until july   after which the rate becomes variable libor plus basis points  or at july  
consists primarily of rental obligations under real estate leases related to our retail locations and corporate offices 
trust preferred securities on june   first acceptance statutory trust i fast i  our wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust entity  completed a private placement whereby fast i issued  shares of preferred securities at  per share to outside investors and  shares of common securities to us  also at  per share 
fast i used the proceeds from the sale of the preferred securities to purchase million of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the debentures will mature on july  and are redeemable by the company in whole or in part beginning on july   at which time the preferred securities are callable 
the debentures pay a fixed rate of until july   after which the rate becomes variable libor plus basis points 
the obligations of the company under the junior subordinated debentures represent full and unconditional guarantees by the company of fast i s obligations for the preferred securities 
dividends on the preferred securities are cumulative  payable quarterly in arrears and are deferrable at the company s option for up to five years 
the dividends on these securities  which have not been deferred  are the same as the interest on the debentures 
the company cannot pay dividends on its common stock during any such deferments 
fast i does not meet the requirements for consolidation of fasb asc  variable interest entities 
off balance sheet arrangements we use off balance sheet arrangements eg  operating leases where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use 
for additional information with respect to our operating leases  see contractual obligations above and note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting estimates 
valuation of deferred tax asset we maintain income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting estimate because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are attributable to our insurance operations and were initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests as of the last day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives have been fully amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  further impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as quoted market prices in active stock markets are relevant evidence of fair value  a significant decline in our common stock trading price may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
investments our investments are recorded at fair value  which is typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
management reviews investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary would result in a charge against income for the credit related portion of any such impairment 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our investment portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
as accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported ibnr 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries 
each of our insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses  including case reserves and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilize our actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
see item business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in this report for additional information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates  generally  the fair value of fixed income investments moves inversely with movements in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
likewise  the underlying investments of our current mutual fund investment are also fixed income investments 
this portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of our insurance company subsidiaries are managed to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates resulting from parallel shifts in market yield curves on our fixed maturity portfolio in thousands 
it is assumed that the effects are realized immediately upon the change in interest rates 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these and other reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
