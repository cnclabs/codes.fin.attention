table of contents the building of an efficient and flexible manufacturing and supply chain 
our strategy is to build our products using a combination of internal factories and contract manufacturers  whether for wafer fabrication or assembly 
we use our internal factories primarily to manufacture our new products and products where we utilize proprietary technologies 
we also use external foundries and contract manufacturers to supplement our internal capacity and respond to changes in demand for wafer fabrication and back end assembly  and to manufacture certain of our older technology products 
as part of our plan to use external contract manufacturers to more efficiently manage changes in demand  during fiscal year we added additional capacity to our existing contract wafer fabrication capacity and assembly capacity 
our goal is to utilize external contractors for percent of our wafer fabrication requirements and percent of our packaging needs 
while we have achieved these goals in the past  these external contractor percentages may fluctuate quarter to quarter based upon management s decision to maintain efficient and flexible manufacturing during periods of lower or higher end market demand  the availability of internal and external capacity and the lead times required to increase capacity  as well as adjustments made by us in light of actual and or anticipated demand 
during our fiscal year  we initiated plans to consolidate and close certain of our wafer fabrication facilities in newport  wales and el segundo  california 
however  due to the significant increase in demand  those facilities that had been closed as part of the consolidation plan for newport  wales have been reopened and the closure of the el segundo  california facility has been suspended  for the foreseeable future

table of contents manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing involves two phases of production wafer fabrication and assembly 
wafer fabrication requires a sequence of process steps that expose silicon wafers to chemicals that change their electrical properties 
the chemicals are applied in patterns that define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices  termed die or chips on each wafer 
assembly is the sequence of production steps that divide the wafer into individual chips and enclose the chips in structures  termed packages which make them usable in a circuit 
power semiconductors generally use process technology and equipment already proven in the manufacturing of ics

marketing  sales and distribution for the fiscal year ended june   we derived approximately percent  percent and percent of our revenues from sales to distributors  oems  and contract manufacturers  respectively 
our sales organization consists of ir sales employees  ir field application engineers  and ir inside sales employees as well as external sales representatives 
we divide our sales team into regional sales organizations in the americas  europe  asia pacific and japan 
our regional sales organizations are supported by the business unit groups within each of our reportable segments which coordinate the marketing activities for their respective products 
the regional sales organizations are also supported by logistics organizations which manage owned warehouses as well as relationships with third party delivery hubs 
product orders flow to our manufacturing facilities or third party contract manufacturers  which make the products 
the products are then shipped through owned warehouses or third party delivery hubs to the customer 
the primary function of our sales organization is focusing on company demand creation activities to help identify power management energy efficient opportunities within our key customer applications  assist our customers in designing our products into their applications  and providing longer term solutions based on our customers technology and product requirements 
in some circumstances  we sell our products to the contract manufacturer of the oem

competition we believe that our comprehensive line of power management products and our ability to combine these products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions differentiates us from our competition 
our products compete with products manufactured by others  in varying degrees  on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  and service including technical advice and support 
generally  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive  and subject to rapid price changes  cyclical demand and product design changes 
we face significant competition in each of our product lines from well established international semiconductor companies 
several of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources with which to pursue design  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 

table of contents our major competitors for fiscal year ended june  were as follows segment competitors alphabetical power management devices fairchild  infineon  on semiconductor  stmicroelectronics and vishay energy saving products fairchild  infineon  ixys  mitsubishi  nxp  renesas  stmicroelectronics and toshiba automotive products fairchild  infineon  nxp  stmicroelctronics  and vishay enterprise power infineon  intersil  maxim  on semiconductor  texas instruments  and volterra hirel aeroflex  crane  heico  and microsemi research and development for fiscal years  and  we spent million percent of revenues  million percent of revenues  and million percent of revenues  respectively  on r d activities 
our r d program focuses on the advancement and diversification of our technology platforms and products  as well as next generation technologies 
technology platforms supported include our power management ic platforms  our mosfet and igbt switch platforms  as well as packaging multichip module platforms such as supirbuck and iram ps multi chip modules 
our r d effort also focuses on developing longer term  broadly applicable new technologies such as ganpowirtm  international rectifier s proprietary gan on si based power conversion device platform 
based on all these platforms  we have been developing and introducing power management products and new architectures for the next generation of applications  including new game stations  high performance servers  hybrid vehicles and energy efficient appliances 
our product design centers are located throughout the world  including the united states  and europe 
during fiscal year  we continued to introduce advanced power management solutions that drive high performance computing and save energy across our served markets 
these products included a integrated power stage devices  b ics and chipsets improving power density and efficiency in dc dc applications found in high performance computers and servers  c the continued expansion of our popular xphase and directfet product families  d ics for class d audio  electronic lighting ballasts and motor control  e several application ready reference designs for point of load dc dc conversion  multi channel class d audio  lighting and motor control  f our smartrectifier ics helping computer and consumer entertainment devices meet emerging system and standby power regulations  g radiation hardened dc dc converter modules for space satellite power applications and h expansion of our igbt and mosfet switch product families 
we also continue to commit substantial resources to r d to generate new patents and other intellectual property related to our technologies and products 
backlog our sales are generally made on a purchase order basis  with lead times varying depending on market conditions and internal capacity factors 
customers are generally not subject to long term contracts 
however  we have from time to time entered into long term supply agreements with certain customers 
these long term supply agreements generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments  and products to be delivered and the related delivery schedules under these long term contracts could be frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
accordingly  because of these factors our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues 
seasonality our revenues are affected by the cyclical nature of the business of the end users of our products and the trends in our customers end markets 
as a result  our results typically vary within a given customer segment across a fiscal year as conditions in end user markets change and also in response to macro economic and industry long term trends and business cycles 

table of contents intellectual property we continue to make significant investments in developing and protecting our ip 
in the past fiscal year  we added over patents worldwide 
we have approximately issued unexpired us patents and over patent applications pending worldwide 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademarks hexfet and directfet 
we believe that our ip contributes to our competitive advantage 
we are committed to enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights  including through litigation if necessary 
we report within our ip segment revenues from the sale and or licensing of our technologies and manufacturing process know how and settlements of claims brought against third parties 
in the fiscal years  and  we derived million  million and million of royalty revenues  respectively 
ip segment revenues are dependent on our licensed mosfet  hvic and package technology patents  the continued enforceability and validity of those patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such revenues is subject to a number of risks see part i  item a  risk factors our ongoing protection and reliance on our ip assets expose us to risks 
many of the mosfet patents that have generated royalties and prior settlements have expired  with the broadest of them having expired in calendar year we continue to derive royalty revenues from hvic and package technology patents 
with the expiration of our broadest mosfet patents  most of our ip segment revenues stream ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we continue  from time to time  to enter into opportunistic licensing arrangements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy 
aside from our mosfet technologies  our ip strategy has been to use our ip primarily for the design and development of a value added family of products  and to defend those products in the marketplace 
from time to time  we also engage in opportunistic licensing 
in our ip segment  we continue to evaluate licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and thereby enhance the growth of our products in various end market applications 
environmental matters federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
despite our efforts and controls  from time to time  issues may arise with respect to these matters 
additionally  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if released substances damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by or violation of us to comply with any prior  current or future environmental laws and regulations

risk factors statement of caution under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k includes some statements and other information that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the materials presented can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  should  view  or will or the negative or other variations thereof 
we caution that such statements are subject to a number of uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect our actual results include those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and other uncertainties disclosed in our reports filed from time to time with the sec 
unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  to reflect new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results changes in end market demand  due to downturns or changes in the highly cyclical and volatile semiconductor industry or due to other economic factors such as significant fluctuations of oil prices  adverse impacts from financial markets  could affect our operating results and the value of our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and remains volatile  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
the value of our business may decline during the down portion of cycles or rapid adverse changes in demand 
during fiscal years  and  we experienced a decline in end market demand for our products as a result of the sharp corrections in the general economy  financial markets  housing market and the significant fluctuations of oil prices which resulted in under utilization of our manufacturing capacity and declining revenues and gross margins 
in addition  we have previously recorded significant charges to recognize impairment in the value of our manufacturing equipment  the cost to reduce workforce  and other restructuring costs under those circumstances  and could again in the future if such conditions recur 
demand recovered significantly during the second half of fiscal year and during fiscal year  however  the semiconductor industry continues to be characterized by annual seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand  and our revenues and gross margin continue to be highly dependent on the level of corporate and consumer spending in various information technology and energy saving end market applications 
as a result  our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in particular quarters of our fiscal year 
the industry has also been impacted by significant shifts in consumer demand due to economic downturns or other factors  which may result in diminished product demand and production overcapacity 
we have experienced substantial quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and expect  in the future  to continue to experience short term period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 
to the extent these market conditions persist for a prolonged period of time  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
in addition  we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales  changes in product mix sought by customers  seasonality  price competition for orders and the costs associated with the introduction of new products and start up of new facilities and additional capacity lines 
the markets for our products depend on continued demand associated with the foreseeable product technological platforms and in the mix we plan for and produce in the information technology  consumer  industrial  hirel and automotive markets 
changes in the demand mix  needed technologies and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products  inventory and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents general economic conditions continue to be uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
the current global macroeconomic environment has impacted levels of consumer spending  caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy  and the outlook for overall macroeconomic conditions is uncertain 
these macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business  operating results  or financial condition in a number of ways 
if consumer spending does not continue to develop or decreases  or general economic conditions deteriorate  we could experience significantly diminished demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if the financial condition of current or potential customers or distributors is adversely affected  those parties may not pay us or may delay paying us for previously purchased products 
also  if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted  and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
the semiconductor business is highly competitive and increased competition could adversely affect the price of our products and otherwise reduce the value of an investment in our company 
the semiconductor industry  including the sectors in which we do business  is highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  including price  product performance  technology platform  product availability  quality  reliability and customer service 
price pressures often emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices or by offering a more desirable technological solution 
technology alternatives from competitors can also reduce our ability to win customer design possibilities and thereby reduce sales generally 
pricing and other competitive pressures can adversely affect our revenues and gross margin  and hence  our profitability 
we also compete in various markets with companies of various sizes  many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus they may be better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
new technologies could result in the development of new products and a decrease in demand for our products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
our failure to develop new technologies or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we must devote significant resources to r d  especially with respect to our new gallium nitride technologies 
our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner including our gallium nitride technologies  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets or our inability to capitalize on our new gallium nitride technology before others  could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce die sizes and improve manufacturing yields across our product lines 
we cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues  profitability and target model goals may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our growth strategy  consisting of continued optimization of our operations and accelerating revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in the future 

table of contents if the demand for our products or a particular mix of our products increases faster than we anticipate or are able to produce  we may not be able to satisfy the demand with our planned available capacity  which could limit our revenue growth potential and expose us to loss of design and sale opportunities  and potential liability 
we have experienced a significant increase in demand during fiscal year  and as a result our lead times for many of our products have increased and we have had challenges being able to meet the demand  especially for particular product lines 
the markets in which we operate are very cyclical and subject to large swings in demand 
we attempt to install internal or external capacity to meet our demand forecast and our customer demands for particular products 
however  since additional capacity can take up to six months or more to install  if the demand for our products or a particular mix of our products increases at a rate faster than we anticipate or are able to produce  we may not be able to increase our internal and external manufacturing capacity fast enough to satisfy the higher demand 
as a result  our revenue growth may be limited by manufacturing capacity constraints available to us 
we have also had delays and may experience future delays in the shipment of certain of our products to customers 
to the extent we are not able to satisfy customer demands timely or otherwise  we may risk the loss of design and sales opportunities which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to the extent we are not able to satisfy our contractual obligations to fulfill products  we may be subject to potential claims 
while we would defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims  large claims  if found meritorious  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
delays in initiation of new production at our more advanced facilities or at third party manufacturers  implementing new production processes or resolving problems associated with technical equipment availability or malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing capacity and efficiencies 
our manufacturing capacity and efficiency will be important factors in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or sufficiently to meet available demand 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
additionally  our strategy for increased capacity includes the greater use of third party manufacturers for wafer and product assembly 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have at times experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or third party manufacturers  or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes or new locations 
as a consequence  we have experienced delays in our ability to increase capacities  delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
additionally  from time to time  there are market restraints on the ability to obtain  whether because of the expansion of lead times or availability  necessary equipment from third party equipment manufacturers to allow for timely increase our capacity as planned or needed 
additionally  we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields  experience product delivery delays  and or quality issues in the future  as a result of  and among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  delays in upgrading or expanding existing facilities  changing our process technologies or qualifying third party manufacturers to produce our products  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues or our inability to meet customer demands 
also  our operating results have in the past and in the future would be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenue does not increase proportionately 
our ongoing protection and reliance on our ip assets expose us to risks 
we have traditionally relied on our patents and proprietary technologies for protection of the products we sell and for licensing revenues 
enforcement of our ip rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully continue to protect our ip rights  especially in foreign markets 
most of our mosfet patents  including our broadest  have expired 
with the expiration of most of our mosfet patents  most of our royalty revenues ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  however  from time to time  we continue to enter into opportunistic licensing arrangements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy  although our royalty income levels are substantially lower than in prior years 
what royalty income we obtain is largely dependent on the following factors remaining coverage under unexpired mosfet patents  the continuing introduction and acceptance of products that are not covered by our patents  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  market conditions and mix of products sold by licensees  the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated  and our ability to obtain revenues from new licensing opportunities 

table of contents we cannot guarantee that we can obtain new licenses to produce royalties or that we will continue to receive royalties from existing licenses 
while we try to predict the effects of these factors and efforts  often there are variations or factors that can significantly affect results different from that predicted 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that our predictions of our ip segment revenues will be consistent with actual results  nor can we guarantee the level of our future royalty income 
decreases in our royalty income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies expose us to risks and could negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products or in products we develop 
our ability to maintain such technologies is achieved in part by defending and maintaining the validity of our patents and defending claims brought by our competitors and other third parties of ip infringement  and at times by asserting ip claims against third parties 
we have asserted ip claims against others and we could become subject to other lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the ip rights of others 
we also license certain patents and other technologies owned by others 
our involvement in existing and future ip litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
if any such infringements exist  arise or are claimed in the future against us  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent or other technology owners  discontinue  change our processes or products  or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
for licenses we have  our ability to continue to use such technologies depends on our ability to maintain such licenses 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we would be successful in our claims against third parties 
our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  the occurrence of litigation itself or our failure to be successful in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if some oems do not design our products into their equipment or if we do not convert design or program wins to actual sales  for whatever reasons  a portion of our revenues may be adversely affected 
a design win or program award from a customer does not guarantee that the design or program win will become future sales to that customer 
we also are unable to guarantee that we will be able to convert these design or program wins  or any wins  into sales for the life of any particular program  or at all  or that the revenues from such wins would be significant 
we also cannot guarantee that we will achieve the same level of design or program wins as we have in the past  or at all 
without design or program wins from oems  we would only be able to sell our products to these oems as a second source  if at all 
once an oem designs another supplier s semiconductor into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design or program wins with that oem s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk 
achieving a design or program win with a customer also does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer 
accordingly  if oems do not design our products into their equipment or if we do not convert design or program wins to actual sales  for whatever reasons  our revenues may be materially adversely affected 
third party interruptions  delays or cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including among other things  silicon  mold compounds  lead frames and assembly equipment  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner from our third party suppliers or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may discontinue products  extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints  market conditions or other factors 
for example  we have experienced material cost increases for commodity metals that are included in materials used in our manufacturing processes  and the future cost of these materials remains uncertain 
additionally  we have a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations  our revenues  and adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand  and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents interruptions  delays or cost increases at our key facilities may impair our competitive position and our operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our wafer product at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities 
any disruption of operations at those facilities  whether as a result of equipment malfunction or maintenance needs  natural and man made disasters  or other effects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues  meet customer demand and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our decision to implement a new enterprise resource planning erp software platform has been subject to some delay  could be subject to further delays  may cost more than expected and could interrupt operational transactions during the implementation 
we have previously announced a plan to implement sap s enterprise resource planning software  as well as related enhancements to our integrated financial and supply chain management systems 
this process is complex  time consuming and expensive 
operational disruptions during the course of this process or delays in the implementation of these enhancements could materially impact our operations 
our ability to forecast sales demand  ship products  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired while we are making these enhancements 
we have already experienced some delay in the implementation of the erp system and there is no guarantee that other delays will not take place 
further changes in scope  timeline or cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
our products may be found to be defective and  as a result  product claims may be asserted against us  which may harm our business and our reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our results and financial condition 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated 
although we maintain quality control systems  we ship large quantities of semiconductor products to a wide range of customers around the world  for use in a variety of high profile and critical applications 
in the ordinary course of our business  we receive claims that some of these products are defective or that do not perform to published or agreed specifications 
since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them and potential consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers depending on applicable law and contract  we often need to defend against claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profit we receive from the products involved 
in addition  our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business 
even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims  we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation 
our results of operations and business would be adversely affected as a result of significant alleged quality or performance issues in our products  or if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result 
although we currently have product liability and other types of insurance  we have certain deductibles and exclusions to such policies and may not have sufficient insurance coverage 
we also may not have sufficient resources to satisfy all possible product liability or other types of product claims 
in addition  in our hirel segment  we are sometimes subject to government procurement regulations and other laws that could result in costly investigations and other legal proceedings as a consequence of allegedly defective products or other actions 
any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products  loss of customers and harm to our business and reputation 
our reliance on third party contractors to fabricate semiconductor wafers and to assemble certain of our parts as a lower cost alternative may expose us to business risks 
some of our semiconductor wafer is fabricated by third party contractors and some of our products are assembled and tested by third party contractors 
we have used these contractors as a lower cost alternative to in house manufacturing  and to increase our capacity flexibility 
we review these contractors references  and historical manufacturing experience prior to the engagement of their services  and require oversight over their quality assurance processes 
however  if we fail to adequately or completely review the contractors historical or current manufacturing processes  or if the contractors do not perform as needed  the quality of our parts could be subject to higher failure rate  which could adversely impact our reputation and the growth of future business with the customers as a result 

table of contents we have an existing dispute with one of our contractors over quality matters involving assembled product and commercial disputes with others  and there can be no assurance that other disputes will not arise 
in some instances  we do not have long term agreements with our contractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify contractors  assemblers and testers and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to fabricate wafers  or to assemble or test product 
any delivery delays from contractors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these contractors were disrupted or terminated 
our business depends  in part  upon the efforts of third parties  which we cannot control 
we rely on contractors to manufacture certain of our products 
although we believe that parties to any such arrangements would have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities may not be within our control 
there can also be no assurance that these parties or any future parties will perform their obligations as expected which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation  reduction or delay in delivery schedules  which may result in lower than expected revenues and gross margin 
with certain exceptions related to products within our hirel segment  we manufacture primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand generally or in the mix of that demand 
accordingly  many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products  and a specific mix of products  without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to build them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory the value of our inventory  our revenues and our operating results generally 
additionally  cancellation or significant reduction in significant customer programs  like those for next generation servers  could materially affect our ability to achieve our revenues and gross margin targets 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot guarantee that our inventory will be adequate to meet market demand  commitments to customers or will be salable at a future date 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot guarantee that the inventory we build will be adequate or the right mix of products to meet market demand 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary materials  and build the proper mix and amount of inventory  otherwise our revenues and gross margin may be adversely affected  and we may not be able to meet our customer commitments for deliveries of product 
to the extent we have made commitments to customers  and do not satisfy those commitments  we may be exposed to claims for damages 
additionally  if we produce or have produced inventory that does not meet current or future demand  we may determine at some point that certain of the inventory may only be sold at a discount or may not be sold at all  resulting in the reduction in the carrying value of our inventory and a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must commit resources to product manufacturing prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment 
we sell products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory and our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our distribution channel partners may return inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 
many of our distributors have some rights to return inventory under their stock rotation programs or may return inventory with our approval or under other circumstances 
in addition  we have  from time to time  accepted  and may in the future accept  additional returns 
if these distributors return a large amount of inventory  our operating results could be impacted by lower revenues and higher costs associated with inventory write offs 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
the loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  any reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or the cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel  and key executive officers required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel  and key executive officers 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
while we try to ensure continuity of management in crucial areas we cannot guaranty that these efforts will be successful in all crucial areas including the oversight of our financial reporting systems  financial controls and corporate governance practices 
similarly  there is no assurance that we will be able to retain any of our existing key personnel  or attract  assimilate and retain the additional personnel needed to support our business 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner may be adversely impacted which may result in a material weakness or a material misstatement which may result in considerable additional expense  negatively impact investor confidence and adversely impact the price of our common stock 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in certain prior years  we had previously determined that we had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
while these material weaknesses have been remediated  there is no assurance that we would not have additional material weaknesses in the future 
each material weakness results from a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner 
to the extent we have material weaknesses  we must perform extensive additional work  at considerable additional expense  to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements 
in addition  it is possible that in the future  as a result of our assessment of our internal control that we may identify material weaknesses and be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of investor confidence in our internal controls 
the failure to remediate any such potential material weaknesses in a timely manner may cause us to fail to complete our periodic filing requirements in a timely manner 

table of contents we have previously been named as a defendant in lawsuits and may in the future be named as defendant in other lawsuits that may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
previously we and certain of our former executive officers and current and former directors had been named as defendants in several securities class action  derivative and other lawsuits  and had been subject to investigations by governmental agencies 
while we have reached agreements to settle certain of these lawsuits and others have been dismissed  other lawsuits and proceedings remain 
certain of these lawsuits that continue through the date of this report are described in note  litigation  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item there can be no assurance that we would not be subject to additional lawsuits and other legal proceedings in the future 
for any such current or future lawsuits and proceedings  our attention may be diverted from our ordinary business operations and we may incur significant expenses associated with defense including substantial fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors who may be parties to or involved in such action or proceeding 
depending on the outcome of these lawsuits and proceedings  we may also be required to pay material damages and fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  or suffer other penalties  remedies or sanctions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  our ability to meet our debt obligations and  consequently  negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed and the intercompany pricing related to those profits  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation expense  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including transfer pricing guidelines  changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  or the repatriation of non us earnings against which we have not previously provided us taxes 
in addition  we have made certain judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on our assessment whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets  after considering all available positive and negative evidence 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future given unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws or other factors  valuation allowances may be recorded or increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to reduce income tax expense  or credit additional paid in capital or other comprehensive income  as applicable 
our hirel segment is subject to governmental regulation and procurement processes that expose us to additional risks 
our hirel segment manufactures and sells certain products that are subject to us export control laws and regulations 
the hirel segment also manufactures and sells products that are sold indirectly to the us government and may subject us to certain government procurement regulations  investigations or review 
while we maintain a system of controls of such products and for compliance with such laws and regulations  we cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls  including the failure of human judgment 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of controls or are otherwise found non compliant with applicable laws and regulations  violations could lead to governmental investigations  fines  penalties and limitations on our ability to export product from the us  all of which could have a material effect on our financial results 
quality control and similar standards are applicable to our facilities and the facilities of our contractors in which certain products of our hirel segment are manufactured  and these standards are subject to compliance review by certain us government agencies 
our use of third party facilities meeting such standards is subject to negotiation of satisfactory agreements with those parties and if we cannot reach such agreements  our hirel segment may experience production constraints and its revenues may be materially reduced 

table of contents in addition  certain of the products that our hirel segment sells are either directly or indirectly subject to governmental regulation regarding its use or governmental procurement processes where restrictions on use  quantities of purchase and product programs can vary from time to time outside of the control of the company 
to the extent governmental regulation  or changes therein  or procurement decision making  are not favorable to the company  the results of our hirel segment may be materially adversely affected 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future 
our common stock  which is traded on the nyse  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results  earnings below analysts estimates and financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent periods  our common stock  the stock market in general and the market for shares of semiconductor industry related stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
any similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies 
we can provide no assurance that our share price will remain stable on a going forward basis or that we would not be subject to stockholder claims in this regard 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a regular upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment  especially for new technologies we develop  including without limitation  our gallium nitride technologies 
we are also attempting to add the appropriate level and mix of capacity to meet our customers future demand 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital or credit will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
while we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers  we may from time to time be at risk due to the adverse financial condition of one or more customers 
we have established procedures for the review and monitoring of the credit worthiness of our customers and or significant amounts owing from customers 
despite our monitoring and procedures  from time to time  especially in the current macroeconomic situation  we may find that  despite our efforts  one or more of our customers become insolvent or face bankruptcy proceedings 
such events could have an adverse effect on our operating results if our receivables applicable to that customer become uncollectible in whole or in part  or if our customers financial situation result in reductions in whole or in part of our ability to continue to sell our products or services to such customers at the same levels or at all 
large potential environmental liabilities or costs of compliance may adversely impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
however  we cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective or that issues with respect to these matters will not from time to time occur 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls  including the failure of human judgment 

table of contents under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
under other laws  we may be subject to fines and penalties if facilities or equipment are not operated in technical compliance with permit conditions or if required reports are not timely filed with applicable agencies 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
we have been subject to claims of governmental authorities and other third parties  and may continue to be in the future see note  environmental matters  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item 
further  we cannot assure you that changes in environmental laws or regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
additionally  if we were to divest additional facilities  such facilities may undergo further environmental review and investigation which may lead to previously unknown environmental liabilities 
while we intend to defend against any claim of liability in this area vigorously  any claim against us in this regard if resolved unfavorably  or any present or future failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations  could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to material risks  including risks under us export laws 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we maintain or contract with significant operations and equipment in foreign countries  including wafer fabrication  product assembly and testing 
among others  the following risks are inherent in doing business internationally changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  crime  kidnapping  war  terrorism  and foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  in certain jurisdictions where we use third party contractors  the legal systems do not provide effective remedies to us when the contractor has breached its obligation or otherwise fails to perform 
in addition  certain of our operations and products are subject to restrictions or licensing under us export laws 
if such laws or the implementation of these restrictions change  or if in the course of operating under such laws we become subject to claims  we cannot assure you that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and products may be greater in these foreign countries 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operating results as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in the future 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
for example  some of our manufacturing costs are denominated in british pound  mexican peso and other foreign currencies  and sales of our products are denominated in european union euro  japanese yen and other foreign currencies  and some property  plant and equipment purchases are denominated in japanese yen  european union euro  british pound and other foreign currencies 
consequently  movements in exchange rates could cause our net sales and expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful in reducing our foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

table of contents some of our facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines  flood zones or high brush fire danger areas 
our corporate headquarters  one of our manufacturing facilities  one of our key research facilities  one of key third party foundries and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
in addition  one of our major manufacturing facilities is located in a high brush fire danger area 
another major manufacturing facility is potentially susceptible to flood risk 
some of these facilities have been affected by earthquakes and brush fires in the past and may again be in the future 
we could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  flood or brush fire 
although we maintain insurance policies  we can give you no assurance that we have obtained or will maintain sufficient insurance coverage at levels and with such deductibles and limitations that would prevent a material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations 
certain general economic  regulatory and business factors not specific to the semiconductor industry that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be affected by a number of general economic and business factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include interest rates  recession  inflation  exchange rates  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  health care costs and governmental policy  tax rates and policy  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
unfavorable changes in any of these factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs or impose practical limits on pricing  any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our reported results can be affected adversely and unexpectedly by the implementation of new  or changes in the interpretation of existing  united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our financial reporting is subject to gaap  and gaap is subject to change over time 
if new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting  our reported results of operations and financial condition could be affected substantially  including requirements to restate historical financial reporting 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
natural disasters  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
natural disasters  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our ability to achieve revenues and our profitability 
in the past  our operations have been affected by a number of natural disasters  including  among other things  earthquakes  fires  volcanoes  hurricanes  and inclement weather  and may be affected by additional natural disasters in the future 
additionally  such events could delay or result in cancellation of domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains  and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products timely if at all

table of contents our manufacturing facilities in san jose  california and leominster  massachusetts are dedicated for use by the hirel segment 
with the exception of the facilities at these two locations  the rest of our fabrication and assembly facilities are shared by the pmd  esp  hirel  ep  and ap segments 
the ip segment generally operates out of our el segundo  california business office 
we believe our current facilities  supplemented by third party contract wafer fabrication and assembly capacity  are adequate for our visibility into our near term operating needs  however  we continue to take a number of actions to respond to what had been increased customer demand  including ongoing efforts to qualify external manufacturing sources and capital investments in our existing manufacturing operations 
at the end of fiscal year ended june   we operated at approximately percent  up from percent at the end of fiscal year ended june   of our worldwide in house wafer fabrication and assembly manufacturing capacities  without considering third party contract wafer fabrication or assembly capacity 
this increase in operating activity reflects the significant increase in demand for our products during the fiscal year ended june  over the prior fiscal year 
we initiated actions to consolidate certain of our manufacturing operations during our fiscal year 
those actions included the decision to consolidate our newport  wales wafer fabrication facilities and to close our el segundo  california wafer fabrication facility 
due to significant increases in demand  we reopened the portion of our fabrication facility in newport  wales which was closed in the consolidation and we suspended  for the foreseeable future  the closure of our el segundo  california wafer fabrication facility 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we adopted a plan for the closure of our oxted  england facility and our el segundo  california r d fabrication facility 
we have completed the closure of the oxted  england facility  and intend to sell the underlying real property 
as previously noted  the initiative to close the el segundo  california fabrication facility has been suspended for the foreseeable future  and the final shutdown and exit from el segundo  california research and development facility will likely not be completed until that time
