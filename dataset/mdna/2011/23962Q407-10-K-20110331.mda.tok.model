item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition 
you should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related footnotes 
this discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including those set forth in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we have developed a proprietary thin film deposition technology for solar photovoltaic pv products 
we utilize a proprietary one step sputter deposition process and have manufactured a commercial scale deposition tool to apply high efficiency copper indium gallium diselenide cigs material over large area glass substrates in a continuous fashion 
we believe this proprietary tool  when combined with commercially available thin film manufacturing equipment  will provide a critically differentiated manufacturing process to produce low cost monolithically integrated  cigs on glass modules that address the grid tied  ground based pv market 
we are pursuing a strategy to produce our cigs on glass modules utilizing offshore manufacturing 
we believe this proprietary deposition process  when operated at an annual capacity of approximately megawatts  will achieve a total module manufacturing cost of less than per watt 
this cost would be competitive with the lowest in the solar pv industry 
using this approach  we have achieved greater than cell efficiencies over large areas on cigs pv devices  and we believe that this approach will enable module efficiencies greater than 
in october  we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we have used these proceeds to develop our proprietary deposition process  to build our prototype and commercial scale deposition tools 
in the near term  we will require substantial funds beyond our current cash on hand in order to pursue a strategic partnership or partnerships to commercialize the cigs modules  to pursue offshore manufacturing  to fund future operations  and to expand our capacity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those accounting policies can be found in the notes to our financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments on the part of management about matters that are uncertain 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using straight line and an accelerated method over estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs  which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment  are charged to operations as incurred 
when property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of  the property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation and any resulting gain or loss is recognized 
share based compensation 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
additionally  we follow the sec s sab no 
 share based payment sab  as amended by sab no 
 which provides supplemental application guidance based on the views of the sec 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and certain reclassifications have been made to the financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no impact on net loss 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily due to the cost savings measures implemented including a 
table of contents reduction in our workforce as well as the consolidation of our facilities into one location in california and a reduction in expenditures for materials  supplies and consultants 
also  in july  we sold substantially all our tangible assets at our halfmoon  ny facility to veeco compound semiconductor  inc veeco for million and veeco hired the research and development employees located at the facility 
this transaction further reduced our research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared with the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to cost savings measures implemented  including a reduction in our workforce as well as a reduction in outside consultants and professional fees 
however  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was offset by an increase in share based compensation of  restructuring 
restructuring expenses were  for the year ended december  there were no restructuring expenses for the year ended december  in june  we were unable to cure all alleged defaults under the lease for our newark facility and on july   we were notified by our landlord that the lease for the facility was forfeited and terminated  and that the landlord received a judgment for possession of the premises 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge for the book value of the leasehold improvements for this facility and the write off of any non cash deferred rent  in the amount of  the remaining  of restructuring expenses resulted from impairment charges on certain equipment  which was partially offset by certain liability settlements during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
during the second quarter of  we consolidated our california facilities and recorded impairment charges on leasehold improvements and certain equipment which resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense 
also  we experienced a decrease in depreciable assets from the sale of the equipment at our halfmoon  ny facility in july which further reduced depreciation expense 
other expense 
other expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease primarily represents the loss recorded on the sale of the assets at our halfmoon ny facility in july  interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in interest expense was due to the interest on convertible notes issued in connection with our bridge financing 
amortization of note discount and financing costs 
amortization of note discount and financing costs was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the convertible notes issued in connection with our bridge financing contain conversion features which result in discounts to the principal amount of the notes payable reflected on our balance sheet  based on the fair value of the conversion features 
the discounts on the convertible notes are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the notes 
the increase in amortization of note discount and financing costs was due to an increase in the convertible notes during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   as well as a restructuring of the outstanding convertible notes during the third quarter of which resulted in an increase in the discount on the notes and a corresponding increase in amortization of the discount during the period 
gain on derivative liabilities 
gain on derivative liabilities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the conversion features on the convertible 
table of contents notes issued in conjunction with our bridge financing during and are considered derivative liabilities and are therefore required to be adjusted to fair value each quarter 
a decrease in our stock price during the period results in a decrease in the liabilities and a gain on derivative liabilities 
conversely  an increase in our stock price during the period would result in an increase in the liabilities and a loss on derivative liabilities 
during the year ended december   our common stock price decreased which caused a decrease in the fair value of the conversion features  resulting in a gain on derivative liabilities 
this decrease in stock price coupled with a significant increase in outstanding convertible notes in resulted in a significant increase in gain on derivative liabilities for the year ended december  as compared with additionally  during the third quarter of  we issued new convertible notes and the fair value of the conversion features for the new notes exceeded the principal amount the notes 
the excess of the fair value of the conversion features over the principal amount of the notes of  was charged to loss on derivative liabilities  which partially offset the gain on derivative liabilities during the period 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt was  for the year ended december  there was no loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  in the third quarter of  we restructured all of our existing convertible notes which resulted in the extinguishment of the original notes on our balance sheet and the recording of new notes and corresponding conversion features 
the fair value of the conversion features for the restructured notes exceeded the principal amount the notes and the excess of the fair value of the conversion features over the principal amount of the notes was charged to loss on extinguishment of debt 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december  we are in the development stage  and as such  have historically reported net losses  including a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss for the years ended december  and include non cash expenses of million and million  respectively 
we anticipate incurring losses in the future  as we complete the commercialization of our products  invest in research and development  and incur associated administrative and operating costs 
our financial statements for the years ended december  and have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
as noted herein  as a result of our current liquidity  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have historically financed our operations primarily from proceeds of the sale of equity securities and the issuance of convertible notes 
we presently do not have any bank lines of credit that provide us with an additional source of debt financing 
in order to fund the costs associated with our continued development and commercialization efforts  we completed a registered public offering during the fourth quarter of in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share and generated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and the fees and expenses of the offering 
upon receipt of the proceeds from the offering  we re paid in full million of existing indebtedness 
we have used these proceeds to develop our proprietary deposition process and to build our prototype and commercial scale deposition tools 
we are pursuing a strategy to commercialize and manufacture our cigs modules offshore and are in discussions with potential partners to implement this strategy 
commercialization efforts  including continued development and administrative costs will require significant additional capital 
beginning in september  we have funded our operations through a series of bridge financing transactions in which we have issued convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of  and also issued warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock 
currently   of these convertible notes remains outstanding and matures on april  
table of contents in order to address our immediate capital requirements  in february  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with socius cg ii  ltd 
the investor or socius 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we have the right over a term of two years  subject to certain conditions  to demand through separate tranche notices that the investor purchase up to a total of million of series b preferred stock 
however  in order to continue operations  including development and commercialization efforts  we will require substantial additional capital beyond our current cash on hand and any funds received from the socius transaction 
we are seeking long term strategic investments and partnerships to manufacture and commercialize our product 
to date  we have been unable to raise substantial additional capital or complete an agreement with a strategic partner 
although we continue to seek strategic investors or partners  in light of our current cash position  we may in the near term be forced to cease or further curtail operations 
an inability to raise additional funding in the very near term may cause us to file a voluntary petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code  liquidate assets  and or pursue other such actions that could adversely affect future operations 
a wide variety of factors relating to the company including those described in the section entitled risk factors in part i item a in this annual report on form k  as well as external conditions  could adversely affect our ability to secure additional funding necessary to continue operations and the terms of any funding that we secure 
commitments 
at december   we had no outstanding purchase orders for equipment and improvements 
other commitments include rental payments under operating leases for office space and equipment  and commitments under employment contracts with our executive officers 
these commitments are discussed further in the commitments and contingencies footnote to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the only off balance sheet obligations are for operating leases and certain other commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we lease  square feet of factory and office space in milpitas  california under a lease which expires in may this facility is the location of our corporate headquarters as well as the development of our products and proprietary deposition equipment
