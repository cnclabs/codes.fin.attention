the company s consolidated net income increased for the fiscal year ended march  to million as compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company s earnings were positively impacted by a decrease in the net charge off percentage to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the company believes the decrease in the charge off percentage was primarily attributable to the following factors the increased market value of auctioned cars  the continued application of stricter underwriting guidelines  and the continued allocation of additional resources focused on collections 
the consumer assistance to recycle and save act of cars established a voluntary vehicle trade in and purchase program pursuant to which owners of vehicles were eligible to receive a credit of either  or  in connection with the purchase of a new vehicle from a participating dealer  depending upon how the trade in and acquired vehicles fit within the program criteria  including the amount of improved fuel efficiency 
the program reduced the supply of used cars in the market  resulting in increases in the market value of used cars 
the company s underwriting guidelines were changed in to increase the minimum income required by any applicant before loan approval can even be contemplated 
the company also reduced the maximum advance to any dealer  raised the minimum enh beacon score  and reduced the maximum amount that can be financed 
as discussed in note interest rate swap agreements to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the company made an economic decision which resulted in undesignating the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march  under accounting rules this has introduced volatility to the statement of income for changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that historically have been captured in accumulated comprehensive income or loss in the statement of shareholders equity 
the company held the interest rate swaps through their entire terms and as of and since march  does not have any outstanding 
accordingly  over the term of each interest rate swap agreement  the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps  which are now recorded in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps line item of the statement of income  has offset to and cumulatively has no impact on retained earnings

critical accounting policy the company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses 
it is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is established through allocations of dealer discount and a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation considers  among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance 
because of the nature of the customers under the company s contracts and its direct loan program  the company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative 
the company segregates its contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses 
all contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool 
the company pools contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase contracts in different geographic markets 
this method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate 
the pools also allow the company to evaluate the different levels of customer income  stability and credit history  and the types of vehicles purchased in each market 
each such static pool consists of the contracts purchased by a branch office during the fiscal quarter 
contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual contract by contract basis 
individual contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of state maximum interest rates or the maximum interest rate which the customer will accept 
in certain markets  competitive forces will drive down contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual contract 
the company only buys contracts on an individual basis and never purchases contracts in batches  although the company may consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
the company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which contracts to purchase 
these guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all of the contracts that the company purchases to have common risk characteristics 
the company utilizes its district managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines 
the company also utilizes an internal audit department to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines 
the company utilizes the branch model  which allows for contract purchasing to be done on the branch level 
each branch manager may interpret the guidelines differently  and as a result  the common risk characteristics tend to be the same on an individual branch level but not necessarily compared to another branch 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable  net of unearned interest  of a contract  and the amount of money the company actually pays for the contract 
the discount negotiated by the company is a function of the credit quality of the customer  the wholesale value of the vehicle  and competition in any given market 
the automotive dealer accepts these terms by executing a dealer agreement with the company 
the entire amount of discount is related to credit quality and is considered to be part of the allowance for credit losses 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance 
a static pool retains an amount equal to of the discount as an allowance for credit losses 

table of contents subsequent to the purchase  if the reserve for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool which is not fully liquidated  then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to reestablish adequate reserves 
if a static pool is fully liquidated and has any remaining reserves  the excess discounts are immediately recognized into income and the excess provision is immediately reversed during the period 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are determined to have excess discounts  such excess amounts are accreted into income over the remaining life of the static pool 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are deemed to have excess reserves  such excess amounts are reversed against provision for credit losses during the period 
in analyzing a static pool  the company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the branch office  the performance of prior contracts purchased from the dealers whose contracts are included in the current static pool  the credit rating of the customers under the contracts in the static pool  and current market and economic conditions 
each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary

the company continues to evaluate reserve levels on a pool by pool basis during each reporting period 
while the company is encouraged with the decline in net charge offs and delinquency percentages for these periods  from a historical perspective  charge off rates and delinquencies remain high  leading to an increase in the overall allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables 
while unemployment rates have stabilized  they remain elevated which will make it difficult for additional improvement

income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher pretax income 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was an increase in the amount of taxable income subject to higher graduated tax rates associated with federal income taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are summarized as follows fiscal year ended march  cash provided by used in operations investing activities primarily purchase of contracts financing activities net decrease increase in cash the company s primary use of working capital during the fiscal year ended march  was the funding of the purchase of contracts which are financed substantially through borrowings under the company s line 
during  the company increased the size of the line and extended the maturity date to november  the line is secured by all of the assets of nicholas financial 
the company may borrow the lesser of million or amounts based upon formulas principally related to a percentage of eligible finance receivables  as defined 
borrowings under the line may be under various libor pricing options plus basis points with a floor on libor or at the prime rate 
prime rate based borrowings are generally less than million 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the line was approximately million and the amount available under the line was approximately million 
the company will continue to depend on the availability of the line  together with cash from operations  to finance future operations 
amounts outstanding under the line have increased by approximately million and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the growth of the line is principally related to funding the purchase of contracts and is consistent with the growth of finance receivables 
the amount of debt the company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the line 
the company believes that borrowings available under the line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term funding needs 
the line requires compliance with certain debt covenants including financial ratios  asset quality and other performance tests 
the company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants but  during the current economic slowdown  a breach of one or more of these covenants could occur prior to the maturity date of the line  which is november  the company s consortium of lenders could place the company in default if certain covenants were breached and take one or more of the following actions increase the company s borrowing costs  restrict the company s ability to obtain additional borrowings under the line  accelerate all amounts outstanding under the line  or enforce its interests against collateral securing the line 
the company believes its lenders will continue to allow it to operate in the event of a condition of default  however no assurance can be given that this would occur 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  each of which effectively converts a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on the company s interest expense 
as of march   all swap agreements have matured 
approximately company s borrowings under the line were subject to interest rate swap agreements as of march  the decrease is attributable to management s ongoing evaluation of interest rate swap agreements necessary to meet the company s objective to minimize the cost of borrowings in light of current and expected future interest rates under the line 
impact of inflation the company is affected by inflation primarily through increased operating costs and expenses including increases in interest rates 
inflationary pressures on operating costs and expenses have been offset by the company s continued emphasis on stringent operating and cost controls
