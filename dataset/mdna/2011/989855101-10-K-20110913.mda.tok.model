item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  discontinued operations and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  discontinued operations  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb pertaining to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return for defective products that we account for as a warranty provision under authoritative guidance of accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and related authoritative guidance 
standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
certain customer transactions include payment terms whereby we receive a partial payment of the total order amount prior to the related sale being recognized in our financial statements 
these advance payments are included in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet 
generally  these progress payments relate to orders for custom equipment that require a lengthy build cycle and  in some cases  acceptance by the customer 
we may negotiate payment terms with these customers on these particular orders and secure certain payments prior to or on shipment of the equipment 
these payments remain in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue until our applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from our customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
discontinued operations the company classifies operations as discontinued when the operations have either ceased  or are expected to be disposed of in a sale transaction in the near term and the operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been eliminated or will be eliminated upon consummation of the expected sale transaction and the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the discontinued operations 
authoritative guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires the calculation of estimated fair value less cost to sell long lived assets for assets held for sale 
the calculation of estimated fair value less cost to sell includes significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to operating projections  discount rate  excess working capital levels  property values  and the anticipated costs involved in the selling process 
as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  we have discontinued the singapore ic packaging operations of our vision systems product line  which was included in our metrology solutions segment 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage  over a reasonable period of time  is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments affecting earnings may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been primarily classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
we also have certain securities that are classified as trading 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with authoritative guidance pertaining to share based payment using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the determination of these assumptions is based on history and future expectations and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred together with specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
a one percent change in warranty liability would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
authoritative guidance issued by the fasb pertaining to accounting for income taxes requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  management determined that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  and an adjustment to record a full valuation allowance was charged to income tax expense 
the company maintains the valuation allowance at june  should management determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes to the valuation allowance  changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the fasb pertaining to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses and a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge on property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge on goodwill 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges on property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and marketable securities 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
a five percent change in actual claims would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview zygo corporation is a worldwide supplier of optical metrology instruments  precision optics and electro optical design and manufacturing services  serving customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and industrial markets 
optical instruments products encompass non contact optical measurement instruments 
optics products consist of high performance macro optics components  optical coatings and optical system assemblies 
we conduct the majority of our manufacturing in our  square foot facility in middlefield  connecticut  our  square foot facility in richmond  california and a  square foot leased facility in tucson  arizona 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed a transaction with asml us  inc asml to purchase substantially all the assets of asml s richmond  california operation  including a  square foot manufacturing facility 
the assets were acquired for million in cash and future consideration with a net present value of million  based on the projected level of shipments to asml over the next three years beginning january  in addition  we hired key management and employees working at the former asml richmond facility and formed our extreme precision optics group epo  which is included in our optical systems segment 
with this acquisition  we have considerably expanded our optical manufacturing capabilities 
combined with our existing leadership position in metrology  large flat optics production and electro optical design and manufacturing  epo provides highly synergistic capabilities that address new applications in semiconductor  defense and the life sciences markets 
the fair value of the richmond assets acquired was greater than the purchase price  resulting in a gain on acquisition of million which was recorded in other income 
in addition  a deferred tax liability of million was recorded in the opening balance sheet  which had the effect of reducing the gain on acquisition to million 
the fair value of the assets was determined based on management s review of the value of the assets at the time of the acquisition 
our revenues increased in fiscal from fiscal and our earnings per diluted share increased to in fiscal from a loss of per diluted share in fiscal fiscal results include a gain on acquisition of per diluted share  net of tax 
fiscal results include the impact of i costs for the acquisition of zemetrics  including the charge relating to the impairment of goodwill as part of the purchase price valuation  ii the company s evaluation of an unsolicited stock offer  iii search cost for a new chief executive officer and iv inventory adjustments 
the net effect of these charges was to reduce net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal by million  or per diluted share 
our fiscal results reflected strong revenue growth in both our segments 
the revenue growth in the optical systems segment included revenues from epo  which we established in fiscal our backlog at june  was million  an increase of million from june  net bookings were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal net bookings for the fourth quarter from the metrology solutions segment accounted for of the bookings received  the optical systems segment accounted for the remaining 
for fiscal  bookings were million  an increase of over fiscal as a result of increased activity across all product lines resulting from our continued product and market diversification and the strength in our markets  as well as the addition of epo 
we have assessed the impact on our business resulting from the earthquake  tsunami and nuclear disaster in japan and do not believe that these events have had nor will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or continuing operations 
our activities in japan resumed full operation shortly after the events 
indications at this time are that shipments both into japan and from our japanese operation will not be seriously affected 
in addition  to date  our supply chain has been unaffected by the events in japan 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues by segment year ended dollars in millions june  june  amount percentage of total amount percentage of total metrology solutions optical systems total revenues for fiscal increased compared with the prior year period  reflecting increases in the metrology solutions segment revenues of and the increase in optical systems segment revenue of 
the increase in the metrology solutions segment revenues was primarily due to volume increases in instruments of million and lithography stage metrology of million 
the increase in instruments was due to volume increases in large aperture and microscope products 
we generated revenue increases across all our regions 
large aperture revenues were especially strong in the americas and china included in our pacific rim geographic region 
the increase in lithography stage metrology is due to strength in the semiconductor market 
the increase in the optical systems segment revenues was primarily due to revenues of million generated by epo since the formation of the group in the second quarter of fiscal we also generated increases in contract manufacturing of million and precision optics of million 
the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was due to higher helmet mounted display unit volumes which more than offset declines in laser vision systems and dental wands 
approximately of all fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars  compared with in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the revenues of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets

during fiscal  we also recognized of tax benefit from the adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets associated with the richmond asset purchase 
the deferred tax liability recorded in connection with the gain on acquisition reduced our net deferred tax assets which  in turn  reduced our valuation allowance 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as a current period tax benefit 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of june  in future periods  the valuation allowance could be reduced based upon sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during fiscal  we were also able to realize an income tax benefit for refund claims associated with nol carryforwards and research and development credits due to changes in the united states tax regulations 
in addition  we realized a benefit from the reversal of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as such positions were settled in fiscal these income tax benefits were partially offset by income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and state income taxes in the united states

new business in the metrology solutions segment related to oem heads increased revenues by million 
the decrease in display solution revenues was due to the arrangement entered into with toho technology corporation toho in october the volume decreases in instruments and lithography revenues  in large measure  were due to a reduction in bookings that appeared to be tied directly to the general global economic downturn  most notably in the semiconductor industry 
a decrease in bookings from canon accounted for the majority of the decrease in lithography revenues 
the increase in the optical systems segment revenues was primarily due to increases in optical component revenues of million 
approximately of all fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars  compared with in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the revenues of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets

at june  and  there was in the aggregate million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall liquidity include capital expenditures  customer credit requirements  investments in businesses and the availability of bank lines of credit 
fiscal compared with fiscal at june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  an increase of million from million at june   of which million is located in foreign jurisdictions subject to repatriation restrictions

as of june   million of standby letters of credit were outstanding 
these letters of credit are used primarily overseas to cover certain warranty periods or to cover future product shipments 
these letters of credit are expected to expire at varying dates through january the cash equivalents balance in our money market account  which is invested primarily in us government securities  was million as of june  we do not believe there is any risk to liquidity in the money market account  nor are there currently any limits on redemptions 
cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended june  of million was primarily due to an increase in net earnings  excluding non cash items  partially offset by an increase in receivables and inventories 
cash flow used by investing activities for the year ended june  increased by million compared with the prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to the purchase of asml s richmond  california assets for million and a net decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
cash flow provided by financing activities in the year ended june  of million was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by dividend payments of million to noncontrolling interests 
we currently have no debt or lines of credit 
in the future  if the need for debt or credit lines arose  there is no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing 
we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility and cash reserves to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
fiscal compared with fiscal at june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  an increase of million from million at june  our marketable security consisted of million in a united states treasury bill as security for bank guarantees and standby letters of credit

we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents consisting of an institutional money market fund and marketable securities consisting primarily of a government agency security and mutual fund 
the institutional money market fund  with a balance of million  consists primarily of us treasury securities 
the million government agency security consists of a us government treasury bill 
the mutual fund of million  which is related to our deferred compensation program  consists of corporate securities 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
there is little downward exposure on our interest income 
to the extent interest rates increase or we change our investment strategy  there could be an increase in investment income 
the table below presents investment amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in dollars in millions thereafter marketable securities fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate marketable securities fair market value sensitivity we have reviewed current investment ratings  company specific events and general economic conditions in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included bookings in us dollars of million  or  of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our net revenues that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the japanese yen and euro 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
