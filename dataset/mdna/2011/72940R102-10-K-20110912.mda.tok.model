item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  through june   we have not generated any revenues  and as of such date we have negative cash flow from operations of  and have accumulated a deficit of  since our inception in may this negative cash flow is mostly attributable to research and development and general and administrative expenses 
research and development net research and development net costs costs less participation and grants by the ocs and other parties  for the year ended june  increased by to  from  for the year ended june  this increase is mainly due to the increase in our research and development activities during the fiscal year  and more specifically is attributed to the increase in our stock based compensation expenses and our salaries and lab materials expenses including hiring new employees since june this increase is partially offset by a grant from the us government  which was received and recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year  in the amount of  general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  from  for the year ended june  this increase is mainly due to an increase in stock based compensation expenses related to our employees and consultants 
financial income  net financial income increased from an expense of  for the year ended june  to income of  for the year ended june  the increase in the financial income is due to interest income on bank deposits which increased as our cash balance materially increased over the past fiscal year 
net loss net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to net loss of  for the year ended june  net loss per share for the year ended june  was  as compared to for the year ended june  the net loss per share decreased as a result of the increase in our weighted average number of shares due to the issuance of additional shares pursuant to equity issuances since july  as discussed further below 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   total current assets were  and total current liabilities were  on june   we had a working capital surplus of  and an accumulated deficit of  we finance our operations and plan to continue doing so with issuances of securities  grants from the ocs and other parties and most recently also from licensing our technology 
cash and cash equivalents as of june  amounted to  this is an increase of  from the  reported as of june  cash balances increased in the year ended june  for the reasons presented below operating activities used cash of  in the year ended june  cash used by operating activities in the year ended june  primarily consisted of payments of salaries to our employees  and payments of fees to our consultants  subcontractors and professional services providers including costs of the clinical studies  less research and development grants by the ocs and other parties 
investing activities used cash of  in the year ended june  the investing activities consisted primarily of repayments of short term deposits  offset by investments in equipment for our r d facilities and construction of a new research lab 
financing activities generated cash in the amount of  during the year ended june  substantially all of such amount is attributable to offerings we closed in october and february and exercise of warrants  as follows on october   we closed an offering pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price per share of 
no separate consideration was paid for the warrants 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable starting six months following the issuance thereof 
the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the shares and the warrants were approximately  on february   we closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of  units  with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants sold in the offering are exercisable for a period of five years commencing six months following issuance  at an exercise price of per share 
also  on february  we closed the exercise by the underwriters of their full overallotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the aggregate net proceeds to us were approximately million 
during january june  a total of  warrants were exercised via a cashless manner  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock to our investors 
in addition  warrants were exercised and resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock by our investors 
the aggregate cash consideration received was during the year that ended june  and we received approximately  and  from the ocs towards our r d expenses  respectively 
we adhere to an investment policy set by our investment committee which aims to preserve our financial assets  maintain adequate liquidity and maximize return 
such policy further provides that we should hold the vast majority of our current assets in bank deposits and the remainder of our current assets is to be invested in government bonds and a combination of corporate bonds and relatively low risk stocks 
as of today  the currency of our financial portfolio is mainly in usd and we use forward and options contracts in order to hedge our exposures to currencies other than the usd 
outlook we do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of products in the next twelve months 
our products will likely not be ready for sale for at least three years  if at all 
we expect to generate revenues  which in the short and medium terms will unlikely exceed our costs of operations  from sale of licenses to use our technology or products  as we have in the license agreement we entered into in august with united 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly during fiscal year this is mainly attributable to the anticipated phase ii and phase ii iii clinical trials  constructing a clinical manufacturing facility and developing capabilities for new clinical indications of plx cells 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses to continue in fiscal year at similar levels as they were in fiscal year the ocs has supported our activity in the past five years 
our last program approved by the ocs was for the period march until february in march  we filed an application for a sixth year program 
there is no assurance that the ocs will approve a grant for another year r d activity 
the amount of the grant is also not certain 
in addition the european authorities approved a research grant under the european commission s seventh framework program fp in the amount of approximately  for a period of years which began on january  we believe that giving our current business development plan  the funds we have will be sufficient for operating until approximately the end of fiscal year of however  our management believes that it is likely that we will need to raise additional funds before we have positive cash flow from operations 
we may raise funds from time to time to support our ongoing capital needs  or if we choose to expand or accelerate our clinical programs or develop new products 
we look for sources of funding  including non diluting sources such as licensing fees and ocs grants 
we have an effective shelf registration statement which we have used in recent public offerings we made and may continue to use in the future to raise additional funds  subject to certain limitations based on our size 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the company consolidated income statements 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of its awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of each of the awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are  expected stock price volatility  and the expected option term 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date 
the expected life of options granted is calculated using the simplified method  as defined in staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 share based payments  or sab no 
 as the average between the vesting period and the contractual life of the options 
on december  the sec staff issued sab no 
 or sab  which  effective january   amends and replaces sab no 

we currently use the simplified method  as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
we adopted sab effective january  and will continue to apply the simplified method until enough historical experience is available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for stock option grants 
we have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to distribute dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate affects the number of exercisable options 
based on our historical experience  the pre vesting forfeiture rate per grant is for the options and shares granted to employees and for the options and shares granted to directors and officers of our company 
in accordance with asc  restricted shares or restricted shares units are measured at their fair value as if they were vested and issued on the grant date 
all restricted shares and restricted shares units to employees and non employees granted in and were granted for no consideration or for a voluntary reduction in cash compensation  therefore their fair value was equal to the share price at the date of grant 
the fair value of all restricted shares and restricted shares units was determined based on the close trading price of our shares known at the grant date 
we apply asc and asc eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  with respect to options and warrants issued to non employees 
asc requires the use of option valuation models to measure the fair value of the options and warrants at the measurement date 
stock based compensation is considered critical accounting policy due to the significant expenses of options  restricted stock and restricted stock units which were granted to our employees  directors and consultants 
stock based compensation expenses that were recorded in fiscal year amounted to  research and development expenses  net we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to consultants and subcontractors such as research organizations  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the costs and expenses of our research and development activity are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
the grant is deducted from research and development expenses at the time we are entitled to such grant  on the basis of the cost incurred 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements our company has no off balance sheet arrangements
