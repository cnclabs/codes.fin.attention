item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation  a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists worldwide working in biological life sciences research 
sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis 
sample preparation is often complex  time consuming  and one of the most error prone steps of scientific research 
it is  none the less  a ubiquitous laboratory undertaking the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market 
we have developed and patented a novel  enabling technology platform that can control the sample preparation process 
it is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic pressure 
this process  called pressure cycling technology pct  uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra high levels  psi or greater to safely  conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples eg  cells and tissues from human  animal  plant  and microbial sources 
our pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra high levels at controlled temperatures to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio molecules 
our instrument  the barocycler  and our internally developed consumables product line  which includes pressure used to lyse samples for extraction pulse tubes as well as application specific kits which include consumable products and reagents together make up the pct sample preparation system pct sps 
we have experienced negative cash flows from continuing operations since the inception of our pct business  and these losses are expected to continue over at least the next twelve months 
as of december   we had a total cash balance of approximately  including  of restricted cash 
as of march   we had available cash of  and  of restricted cash which  based on current projections  will be sufficient to fund operations into april as a result  the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  states that the auditing firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at december  to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve month period  and if in that case sufficient cash cannot be obtained  we would have to substantially alter  or possibly even discontinue  operations 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we are currently attempting to raise additional capital 
additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
in the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities  which could harm our business 
the accompanying financial statements do not include adjustments that may be required in the event of the disposal of assets or the discontinuation of the business  obtain financing with terms that may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital stock  or obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all of our technologies or products 
our pressure cycling technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad applications in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas  including sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies  pathogen inactivation  protein purification  control of chemical enzymatic reactions  and immunodiagnostics 
since we began operations as pressure biosciences in february  we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies 
our business strategy is to commercialize pressure cycling technology in the area of sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies sample preparation 
we also plan to pursue the further development and commercialization of pct in other life sciences applications  which could include working with various strategic partners that have greater scientific  and regulatory  expertise in the respective applications than we do 
we plan to focus primarily on the application of pct enhanced protein digestion for the mass spectrometry market and the advantages of pct in this market  and the use of pct in biomarker discovery  soil and plant biology  counter bio terror and tissue pathology applications 
to support our current strategy  our primary focus is the execution of our commercialization plan for pct in sample preparation 
we remain focused on projects that we feel represent near term revenue opportunities 
if we are successful commercializing our technology in the sample preparation market  we believe that our financial results will be positively affected by a combination of the revenue from the sale  lease  and rental of the barocycler instruments  the sale of other pct equipment  such as the pct shredder  and by the recurring revenue streams that we hope to realize from the sale of the single use pulse tubes  pct dependent kits  and extended service contracts on our instrumentation 
we believe the recurring revenue streams that could be generated from our instruments in the field is a very important component of our future financial success 
therefore  we believe that it is important for us to continue to focus on increasing the number of installed barocyclers in the field 
to this end  we have offered our prospective customers the opportunity to lease or rent the barocycler instruments  and in some cases we have engaged in short term reagent rental agreements 
under a reagent rental agreement we provide the customer with a barocycler instrument in exchange for a minimum purchase commitment of consumable products 
while these arrangements do not provide us with the immediate revenue of a sale  they do serve to expand the utilization of pct and they provide a stream of revenue in the form of rental payments and consumable purchases 
we define sales  leases  and rentals of barocycler instruments as revenue generating installations 
we also derive revenues from small business innovation research sbir grants awarded to us by the national institutes of health nih 
these types of grants allow us to bill the federal agency for work that we are planning to perform as part of the development and commercialization of our technology 
additionally  when our work in nih sbir phase i grants has been successful  then we have applied for larger nih sbir phase ii grants 
to date we have been awarded two nih phase i grants and one sbir phase ii grant 
both of our nih sbir phase i grants have been completed 
the data on one of the phase i grants was the basis for the submission  and subsequent award  of our nih sbir phase ii award of approximately  the nih sbir phase ii grant is for work in the area of the use of pct to extract protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles  with the expectation that these studies will ultimately lead to the release of a new  commercially available pct based system  with validated protocols  end user kits  and other consumables intended for the extraction of clinically important protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles 
as of december   the phase ii sbir grant had been completed 
in march  the us army medical research acquisition activity usamraa awarded us an sbir i grant for approximately  the grant had a term of six months 
we completed the work on the grant in october we completed our series a private placement and the first tranche of our series b private placement in  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  together with warrants  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of  we also closed the sale of a second tranche of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants in the series b private placement on march  with gross proceeds of on march   we exercised our right to call the month preferred stock warrants and  as a result month preferred stock warrants to purchase  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were exercised at per share  for gross proceeds to us of  before deducting associated expenses 
month preferred stock warrants to purchase an additional  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were exercised on a cashless basis  resulting in the net issuance of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to revenue we had total revenue of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
pct products  services  other 
revenue from the sale of pct products and services was  in as compared to  in increased rental income  higher average selling prices  and supporting equipment sales offset the lower number of pct installations in the current period 
we generated consumable sales of  for the year ended december  compared to  during the prior year  an increase of  or 
our domestic and foreign installations of pct systems are set forth in the table below 
unit installations domestic international total installations we expect the number of units installed will increase in future periods as we continue to gain commercial awareness of our technology  although we may experience some delays in customer purchases due to current economic conditions in the united states and globally 
we continue to expect that some portion of future installations will be for the smaller  lower priced  barocycler nep model and some will be placed under lease or short term rental agreements 
therefore  we expect that the average revenue per installation may continue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to drive our installed base and commercialize pct 
we also expect that as we continue to expand the installed base of barocycler instruments in the field  we will realize increasing revenue from the sale of consumable products and extended service contracts 
in the short term  these recurring revenue streams may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
grant revenue 
during  we recorded  of grant revenue as compared to  in grant revenue recorded during was related to the  sbir phase ii grant that we were awarded in june and to an sbir phase i grant of approximately  awarded in march we completed work on both grants in the fourth quarter of cost of pct products and services the cost of pct products and services was  for the year ended december   compared to  in our gross profit margin on pct products and services increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the increase in the gross profit margin on pct products and services was due primarily to sales of barocycler units to our international distributors at distributor discounted prices in the prior year and increased rental rates this year on barocycler leases 
the relationship between the cost of pct products and services and pct revenue will depend greatly on the mix of instruments we sell  the quantity of such instruments  and the mix of consumable products that we sell in a given period 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to  during from  in an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased costs relating to work on the sbir phase ii grant 
research and development expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation in and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to marketing activities  recruiting efforts of sales personnel and compensation for a new sales director 
selling and marketing expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative costs totaled  in the year ended december   as compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase is principally due to the expenses of patent filings and investor relations activities offset by stock option vesting occurring in the prior year 
during the years ended december  and  general and administrative expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the year ended december  includes a grant of stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in total to our employees and our four independent directors  resulting in a charge of  during the year ended december  also includes a one time charge of  of non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of a non qualified  fully vested option to purchase  shares of our common stock to our new independent director 
we awarded fully vested options to purchase  shares of our common stock to each of our two new independent directors in for a one time charge of  operating loss our operating loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the comparable period in  an increase of  or 
the additional operating loss resulted primarily because of the factors noted above 
interest income interest income totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower average cash balances and lower yields on these balances during the year ended december   as compared to therapeutic discovery credit in november  the company was awarded a  grant under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program under the patient protection and affordable care act of ppaca 
income taxes the benefit of  that was realized in relates to new legislation within the housing assistance tax act of which provided the company the option to claim a refundable tax credit in exchange for foregoing bonus depreciation 
in the year ended december   we recorded a refund of income taxes of  due to provisions in the american recovery and reinvestment act of relating to net operating loss carry backs 
the cash was received in august net loss during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  or per share  as compared to  or per share in the difference between net loss applicable to common shareholders and net loss relates to the beneficial conversion calculation associated with the intrinsic value of the series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the computation of loss per share heading 
liquidity and financial condition as of december   our working capital position was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses  and deposits  partially offset by accounts payable  accrued employee compensation  and other accrued expenses 
as of december   our working capital balance was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  income taxes receivable  prepaid expenses  and deposits 
we expect to continue to fund our operations from our working capital balance 
on february   we completed a private placement  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  units the series a units for a purchase price of per unit the series a purchase price  resulting in gross proceeds to us of  the series a private placement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further description of the series a convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in the series a private placement 
on november   we sold an aggregate of  units the series b units of series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share the series b convertible preferred stock and warrants for a purchase price of per series b unit the series b purchase price  resulting in gross proceeds to us of  with offering costs of  this is the first tranche of a million private placement the series b private placement 
we closed on the second tranche of the series b private placement on march  with the sale of an additional  series b units for a purchase price of per unit with gross proceeds of  netting to  after offering costs 
each series b unit consists of i one share of a newly created series b convertible preferred stock  convertible into shares of our common stock and ii a warrant to purchase one share of series b convertible preferred stock at an exercise price equal to per share for the warrants issued in november and at an exercise price of per share for the warrants issued in march  in each case with a term expiring on august  series b warrant 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of the series b convertible preferred stock and series b warrants issued in the series b private placement 
in connection with the series b private placement  we paid a finder s fee of  plus warrants to purchase  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at per share  expiring august  on march   we exercised our right to call the month preferred stock warrants and  as a result month preferred stock warrants to purchase  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were exercised at per share  for gross proceeds to us of  before deducting associated expenses 
month preferred stock warrants to purchase an additional  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were exercised on a cashless basis  resulting in the net issuance of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
we will need substantial additional capital to fund our current operations beyond the first quarter of in the event that we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to further limit or cease our operations  pursue a plan to sell our operating assets  or otherwise modify our business strategy  which could materially harm our future business prospects 
if we are able to obtain additional capital or otherwise increase our revenues  we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs 
net cash used in operations during was  as compared to net cash used in operations of  during the increase in cash used in operations in as compared to is principally due to an increase in barocycler inventory of  and an increase in operating loss of  excluding stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities during was  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  in the prior year 
during the year ended december   we purchased a barocycler skin mold and installed barocycler instruments under collaboration or lease agreements while selling several demonstration units 
cash used in investing activities during was for barocycler instruments that we purchased and installed under collaboration or lease agreements 
net cash provided by financing activities during was  we closed the second tranche of the series b private placement on march  with the sale of an additional  series b units with net proceeds of  several stock options were exercised for a total of  given to the company 
we gross proceeds to us of  before deducting associated expenses  in connection with the call and related exercise of the month preferred stock warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included a stock warrant exercise and the net proceeds of million from the sale of series a and b convertible preferred stock 
commitments and contingencies royalty commitments in  we acquired our initial equity interest in bioseq  inc  which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology 
bioseq  inc acquired its pressure cycling technology from biomolecular assays  inc bma under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement 
in  we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of bioseq  inc  and at such time  the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay bma a royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that bioseq  inc acquired from biomolecular assays  inc 
we are also required to pay bma of the proceeds from any sale  transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology 
these payment obligations terminate in during the year ended december  and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively in royalty expense associated with our obligation to bma 
in connection with our acquisition of bioseq  inc  we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to bma 
this license is non exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by bma solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development 
bma is required to pay us a royalty equal to of any license or other fees and royalties  but not including research support and similar payments  it receives in connection with any sale  assignment  license or other transfer of any rights granted to bma under the license 
bma must pay us these royalties until the expiration of the patents held by bioseq  inc in  which we anticipate will be we have not received any royalty payments from bma under this license 
battelle memorial institute in december  we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the battelle memorial institute battelle 
the licensed technology is described in the patent application filed by battelle on july  us serial number 
this application includes subject matter related to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples  including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter period of time than current methods  while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we paid battelle a non refundable initial fee of  in addition to royalty payments on net sales on licensed products  we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology 
the minimum royalty and our only obligation for was  target discovery inc in march  we signed a strategic product licensing  manufacturing  co marketing  and collaborative research and development agreement with target discovery inc tdi 
under the terms of the agreement  we have been licensed by tdi to manufacture and sell a highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis tdi reagents 
the tdi reagents were designed for use in combination with our pressure cycling technology 
the companies believe that the combination of pct and the tdi reagents can fill an existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid extraction and recovery of intact  functional proteins associated with cell membranes in tissue samples 
purchase commitments on december   we submitted a purchase order to source scientific  llc  the manufacturer of the company s pct barocycler instrumentation  for barocycler nep units and barocycler nep units with various spare parts 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  we placed a deposit with source scientific  llc  of approximately  representing approximately of the expected total value of the order 
the purchase price for the nep units and nep units is based upon a fixed bill of materials 
we were billed for the unpaid purchase price of each unit at the time each unit was completed and ready for sale 
as of december   we had received all units under this purchase order 
severance and change of control agreements each of our executive officers is entitled to receive a severance payment if terminated by the company without cause 
the severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of each executive officer s annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off 
additionally  each executive officer will be entitled to receive medical and dental insurance coverage for one year following the date of termination 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
each of our executive officers  other than mr 
richard t 
schumacher  our president and chief executive officer  is entitled to receive a change of control payment in an amount equal to one year of such executive officer s annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and medical and dental coverage  in the event of a change of control of the company 
in the case of mr 
schumacher  this payment would be equal to two years of annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and two years of medical and dental coverage 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
the severance payment is meant to induce the executive to become an employee of the company and to remain in the employ of the company  in general  and particularly in the occurrence of a change in control 
lease commitments we lease building space under non cancelable leases in south easton  ma and in the venture development center at the university of massachusetts in boston 
following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  year ending december thereafter total minimum payments required critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of pressure biosciences  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary pbi bioseq  inc 
use of estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  deferred tax assets  the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell  and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our current instruments  the barocycler nep and nep  require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set up for initial operation 
to support a favorable first experience for our customers  we send a highly trained technical representative to the customer site to install every barocycler that we sell  lease  or rent through our domestic sales force 
the installation process includes uncrating and setting up the instrument  followed by introductory user training 
product revenue related to current barocycler instrumentation is recognized upon the completion of the installation and introductory training process of the instrumentation at the customer location  for domestic and foreign installations 
product revenue related to sales of pct instrumentation to our foreign distributors is recognized upon shipment through a common carrier 
we provide for the expected costs of warranty upon the recognition of revenue for the sales of our instrumentation 
our sales arrangements do not provide our customers with a right of return 
product revenue related to our consumable products such as pulse tubes  microtubes  and application specific kits is recorded upon shipment through a common carrier 
shipping costs are included in sales and marketing expense 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
in accordance with fasb asc  leases  we account for our lease agreements under the operating method 
we record revenue over the life of the lease term and we record depreciation expense on a straight line basis over the thirty six month estimated useful life of the barocycler instrument 
the depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included in the cost of pct products and services line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
many of our lease and rental agreements allow the lessee to purchase the instrument at any point during the term of the agreement with partial or full credit for payments previously made 
we pay all maintenance costs associated with the instrument during the term of the leases 
revenue from government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award 
our transactions sometimes involve multiple elements ie  products and services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with fasb asc multiple element arrangements 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
we provide certain customers with extended service contracts and  to the extent vsoe is established  these service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
intangible assets we have classified as intangible assets  costs associated with the fair value of certain assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over sixteen years 
we annually review our intangible assets for impairment 
when impairment is indicated  any excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss 
an impairment analysis of intangible assets as of december  concluded they were not impaired 
long lived assets and deferred costs in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows related to the long lived assets 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
while our current and historical operating losses and cash flow are indicators of impairment  we performed an impairment analysis at december  and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
recent accounting standards the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to allow the use of companies estimated selling prices as the value for deliverable elements under certain circumstances and to eliminate the use of the residual method for allocation of deliverable elements 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu fair value measurements and disclosures asu 
asu updated section asc to require a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosure about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measures which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company determined that there is no significant impact to its operations from this guidance because the company invests in assets considered to be in level status
