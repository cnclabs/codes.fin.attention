item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation production and reserve information 
company reserve estimates our proved reserve information as of december  included in this annual report on form k was estimated by netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai  independent petroleum engineers 
a copy of nsai s summary reserve report is included as exhibit to this annual report on form k 
see note supplemental oil and gas reserve information unaudited to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in accordance with sec guidelines  nsai s estimates of future net revenues from our properties  and the pre tax present value of discounted future net cash flows pv and standardized measure thereof  were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions  which requires the use of the month average price for each product  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic a verage of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
the tables below set forth information as of december  with respect to our estimated proved reserves  the associated present value of discounted future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
neither the pv nor the after tax standardized measure is intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own 
the average prices weighted by production over the lives of the proved reserves used in the reserve report were 
table of contents per mcf of gas and per bbl of oil 
all of our proved undeveloped reserves became uneconomic at these prices and as a result were not included in the december  reserve estimates 
all of our proved reserves are located within the state of utah 
mcf of gas bbls of oil total mcfe total proved reserve quantities proved undeveloped proved developed total present value of discounted future net cash flows a a present value of discounted future net cash flows represents the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs  using the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  without giving effect to derivative transactions  and were held constant throughout the life of the properties 
the average prices weighted by production over the lives of the proved reserves used in the reserve report were of per mcf of gas and per bbl of oil 
all of our proved undeveloped reserves became uneconomic at these prices and as a result were not included in the d ecember  reserve estimates 
these prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the pv amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
non gaap present value reconciliation management uses discounted future net cash flows  which is calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses  and the present value thereof as one measure of the value of the company s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes 
we also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways 
while future net revenue and present value are based on prices  costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company 
the pv reserve measurement is considered to be a non gaap financial measure  however as of december   the pv and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are equal because the effects of estimated future in come tax expenses are zero

the other technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
we also maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with nsai to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to nsai in their reserves estimation process 
in the fourth quarter  our technical team meets regularly with representatives of nsai to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in nsai s preparation of the year end reserves estimates 
while we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process  a preliminary copy of the nsai reserve report is reviewed by our audit committee with representatives of nsai and internal technical staff 
additionally  our senior management reviews and approves any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis 
reserve technologies proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
to achieve reasonable certainty  nsai employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved

in certain leases  our ownership is not the same for all depths  therefore  the net acres in these leases are calculated using the greatest ownership interest at any depth 
generally this greater interest represents our ownership in the primary objective formation

as of december   approximately of the gross acreage that we hold is located on federal lands and approximately of the acreage is located on state lands 
it has been our experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands 
we have generally been able to obtain state permits within days  while obtaining federal permits has taken approximately months or longer 
if we are delayed in procuring sufficient drilling permits for our federal properties  we will shift more of our drilling in utah to our state leases 
while such a shift in resources would not necessarily affect the rate of growth of our cash flow  it would result in a slower growth rate of our total proved reserves  because a higher percentage of the wells drilled on the state leases will be drilled on leases to which proved undeveloped reserves may already have been attributed 
additionally  if the development of our acreage located on federal lands is delayed significantly by the permitting process  we may have to operate at a loss for an extended period of time 
such delays could result in impairments of the carrying value of our unproved properties and could impact the ceiling test calculation 
during we reclassified approximately  of unproved acreage costs primarily in utah into proved property 
this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further and a reduction in the carrying value of our acreage based on an independent acreage appraisal as of december  after this impairment  the aggregate carrying value of our unproved acreage is approximately  as of december  drilling activity the following table sets forth our drilling activity during the years ended december   and as of december   we had no wells in progress

riverbend thereafter undertook a more detailed assessment  which confirmed that riverbend had not obtained certain air permits nor complied with certain air pollution regulatory programs that were applicable to its operations at the riverbend compressor station 
on june   riverbend sent a letter to the united states environmental protection agency epa region office in denver  colorado  which because the riverbend compressor station is located i n indian country is the agency that has jurisdiction over federal air permitting and air pollution regulatory programs 
riverbend s june letter voluntarily disclosed the potential violations to epa and informed the agency of the steps that riverbend had taken and planned to take to achieve compliance 
in november  riverbend met with epa region personnel and discussed the disclosed violations  its plans to bring the riverbend compressor station into compliance  and possible resolution of the disclosed violations 
these discussions culminated in the negotiation of a consent decree that was signed by the parties and lodged in the united states district court of the district of utah on december  the consent resolves the apparent violations  requires gasco to pay a civil penalty of  specifies the appropriate corrective action  provides a schedule for riverbend to achieve such corrective action  and includes a covenant not to sue that will authorize riverbend to continue its operations  including certain capacity expansions  while the specified corrective action is being implemented 
the consent decree is awaiting entry by the court 
under the purchase agreement dated january  by which we sold our gathering system and its evaporative facilities located in uintah county  utah to monarch  we retained the obligation to pay any civil penalty assessed and the capital cost of the equipment required to be installed pursuant to the consent decree  and we also agreed to reimburse monarch for certain miscellaneous expenses incurred to finalize the consent decree and obtain certain changes to the riverbend compressor station s air permits that are 
table of contents required by the consent decree 
monarch is also a party to the consent decree and will be responsible for implementing most of the consent decree requirements at the riverbend compressor station other than the payment of a civil penalty and the installation of capital equipment 
we believe that all necessary pollution control and other equipment required by the consent decree is already installed at the site or accounted for in our capital budget  and that the civil penalty and the other expenses required by the consent decree will not materially affect our financial position or liquidity

table of contents nyse amex notifications our common stock is currently listed on the nyse amex  llc the nyse amex 
on june   we received a notice from the nyse amex llc nyse amex  dated june   informing us that we did not meet certain of the continued listing standards of the nyse amex 
specifically  the notice stated that we were not in compliance with section a i of the nyse amex company guide  with stockholders equity of less than  and net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years  and section a ii of the nyse amex company guide  with stockholders equity of less than  and net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years 
the notice also stated that in order to maintain its listing  we must submit a plan of compliance to the nyse amex by july  that addresses how we intend to regain compliance with sec tions a i and a ii of the nyse amex company guide by december  we submitted our plan to the nyse amex on july   and provided supplemental information on august   advising the nyse amex of the actions we have taken  and plan to take  to attempt to bring the company into compliance with the applicable listing standards by december  by letter dated september   the nyse amex notified us that it had accepted our plan and determined that  in accordance with section of the nyse amex company guide  we had made a reasonable demonstration of our ability to regain compliance with section a i and a ii of the nyse amex company guide by december  the nyse amex granted us an extension until december  the extension period to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the nyse amex company guide 
on november  the nyse amex notified us that  on the basis of a review of publically available information  we had resolved our continuing listing deficiencies 
the notice also stated that  as is the case for all listed issuers  our continued listing eligibility will be assessed on an ongoing basis 
amendments to credit facility on february   our million revolving credit facility the credit facility was amended to  among other things  incrementally reduce our borrowing base by a fixed amount in connection with certain contemplated asset sales  including the sale of the gathering assets described above  and  effective as of april   to automatically reduce to million  regardless of whether any of the contemplated asset sales were consummated 
effective february   in connection with the consummation of the asset sale and the application of the proceeds therefrom to pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we elected to reduce the borrowing base to million effective immediately 
on june   in connection with the exchange transaction  our credit facility was amended to  among other things  permit i our incurrence of indebtedness under the notes  ii our subsidiaries guarantee of the notes  iii our incurrence of indebtedness and related liens relating to certain insurance policies  iv the interest payments and equity payments of common stock and preferred stock required under the notes  and v and the exchange of the notes for the notes and other transactions and requirements contemplated by the exchange transaction further described in note convertible senior notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on november   in connection with the november borrowing base redetermination of our credit facility  our credit facility was amended  among other things  to acknowledge and reaffirm that our borrowing base is  which will remain in effect until the earlier of i the next redetermination of the borrowing base  which is currently scheduled for may and ii the date such 
table of contents borrowing base is otherwise reduced pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement and to extend the termination of the credit facility by one year to march  completion operations we began our up hole recompletion program in early february since then  we have successfully completed the initial stages on one upper mancos well and recompleted gross wells net with six gross wells net occurring in the fourth quarter in late march  we turned on one of the wells gasco operated working interest that we acquired as part of the petro canada acquisition discussed above  after installing production equipment and connecting it to sales 
the other well acquired in this acquisition was producing when it was purchased  however  our field personnel have optimized the production and have increased the flows rates on this well 
oilfield services and pressure pumping remain widely available to us and at competitive prices 
current per stage fracture stimulation costs are now averaging  as compared to  two years ago  a decrease 
the average recompletion includes six stages 
current recompletions are consistently yielding higher production rates for the upper blackhawk and mesaverde pay horizons 
the first eight upper blackhawk mesaverde recompletions in are realizing a greater than increase in their production over eight similar recompletions in when compared to each well s first eight week production period 
consequently  the decreased stimulation costs when combined with the increased production are contributing to much better per well economics 
as of december   we operated gross wells  and we currently have an inventory of operated wells with up hole recompletions and one upper mancos well awaiting initial completion activities 
we do not have a drilling rig under contract at this time  as was the case for all of california projects the operator of the project in the northwest mckittrick prospect continues to work with the california state agencies to acquire the appropriate permits 
the northwest mckittrick prospect lies below the mckittrick slide block and covers approximately gross acres targeting oil within the tulare  olig  mckittrick and stevens sands 
these sands are draped over a faulted anticlinal nose as interpreted from well data and surface geology 
our partner must carry us for a working interest in three wells that will test through the stevens sands to fully earn its working interest 
if no wells are drilled  we retain of the prospect 
the operator anticipates commencing drilling operations in the first half of our southwest cymric prospect is an oil prospect with two traps  a shallow approximately  hanging wall anticline above the mckittrick fault and a footwall block approximately  below the fault 
the traps are defined by reprocessed d seismic reflection lines integrated with well data and subsurface and surface geologic mapping that define the trap closures 
the oil targets are the tulare sand  the etchegoin formation sand and the antelope shale member of the monterey formation 
gasco is currently seeking a partner for this prospect 
the operator of the oil prospect in our willow springs prospect recently finished shooting and acquiring the d seismic data for this area 
the operator is processing the d seismic data to better identify the drill locations in the willow springs area 
our willow springs prospect has three anticlinally folded fault block traps located below the west dipping mckittrick thrust fault 
the prospect is targeting oil within the phacoides sandstone and the first  second and third sandstone members of the point of rocks 
table of contents formation 
our partner must carry us for a working interest in up to two wells drilled through the third point of rocks sandstone approximately  to fully earn its working interest 
if no wells are drilled  we retain of the prospect 
the first well is anticipated to be spud before year end our partner in our willow springs prospect also recently bought into our antelope valley trend group of nine oil and gas prospects that include both shallow horizons and deeper subthrust objectives 
the objectives within the antelope valley trend consist of four to five sand members within the temblor interval  including the carneros 
our partner is currently in the process of shooting d seismic over this series of prospects 
drilling on this trend is anticipated to occur in and the first well must be drilled through the mabury sand reservoir or to a depth of  whichever is less 
when the first well is drilled  our partner will earn approximately one half of the prospect area and four to five prospects as well  depending on the results of the d seismic 
our partner will then have the option to drill a second well on or before december  nb sp  the drilling of the second well will allow our partner to earn the remaining acreage and prospects 
our partner must carry us for a working interest in each well through the tanks to fully earns its working interest 
additionally we will receive a full license to the d seismic data for this area 
if no wells are drilled  we retain of the prospect and a license to the d seismic data 
we continue to pursue opportunities in the western area of the san joaquin basin 
we have identified additional leads and prospects within the overall trend of prospects defined by the antelope valley  willow springs  northwest mckittrick and southwest cymric prospects 
we have purchased existing seismic data are having this data reprocessed to better define these new leads and prospects 
we are also purchasing additional acreage as these prospects become defined 
wyoming during the second quarter  we sold our remaining acreage in wyoming along with our interest in two producing wells at an auction for  the low natural gas prices we were receiving in this area had made it difficult for us to find partners to participate in the drilling of wells in this area  and as a result  we reclassified all unproved leasehold costs associated with this area into proved property during summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes our capital expenditures during by reconciling the cash paid for acquisitions  development and exploration included within the consolidated statement of cash flows in item cash paid for acquisitions  development and exploration cash spent for property costs that were accrued at capital expenditures for projects lease acquisitions and related costs facilities and equipment costs drilling  completion and recompletion activity capital expenditures for projects 
table of contents production and reserve information in december  the sec adopted new rules related to modernizing reserve calculation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies  which became effective prospectively for annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the new rules expanded the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons from oil sands  shale  coal beds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas  and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction 
the use of new technologies is now permitted in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
other definitions and terms were revised  including the definition of proved reserves  which was revised to indicate that entities must u se the average of beginning of the month commodity prices over the preceding month period  rather than the end of period price  when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce 
likewise  the month average price is now used to calculate cost center ceilings for impairment and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
another significant provision of the new rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
in january  the fasb aligned the current oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with those of the sec 
as of december   we changed our method of determining the quantities of oil and gas reserves which impacted the amount recorded for depreciation  depletion and amortization and the ceiling test calculation for oil and gas properties 
under the new rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  and using the average  first day of the month price during the month periods ending december  and  respectively 
in prior years  we used the year end price  therefore  reserve estimates for the years ended december  and may not be directly comparable to those presented for prior periods 
the following table presents certain of our production information for each of the three years ended de cember  and our estimated proved reserves as of december of each year presented

table of contents the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily due to better than anticipated well performance related to behind pipe reserves that began producing during the revisions of previous estimates during were due primarily to a decrease in the gas price from per mcf at december  to per mcf at december  which caused some of our wells to become uneconomic 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the oil prices from per barrel at december  to per barrel at december  the majority of the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped reserves as the prices of per barrel and per mcf that were used to estimate our reserves caused all of our proved undeveloped reserves to become uneconomic

the capital markets  as they relate to us  have been adversely impacted by the recent financial crisis  the potential lack of liquidity in the banking system and the potential unavailability and cost of credit 
though recently there has been some improvement in the capital markets  there is no guarantee that such will continue 
in connection with certain asset sales see note asset sales and acquisitions of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the borrowing base under our credit facility was reduced to million effective february  additionally  our credit facility provides for periodic and special borrowing base redeterminations which could further affect our available borrowing base 
effective november   our borrowing base of million under our credit facility was reaffirmed and as of march   we have million of outstanding borrowings thereunder 
our borrowing base could be further reduced in the future by our lenders 
an inability to access additional borrowings in excess of our million of existing capacity under our credit facility will limit our ability to increase our operating budget and execute on our growth plans 
we continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources and ability to raise funds in the financial markets 
we adjust capital expenditures in response to changes in natural gas and oil prices  drilling results and cash flow 
if we need additional liquidity for future activities  including paying amounts owed in connection with a borrowing base reduction  if any  we may be required to consider several options for raising additional funds  such as sell ing securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar arrangements  but we may be unable to complete any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any financing obtained through the sale of our equity will likely result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
as of december  we had negative working capital of  which includes  related to the notes that will be settled in october with the completion of the exchange transaction in the second quarter of  which allowed us to extend the maturity date of most of our notes by four years  and the sale of our gathering assets  which allowed us to repay million in borrowings under our credit facility  we believe we are in a better position to execute our business plan

table of contents for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash flow cash provided by operations decreased by  from december  to december  the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the decrease in cash provided by operations was partially offset by increased oil and gas revenue primarily due to a increase in gas prices and a increase in oil prices  partially offset by the decrease in equivalent oil and gas production during the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during as compared with is primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas revenue resulting from a decrease in oil and gas prices of per mcf and per bbl combined with a decrease in production 
our investing activities during three years ended december  related primarily to our development and exploration activities  fixed asset additions and the change in our advances from joint interest owners 
the activity during included the sales proceeds of  associated primarily with the sale of our gathering and evaporative facilities and the sale of a partial working interest in producing wells see note asset sales and acquisitions of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

forward sales contracts during march  pursuant to that certain base contract for sale and purchase of natural gas that we have with anadarko energy services company  dated december   we entered into a term sales and transportation transaction to sell up to  mmbtu per day of our gross production through from the uinta basin 
the transaction contains two pricing mechanisms up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the nw rockies first of month price and up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the first of the month index price as published by gas daily for the north west wyoming poll index price 
we account for our agreement to physically settle our production as an executory contract 
capital budget our board of directors approved an initial capital expenditure budget of million for our oil and gas activities 
in the uinta basin  we allocated approximately million for our continued up hole recompletion program targeting natural gas and an additional million for the drilling and completion of two green river formation oil wells

the exchange transaction during the second quarter of  we completed the exchange of  aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes for  aggregate principal amount of our unsecured convertible senior notes due the notes  which are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock and or shares of a newly designated series c convertible preferred stock  par value per share the preferred stock  which are convertible into shares of common stock the exchange transaction 
we also paid to the holders of the notes that participated in the exchange transaction an aggregate cash amount of  equal to all accrued but unpaid interest with respect to the notes as of but not including the date of closing 
the notes were issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  provided by section and regulation d thereunder 
the notes have a final maturity date of october  and are governed by an indenture the indenture  dated as of june   by and between us and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee the trustee 
the indenture contains usual and customary covenants limiting the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  with certain exceptions  or liens on its property or assets  restricting its ability to make dividends or other distributions  requiring its domestic subsidiaries to guaranty the notes  and requiring it to list the shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the notes and the preferred stock on the nyse amex or any other us national or regional securities exchange on which the c ommon stock is then listed 
the initial conversion price for converting the notes into common stock is equal to per share of common stock  which is equal to a conversion rate of  shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances and limitations 
the initial conversion price for converting the notes into preferred stock  other than pursuant to an automatic conversion described below  is equal to  which is equal to a conversion rate of ten shares of preferred stock per  principal amount of notes 
pursuant to the indenture  we could not issue shares of common stock to holders of the notes including shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the notes or upon conversion of any shares of preferred stock issuable upon conversion of the notes or in payment of any change of control purchase pr ice  make whole premium or conversion make whole payment each as described in the indenture in excess of of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the exchange transaction the exchange cap  until stockholder approval of the issuance of common stock in excess of the exchange cap was obtained 
on september   at our annual meeting of stockholders  we received stockholder approval for the issuance of all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our notes and upon conversion of any shares of preferred stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in accordance with applicable law and the rules of the nyse amex 
accordingly  pursuant to the terms of the indenture  on september   we effected the automatic conversion of thirty percent of the notes  which equaled  aggregate principal amount  into  shares of preferred stock 
we also paid an aggregate cash amount of  equal to all accrued but unpaid interest on the notes subject to automatic conversion through september  see note convertible senior notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents credit facility our credit facility limits our borrowings to the borrowing base less our total outstanding letters of credit issued there under 
as of march  we have loans of approximately million and letters of credit of approximately  outstanding under our credit facility see note credit facility to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
under the terms of our credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination by our lenders thereunder the lenders based on their valuation of our proved reserves and their internal criteria 
in addition to such semi annual determinations  our lenders may request one additional borrowing base redetermination between each semi annual calculation 
if our borrowing base is further reduced as a result of a redetermination to a level below our then current outstanding borrowings  we will be required to repay the amount by which such outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base within days of notification by the lenders and we will have less or no access to borrowed capital going forward 
if we do not have sufficient funds on hand for repayment  we will be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders  refinance our credit facility or sell asset s or additional shares of common stock 
we may not be able to refinance or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in the event that we are unable to repay the amount owed within days  we will be in default under the credit facility  and as such the lenders party thereto will have the right to terminate their aggregate commitment under the credit facility and declare our outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable in whole 
an acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility in this manner would additionally constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our notes and our notes 
should an event of default occur and continue under the indentures governing the notes and the notes  the notes and the notes may be declared immediately due and payable at their principal amount together with accrued interest and liquidated damages  if any 
our credit facility contains covenants including those that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit facility  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such term is defined in the credit facility for the most recent four quarters not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit facility could result in a default which would  absent a waiver or amendment  require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
additionally  should our obligation to repay indebtedness under our credit facility be accelerated  we would be in default under the indentures governing our notes and notes  which would require repayment of the outstanding principal  interest and liquidated damages  if any  on such notes and notes 
as of december   our current and senior debt to ebitdax ratios are and  respectively  and we were in compliance with each of the covenants 
derivatives our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of three swap agreements for through december production 
the fair value of the agreements was a current asset of  as of december  and current liability of  and a noncurrent liability of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our economically hedged 
table of contents production 
see further discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during january  we entered into a costless collar agreement which contains a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  we will receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
this collar agreement is for  mmbtu day with a call price of mmbtu and a put price of mmbtu for production from january  through december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and gas properties and reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  the ceiling test provides that capitalized costs less related accumulated depletion and deferred income taxes for each cost center may not exceed the sum of the present value of future net revenue from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using current prices  excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  at a discount factor of  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less income tax effects related to differences in the book and tax basis of oil and gas properties 
should the net capitalized costs for a cost center exceed the sum of the components noted above  a ceiling test write down would be recognized to the extent of the excess capitalized costs exceed this ceiling 
under new oil and gas accounting rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  and using the average  first day of the month price during the month periods then ending 
in prior periods  we used the year end price and subsequent commodity price increases could be utilized to calculate the ceiling value 
as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
there was no additional impairment recorded for the remainder of or during therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the year ended december  estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on us because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the overall value of our company 
estimated quantities are affected by changes in commodity prices and actual well performance 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved properties 
if our reserve quantities change or if additional costs are reclassified from unproved properties into proved properties  depletion expense could be significantly affected 

table of contents estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of our wells have been producing less than seven years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the estimates of our proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as our wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
for example  a decrease in prices used to estimate our reserve quantities as of december  would result in a decrease in our december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
our management reviews all unproved property each quarter 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that we do not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  we record an impairment of the acreage and reclassify the costs to the full cost pool 
we estimate the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that we have recorded were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by us 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that we do not plan to deve lop in order to calculate the impairment 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total impairment recorded by us  calculation of depletion expense and the ceiling test analysis 
stock based compensation we account for stock option grants and restricted stock awards by recognizing compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the 
table of contents grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of option awards 
this model requires us to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of our common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
derivatives we have entered into certain commodity derivative instruments to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we recorded a change in the fair value of commodity derivative instruments of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  during we recorded a change in fair value of an embedded derivative associated with the exchange transaction of  see note convertible senior notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the fair value of the natural gas agreements was a current asset of  the fair value measurement of the commodity derivative assets and liabilities are measured based upon our valuation model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c notional quantities  d current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments and e the counterparty s credit risk 
the unobservable inputs related to the volatility of the oil and gas commodity market are very significant in these calculations 
continued volatility in these markets could have a significant impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
see note fair value measurements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion

table of contents gathering revenue and expenses gathering income increased by  during as compared with due to less revenue being eliminated as a result of our decreased average working interest in the wells during the decrease in gathering expense of  during is primarily due to decreased operating expenses due to the implementation of cost cutting measures as well as decreased production in rental income rental income during was comprised of the lease payments received from a third party s use of our drilling rig 
rental income was eliminated against the full cost pool when the rig was used to drill our operated wells and rental income was recognized when the rig was used to drill third party wells 
the rig was used for drilling third party wells during the first four months of as the rig was released from its last drilling project during april and was sold during june lease operating expenses the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas lease operating expenses during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  direct operating expenses and overhead workover expense total operating expenses operating expenses per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe total lease operating expense per mcfe lease operating expense decreased  during compared with the decrease is comprised of a  decrease in operating expenses combined with a  decrease in production and property taxes primarily due to the decrease in natural gas and oil prices during and to the use of severance tax exemptions related to certain of our gas wells 
the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due the implementation of cost savings measures such as the elimination of over time worked by our employees and the elimination of contractor services 
depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  during compared to is primarily due to the decrease in the full cost pool resulting from a property impairment of  that was recorded during the first quarter of impairment as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
therefore  an impairment expense of  was recorded for the year ended december  
table of contents impairment expense during represented a reduction in the fair value of our drilling rig 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believed that the market value of our drilling rig decreased from its carrying value of  to approximately  as of december  therefore  we recorded an impairment expense of  to reduce the carrying value of the rig during contract termination fee during february  we released our remaining drilling rig and paid the rig contractor  for early termination of the drilling contract  as calculated at  per day from the rig release date through march   the expiration date of the contract 
loss on sale of assets  net loss on sale of assets  net includes a loss of  on the sale of our drilling rig during june for proceeds of  which consisted of a cash payment of  and an interest bearing promissory note of  that has a maturity date of june  this loss was partially offset by a net gain of  representing the increase in the value of our inventory from when it was originally purchased to when it was transferred to the wells 
general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  total general and administrative costs general and administrative costs attributable to drilling  completion and operating activities general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses per mcfe total stock based compensation costs stock based compensation costs capitalized stock based compensation stock based compensation per mcfe total general and administrative expense including stock based compensation total general and administrative expense per mcfe general and administrative expense decreased by  in as compared with the decrease was primarily caused by a  decrease in stock based compensation expense due to certain stock options and restricted stock becoming fully vested and to the cancellation or forfeiture of options and restricted stock during this decrease was offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to cost cutting measures that we implemented during the first quarter of partially offset by increased legal fees due to the settlement of a lawsuit

interest expense interest expense during and consisted primarily of interest expense related to our outstanding convertible senior notes which were issued on october  and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the increase in interest expense of  was primarily due to increased borrowings and increased interest rates under our existing line of credit during derivative gains losses derivative gains were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these gains were comprised of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our derivative instruments 
the unrealized derivative gains losses represent the mark to market changes in our derivative assets and liabilities and the realized derivative gains losses represent the net settlements due from or to our counterparties based on each month s settlement during the year 
the change in these gains and losses during as compared with were due to the changes in the gas prices during the same periods 
interest income interest income increased  in compared with primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during recent accounting pronouncements in january  asc guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to require additional disclosures related to transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements and enhanced detail in the level reconciliation 
the guidance was amended to clarify the level of disaggregation required for assets and liabilities and the disclosures required for inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities that fall in either level or level the updated guidance was effective for our fiscal year beginning january   with the exception of the level disaggregation which is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
refer to note fair value measurements of the accompanying consolidated financial statemen ts for further details regarding the company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements  gathering  compression  processing and water disposal agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our derivative instruments consist of three swap agreements for our production 
the fair value of these agreements is a current asset of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
for our swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
the company s swap agreements as of december  are summarized in the table below agreement type remaining term quantity fixed price counterparty payer floating price a gasco payer swap  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies swap b  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies swap  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies a northwest pipeline rocky mountains inside ferc first of month index price 
b includes information pertaining to a portion of a single natural gas derivative contract with declining volumes 
the fixed price represents the weighted average price for the entire period from june through march during january  we entered into a costless collar agreement which contains a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  we will receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
this collar agreement is for  mmbtu day with a call price of mmbtu and a put price of mmbtu for production from january  through december  the swap contracts allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices that we will receive for our hedged production and to benefit from operating cash flows when market prices are less than the fixed prices of the contracts 
however  we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for the hedged production 
our hedging contracts have no requirements for us to post additional collateral based upon the changes in the market value of our hedge instruments 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
based on our average daily production for the year ended december   our annual revenue would increase or decrease by approximately  for each per barrel change in crude oil prices and  for each per mcf change in natural gas prices 

table of contents interest rate risk we do not currently use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure  including under our credit facility  to the volatility in interest rates 
a increase in interest rates on the average borrowings outstanding during the year ended would increase interest expense by approximately  per year
