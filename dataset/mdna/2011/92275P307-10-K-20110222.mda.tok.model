item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the other information appearing in this report 
as used in this report  unless the context otherwise indicates  references to we  our  ours  and us refer to venoco  inc and its subsidiaries collectively 
overview we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
our strategy is to grow through exploration  exploitation and development projects we believe to have the potential to add significant reserves on a cost effective basis and through selective acquisitions of underdeveloped properties 
in recent years  the exploration  exploitation and development of the onshore monterey shale formation has taken a fundamental role in our corporate strategy  and efforts to expand our knowledge of the onshore formation have increased significantly 
a substantial portion of our production is from offshore wells targeting the fractured monterey shale formation  and we believe that there are significant opportunities relating to the monterey shale formation onshore as well 
we are in the early stages of our onshore monterey shale project and  as expected  have not yet recorded any material proved reserves as of december  as a result of asset sales  our increased focus on an unproved asset and the development of oil projects over natural gas projects  our proved reserves and production have decreased in recent years 
we believe the opportunity is significant for future reserve and production growth from the oil projects we have pursued in and contemplate in our capital expenditure budget 
our average net production was  boe d in  compared to  boe d in and  boe d in excluding production from producing properties in texas  which we sold in a series of transactions in the first quarter of and the second quarter of see acquisitions and divestitures  our average net production was  boe d in  compared to  boe d in and  boe d in our proved reserves were mmboe at december   compared to mmboe at december  and mmboe at december  excluding reserves attributable to our producing texas properties  our reserves were mmboe at december  compared to mmboe at december  and mmboe at december  in the execution of our strategy  our management is principally focused on economically developing additional reserves of oil and natural gas and on maximizing production levels through exploration  exploitation and development activities on a cost effective basis and in a manner consistent with preserving adequate liquidity and financial flexibility 
capital expenditures we have developed an active capital expenditure program to take advantage of our extensive inventory of drilling prospects and other projects 
our development  exploitation and exploration capital expenditures were million in  up from million in approximately million of the capital expenditures went to drilling and rework activities  million for facilities  and the remaining million went to land  seismic and capitalized g a costs 
we incurred approximately million or of our capital expenditures in southern california  million or in the sacramento basin  and the remaining in areas outside of our core operating areas 
of the approximately million spent in southern california  approximately million went to projects targeting the onshore monterey shale formation 
our development  exploitation and exploration capital expenditure budget is million  of which approximately million or is expected to be deployed in southern california and 
table of contents million or to the sacramento basin 
of the million allocated to southern california  approximately million is expected to be deployed to onshore monterey shale activities with the remainder going to activities at legacy southern california fields 
the aggregate levels of capital expenditures for  and the allocation of those expenditures  are dependent on a variety of factors  including the availability of capital resources to fund the expenditures and changes in our business assessments as to where our capital can be most profitably employed 
accordingly  the actual levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of those expenditures may vary materially from our estimates 
the following summarizes certain significant aspects of our capital spending program and the outlook for southern california legacy fields in the west montalvo field  we have pursued an aggressive workover  recompletion and return to production program since acquiring the field in may that has resulted in significant production gains 
the field has not been fully delineated offshore or fully developed onshore and we continue to evaluate our drilling results and refine our development program for the coming years 
during  our principal activities in the field were the completion of two wells that were spud toward the end of  workover activities on three wells  and various facility upgrades to optimize future development 
we plan to drill at least two wells in the field during in the sockeye field  we completed a hydraulic fracture of the e well and drilled a dual completion well that produces from the monterey shale formation and injects into the lower topanga formation  increasing the sweep of the waterflood in that zone 
a planned redrill of an inactive well that targets the monterey shale formation was delayed as a result of a drilling moratorium imposed by the secretary of the us department of the interior 
wells drilled from platform gail are no longer subject to a moratorium and we plan to proceed with the redrill in our capital expenditure budget contemplates minimal activity levels at sockeye other than the redrill 
at the south ellwood field  we performed six recompletions during we continue to work on advancing the permitting process for three of the five proved undeveloped locations on our existing leases and continue to perform the facilities work in order to begin drilling those locations in our capital expenditure budget includes plans to drill one of our proved undeveloped locations and perform six recompletions at south ellwood 
in addition  our subsidiary ellwood pipeline  inc is pursuing the permits necessary to build a common carrier pipeline that would allow us to transport our oil from the south ellwood field to refiners without the use of a barge or the marine terminal we currently use 
we anticipate that approval hearings for the project will be held during mid while we believe the pipeline should be approved  the outcome of these hearings cannot be predicted 
pending completion of the pipeline  we expect to use a double hulled barge to transport oil production from the field 
southern california onshore monterey shale in  we began actively leasing onshore acreage in southern california targeting the monterey shale  a miocene age strata 
our leasing has focused on areas where we believe the monterey shale will produce light  sweet oil  and where the quality and depth of the monterey shale is expected to be advantageous 
as of december   our onshore monterey shale acreage position totaled approximately  gross and  net acres 
an additional  gross and  net acres with monterey shale production or potential are held by production 
as of february   our onshore monterey shale acreage position is approximately  net acres  net acres including acreage held by production 
we spud seven vertical wells designed as science wells in the onshore monterey shale in  which involved logging and coring to be used to correlate our petrophysical model  and one additional 
table of contents vertical well that was used as a pilot hole for our first horizontal well 
we have used various completion techniques on these wells  including acidizing and fracture stimulations 
production test rates on the vertical wells have ranged from boe d to more than boe d  and all but one of the wells have tested light oil to degree api 
we also spud four horizontal wells in targeting the onshore monterey shale 
the first of these  drilled in the san joaquin basin  was uneconomic 
the second and third wells were drilled in the santa maria basin and final completion and testing is expected late in the first quarter of we have completed drilling the fourth horizontal well and expect final completion and testing in the second quarter of as described in trends affecting our results of operations expected production  we currently expect only modest production from our onshore monterey shale wells in we have designed the initial vertical wells to provide scientific information that we will use to evaluate the specific prospect area  as well as individual zones in the wellbore that are prospective for drilling horizontal wells 
information developed from cutting cores in these vertical wells and analysis of those cores will be used to correlate our petrophysical model with data from historical well logs in the area 
we expect our horizontal wells to have greater potential for production 
our primary focus with respect to our initial horizontal wells  however  is on using our experience with  and the data generated from  those wells to develop and refine drilling and completion techniques that will be successful in the formation and effective processes for the identification of productive intervals on a replicable basis 
we currently have two drilling rigs operating in the onshore monterey shale  both of which are capable of drilling horizontal wells  and we have secured a third rig  which is scheduled to arrive by march 
we are also working to secure a fourth rig in order to execute our capital expenditure program 
our capital expenditure budget includes plans to drill approximately gross wells 
we also plan to complete the second and final phase of what we believe to be california largest d seismic shoot during the first half of and to continue leasing throughout the year 
sacramento basin in the sacramento basin  we continue to pursue our infill drilling program in the greater grimes and willows fields 
during  we spud wells were productive  completed including wells spud in  and performed recompletions in the basin 
we continue to test and evaluate potential downspacing opportunities in the basin as well as new methods of improving productivity and reducing drilling costs 
we also continue to pursue our hydraulic fracturing program in the basin and fractured wells in as of december   we had identified drilling locations in the basin  and we anticipate identifying additional locations as we pursue further exploration  exploitation and development opportunities 
we believe the sacramento basin presents significant exploration opportunities and in order to further our understanding of these opportunities we drill a small number of what we consider to be exploratory wells in the basin each year 
operationally  we distinguish these exploratory wells from the numerous non proved locations that we drill each year as part of our development drilling program but are considered exploratory wells as defined in sec regulation s x 
we plan to reduce activity levels in the basin in as a result of depressed natural gas prices and our increased focus on our oil based monterey shale activities 
our capital expenditure budget for the basin includes plans for approximately wells  recompletions  and fracs 
we anticipate the activity levels contemplated in our budget will result in average daily production in that is roughly consistent with average daily production 
production from the basin in the beginning of is expected to be relatively flat with the fourth quarter of  then decline throughout the year as a result of the lower activity in we would expect to return to a focus on growth in the basin when natural gas prices improve 
as of december   our acreage position in the basin was approximately  net acres  gross 

table of contents texas in anticipation of the sale of our texas producing assets see acquisitions and divestitures  we did not invest any significant capital in texas in acquisitions and divestitures sale of cat canyon field 
in december  we sold our interests in the cat canyon field for million before closing adjustments 
the field comprised less than of our proved reserves at december   or mboe  and contributed approximately boe d to our production during we used the proceeds to repay million of principal on the second lien term loan 
sale of other texas assets 
following the sale of the hastings complex  we sold our remaining producing assets in texas in a series of transactions that were completed in the second quarter of to multiple purchasers for aggregate net proceeds of million after closing adjustments and related expenses 
we used the proceeds to repay million of principal on the revolving credit facility and million of principal on the second lien term loan 
we retained the right to back into a working interest of approximately in the co project denbury is pursuing at the field after it recoups certain costs 
in december  denbury commenced injecting co at the hastings complex 
the texas properties sold comprised of our proved reserves at december  or mmboe and contributed approximately boe d to our production during sacramento basin asset acquisition 
in june  we acquired certain natural gas producing properties in the sacramento basin for approximately million 
hastings complex sale 
in february  we completed the sale of our principal interests in the hastings complex to denbury for approximately million 
other 
we have an active acreage acquisition program and we regularly engage in acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  dispositions of oil and natural gas properties  primarily in and around our existing core areas of operations  including transactions in each of  and trends affecting our results of operations oil and natural gas prices 
historically  prices received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and that volatility is expected to continue 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact many aspects of our business  including our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity  rate of growth  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  all of which depend in part upon those prices 
we employ a hedging strategy in order to reduce the variability of the prices we receive for our production and provide a minimum revenue stream 
as of february  we had hedge contract floors covering approximately of our annual production guidance 
we have also begun to secure hedge contracts for our and production 
all of our derivatives counterparties are members  or affiliates of members  of our revolving credit facility syndicate 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity derivative transactions for further details concerning our hedging activities 
expected production 
during  we began to emphasize our oil projects in southern california relative to our natural gas projects in the sacramento basin 
we plan to continue this strategy in  with approximately of our planned capital expenditures allocated to our onshore monterey shale program in southern california and an additional allocated to our legacy southern california fields 
we expect that the execution of our capital expenditure plan will result in a modest increase in average daily production volumes in relative to we expect our onshore monterey shale project to contribute a relatively small percentage of our overall production in however  we 
table of contents expect production from that project to provide the modest production growth we anticipate for the year 
if successful  we believe that the project could result in significant production growth in subsequent years 
our expectations with respect to future production rates are subject to a number of uncertainties  including those associated with third party services  the availability of drilling rigs  oil and natural gas prices  events resulting in unexpected downtime  permitting issues  drilling success rates  including our ability to identify productive intervals and the drilling and completion techniques necessary to achieve commercial production in the onshore monterey shale  and other factors  including those referenced in risk factors 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses loe of per boe remained consistent compared to our full year results of per boe 
we expect our loe per boe to increase slightly relative to due to our expected focus on oil projects  which tend to have higher operating costs than natural gas projects 
our expectations with respect to future expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those described and referenced in the preceding paragraph 
production and property taxes 
production and property taxes per boe decreased to per boe for compared to per boe for we expect production property taxes to increase slightly on a per boe basis compared to our results 
as with lease operating expenses  our expectations with respect to future expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly from per boe for excluding share based compensation charges of per boe  to per boe excluding share based compensation charges of per boe and one time charges of per boe for severance payments resulting from the sale of our texas producing properties in excluding share based compensation charges  on a per boe basis  we expect our g a costs to be relatively flat in compared to as with our lease operating expenses and production and property taxes  our expectations with respect to g a costs are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a for of per boe increased slightly from our full year dd a of per boe 
we expect our dd a to increase modestly on a per boe basis compared to our full year results 
as with lease operating expenses  production and property taxes and g a expenses  our expectations with respect to dd a expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
unrealized derivative gains and losses 
unrealized gains and losses result from mark to market valuations of derivative positions that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges and are reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in our income statement 
payments actually due to or from counterparties in the future on these derivatives will typically be offset by corresponding changes in prices ultimately received from the sale of our production 
we have incurred significant unrealized gains and losses in recent periods and may continue to incur these types of gains and losses in the future 
in february  we settled our outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
results of operations the following table reflects the components of our oil and natural gas production and sales prices  and our operating revenues  costs and expenses  for the periods indicated

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to increases in realized oil and natural gas prices  partially offset by a decrease in production as described below 
oil sales increased by million in to million compared to million in oil production decreased by  with production of  mbbl in compared to  mbbl in the production decrease was due in large part to the sale of the hastings complex in early february and the sales of our remaining producing properties in texas in the second quarter of excluding production from the texas properties  production decreased by mbbls from  mbbls in to  mbbls in this decrease is primarily due to i the natural decline of production at the sockeye and south ellwood fields and ii reduced production at the dos cuadras field as a result of certain wells being taken offline due to temporary operational difficulties 

table of contents our average realized price for oil increased from per bbl in to per bbl in natural gas sales increased million in to million compared to million in natural gas production decreased  with production of  mmcf in compared to  mmcf in the decrease was due in large part to the sales of our producing properties in texas during the second quarter of excluding production from the texas properties  natural gas production decreased by mmcf from  mmcf in to  mmcf in the slight decrease in production is primarily due to the natural decline of production from wells in the sacramento basin  the majority of which has been offset by production from newly drilled and recompleted wells 
our average realized price for natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf for other revenues 
other revenues increased by million to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a contract that became effective in april  related to the double hulled barge that transports oil produced at our south ellwood field see transportation expenses 
the contract allows us to sub charter the barge and retain the revenues from those activities 
the increase in other revenues is the result of sub charter activities in lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses loe decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the hastings complex in early february and the sale of our remaining texas properties in the second quarter of excluding the texas properties  production expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower non recurring maintenance costs incurred at our south ellwood field in compared to on a per unit basis  loe was per boe in both and excluding the texas assets  loe per boe increased from per boe in to per boe in the increase on a per boe basis is the result of lower production levels in compared to production and property taxes 
production and property taxes decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was partially due to the sale of the hastings complex in early february and the sale of our remaining texas properties in the second quarter of excluding the texas properties  production and property taxes decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower supplemental property taxes incurred in as compared to resulting from lower gas prices and lower assessed mineral rights valuations for drilling and recompletion activities 
transportation expenses 
transportation expenses increased million to million in from million in on a per boe basis  transportation expenses increased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in the increase is primarily due to the contract described in other revenues  related to the time charter of a double hulled barge to transport oil produced from our south ellwood field 
under that contract we pay a flat day rate  regardless of our usage of the barge  but have the ability to sub charter the vessel when it is not in use transporting production from the south ellwood field see other revenues 
we also incurred additional transportation costs from the use of a single hulled barge during the transition period to the double hulled barge  which was completed late in the fourth quarter of depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a 
dd a expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is related to i a lower amortizable base in resulting from the application of the net proceeds from the sales of our texas producing properties and the cat canyon field and ii lower production in compared to dd a expense on a per unit basis increased by from per boe for to per boe for

income tax expense benefit 
we incurred losses before income taxes in and these losses were a key consideration that led us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  and december  since we could not conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
as long as we continue to conclude that we have a need for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  we likely will not have any income tax expense or benefit other than for federal alternative minimum tax expense  a release of a portion of the valuation allowance for net operating loss carryback claims  or for state income taxes 
the current tax benefit for of million reflects a reduction of prior year current tax expense a million benefit and  due to the temporary five year carryback period that became available in  a carryback of net operating losses a million benefit 
the income tax benefit we recorded for primarily relates to an increase in the estimated net operating loss carryback claims for the through tax years and a reduction in the amount owed for prior year state income taxes 
additionally  we amended prior year returns in for certain share based compensation matters  which will result in additional income tax refunds

first  we issued million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the underwriters have the option to purchase up to an aggregate of million additional shares of common stock to cover any over allotments 
we received net proceeds of approximately million in the equity transaction after deducting estimated offering related expenses 
second  we issued million of senior unsecured notes which are due in february we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering  after deducting estimated offering related expenses 
the proceeds from the two transactions were used to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest related to our second lien term loan  settle the related interest rate swap contracts and repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
estimated remaining cash on hand from the transactions after those uses and estimated offering related expenses was million 
we plan to make substantial capital expenditures in the future for the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
we expect that our exploration  exploitation and development capital expenditures  which were million in  will be approximately million in we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget primarily with cash flow from operations  supplemented with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the equity transaction described above 
additionally  we continue to pursue joint venture transactions related to our monterey shale development project 
we have significant flexibility to reduce capital expenditures if warranted by business conditions or limits on our capital resources 
uncertainties relating to our capital resources and requirements in include the possibility that one 
table of contents or more of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements may fail to perform under the contracts  the effects of changes in commodity prices and differentials  results from our onshore monterey shale program  which could lead us to accelerate or decelerate activities depending on the extent of our success in developing the program  and the possibility that we will pursue one or more significant acquisitions that would require additional debt or equity financing 
amended revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility  which now has a maturity date of january  the agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default  indemnities and covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  require us to maintain derivative contracts covering a portion of our anticipated production and require us to maintain specified ratios of current assets to current liabilities and debt to ebitda 
the minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities as those terms are defined in the agreement is one to one  the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement is four to one 
while we do not expect to be in violation of any of our debt covenants during  we believe that it will be important to monitor the debt to ebitda ratio requirement  especially if our ebitda is less than we expect due to operational problems or other factors  or if our borrowing needs are greater than we expect 
the agreement requires us to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
loans under the revolving credit facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of x bank of montreal announced base rate  y the overnight federal funds rate plus and z the one month libor plus  plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
loans designated as libo rate loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i libor plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
a commitment fee of per annum is payable with respect to unused borrowing availability under the facility 
the revolving credit facility has a total capacity of million  but is limited by a borrowing base which is currently established at million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination twice each year  and may be redetermined at other times at our request or at the request of the lenders 
lending commitments under the facility have been allocated at various percentages to a syndicate of ten banks 
certain of the institutions included in the syndicate have received support from governmental agencies in connection with events in the credit markets 
a failure of any members of the syndicate to fund under the facility  or a reduction in the borrowing base  would adversely affect our liquidity 
in february  we repaid the outstanding principal balance on our revolving credit facility using proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
as of february   there was no balance drawn on our revolving credit facility 
during  we paid million toward the principal balance of our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of with the proceeds from the sales of our texas producing properties  which we completed in the second quarter of second lien term loan and senior notes 
we entered into a million senior secured second lien term loan agreement in may prior to repayment as described below  the term loan facility was secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our assets and was due to mature on may  loans under the second lien term loan facility designated as base rate loans bore interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of the overnight federal funds rate plus and the administrative agent announced base rate  plus ii 
loans designated as libo rate loans bore interest at libor plus 
we repaid million of principal under the facility in after the sales of our texas producing properties and the cat canyon field and million of principal in after the hastings complex sale 

table of contents in february  we issued million in senior unsecured notes due in february at par 
concurrently with the sale of the senior notes  we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of million on the second lien term loan  plus accrued interest of million 
the senior notes pay interest semi annually in arrears on february and august of each year 
we may redeem the notes prior to february  at a make whole premium defined in the indenture 
beginning february   we may redeem the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount and declining to by february  the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and contain operational covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets 
senior notes 
in october  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in october at a price of of par 
the senior notes pay interest semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year 
we may redeem the senior notes prior to october  at a make whole price defined in the indenture 
beginning october   we may redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount and declining to by october  the indenture governing the notes contains operational covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets 
because we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of amounts due under our debt agreements  that portion of our cash flow is not available for other purposes 
our ability to make scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and pursue our capital expenditure plan will depend to a significant extent on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices and a variety of other factors 
if our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our capital expenditure budget  we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled capital projects  sell material assets or operations and or seek additional capital 
needed capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness and certain other means is limited by covenants in our debt agreements 
in addition  pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions in our revolving credit facility  our ability to respond to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets or incurring additional indebtedness would be limited by provisions in the facility that require us to use some or all of the proceeds of such transactions to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility in some circumstances 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed and on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us  meet our debt obligations or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 
commitments and contingencies as of december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years were as follows in thousands less than one year to years to years after years total long term debt interest on senior notes office  property and equipment leases seismic total total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement 
table of contents obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
our total asset retirement obligations were million at december  amounts related to interest expense on our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility are not included in the table above because the interest rates on those debt instruments are variable 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred interest expense on those debt instruments of million  million and million  respectively 
the principal balance of the second lien term loan of million  which was due in  was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes in february the senior notes are due in february we are contractually obligated to pay certain costs related to a d seismic shoot in the san joaquin basin that is targets the monterey shale formation 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  oil and natural gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on the likelihood of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them may vary 
table of contents substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value and the rate of depletion of the oil and natural gas properties 
for example  oil and natural gas price changes affect the estimated economic lives of oil and natural gas properties and therefore cause reserve revisions 
our december  estimate of net proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled mmboe 
had oil and natural gas prices been lower as of the date of the estimate  our total oil and natural gas reserves would have been approximately lower 
in addition  our proved reserves are concentrated in a relatively small number of wells 
at december   of our proved reserves were concentrated in our largest wells 
as a result  any changes in proved reserves attributable to such individual wells could have a significant effect on our total reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development and capitalized asset retirement costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment 
changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
for example  a reduction in our estimated reserves as of december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately per boe in our average depletion expense rate 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed  at least annually  for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven  either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist 
under full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  excluding costs associated with unproved properties  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated twelve month arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of each month of the relevant period and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
we did not have ceiling test write downs during or at december   our net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling by million  net of income tax effects  and we recorded a write down of our oil and natural gas properties in that amount 
per the guidance in effect at the time  the year end prices were used to determine reserves at december  we could be required to recognize additional impairments of oil and gas properties in future periods if market prices of oil and natural gas decline 

table of contents asset retirement obligations the accounting standards set forth by the fasb with respect to accounting for asset retirement obligations provide that  if the fair value for asset retirement obligations can be reasonably estimated  the liability should be recognized in the period when it is incurred 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well 
under this method  the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset inception  with the offsetting charge to property cost 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded in the income statement 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable laws 
we have determined our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to each liability 
the discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the relevant obligation  but typically ranged between and 
we periodically review the estimate of costs to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives 
this includes a review of both the estimated costs and the expected timing to incur such costs 
we believe most of these costs can be estimated with reasonable certainty based upon existing laws and regulatory requirements and based upon wells and facilities currently in place 
any changes in regulatory requirements  which changes cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  could result in material changes in such costs 
changes in reserve estimates and the economic life of oil and natural gas properties could affect the timing of such costs and accordingly the present value of such costs 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we have recognized a valuation allowance against our net deferred taxes because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of estimates of our future operating income based on current oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  available taxes in carryback periods  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods 
derivative instruments we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  risk free interest rates  credit adjusted discount rates and estimated volatility factors 
changes in commodity prices will result in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative agreements  and in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity collars to the extent the changes are outside the floor or cap of our collars 
we do not apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative contracts  therefore we recognize mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec published revised rules regarding oil and gas reserves reporting requirements 
the objective of the rules is to provide readers of financial statements with more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
key elements of the revised rules include a change in the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end  certain revised definitions  optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves  allowance of the use of new technologies in the determination of reserves and additional disclosure requirements 
the rules also revised the prices used for reserves in determining depletion and the full cost ceiling test from a period end price to a twelve month arithmetic average price 
the revised rules are effective for annual reporting periods for fiscal years ending on or after december  application of the revised rules resulted in changes to the prices used to determine proved reserves at december  and  as well as additional disclosures 
in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which amended existing oil and gas reserve accounting and disclosure guidance to align its requirements with the sec revised rules discussed above 
the significant revisions involve revised definitions of oil and gas producing activities  changing the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end to a twelve month arithmetic average and additional disclosure requirements 
in contrast to the sec rule  the fasb does not permit the disclosure of probable and possible reserves in the supplemental oil and gas information in the notes to the financial statements 
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after december  application of the revised rules is prospective and companies are not required to change prior period presentation to conform to the amendments 
application of the amended guidance resulted in changes to the prices used to determine proved reserves at december  and  which did not result in significant changes to our oil and natural gas reserves 
pv the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices except that for periods prior to december   the period end price was used  without giving effect to hedging activities or future escalation  costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an annual discount rate of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we purchase puts and enter into other derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil and natural gas prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
we may  from time to time  opportunistically restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to effectively modify the terms of current contracts in order to improve the pricing parameters in existing contracts or realize the current value of our existing positions 
we may use the proceeds from such transactions to secure additional contracts for periods in which we believe there is additional unmitigated commodity price risk 
this section also provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage interest rate risk

the objective of our hedging activities and the use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows 
our hedging activities seek to mitigate our exposure to price declines and allow us more flexibility to continue to execute our capital expenditure plan even if prices decline 
our collar and swap contracts  however  prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
we do not enter into hedge positions for amounts greater than our expected production levels  however  if actual production is less than the amount we have hedged and the price of oil or natural gas exceeds a fixed price in a hedge contract  we will be required to make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
this could impact our liquidity and our ability to fund future capital expenditures 
if we were unable to satisfy such a payment obligation  that default could result in a cross default under our revolving credit agreement 
in addition  we have incurred  and may incur in the future  substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in connection with our hedging activities  although we do not expect such losses to have a material effect on our liquidity or our ability to fund expected capital expenditures 
in addition  the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
we generally have netting arrangements with our counterparties that provide for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with that counterparty in the event of contract termination 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
all of the counterparties to our derivative contracts are also lenders  or affiliates of lenders  under our revolving credit facility 
collateral under the revolving credit facility supports our collateral obligations under our derivative contracts 
therefore  we are not required to post additional collateral when we are in a derivative liability position 
our revolving credit facility and our derivative contracts contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative transactions and consequently  we recognize mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently  rather than deferring such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income for those commodity derivatives that would qualify as cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at 
table of contents the determination date 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in commodity derivative gains losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the fair value of our commodity derivatives was a net asset of million 
interest rate derivative transactions during  we were subject to interest rate risk with respect to amounts borrowed under our credit facilities because those amounts bore interest at variable rates 
we entered into interest rate swap transactions to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of variable rate borrowings through may whereby we paid a fixed interest rate of and received a floating interest rate based on the one month libo rate 
as a result  million of our variable rate debt effectively bore interest at a fixed rate of approximately until may in february  we repaid the full principal balance outstanding on the second lien term loan from proceeds received from the issuance of our senior notes see capital resources and requirements  which reduced our debt subject to variable rate interest to any amounts which may be outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
as a result  we settled our interest rate swaps for million in february the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a liability of million at december  see notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt as of december
