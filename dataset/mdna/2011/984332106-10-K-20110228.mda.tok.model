table of contents search agreement with microsoft corporation on december   yahoo entered into the search and advertising services and sales agreement search agreement with microsoft  which provides for microsoft to be the exclusive algorithmic and paid search services provider on yahoo properties and non exclusive provider of such services on affiliate sites 
under the search agreement  yahoo will be the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies premium search advertisers  which include advertisers meeting certain spending or other criteria  advertising agencies that specialize in or offer search engine marketing services and their clients  and resellers and their clients seeking assistance with their paid search accounts 
the global transition to microsoft as the exclusive algorithmic and paid search services provider on yahoo properties and non exclusive provider of such services on affiliate sites are being done on a market by market basis and are expected to continue through early the transition occurred in the united states us and canada in the fourth quarter of  and we continue to transition algorithmic and paid search in other markets 
the search agreement terminates in february  subject to earlier termination as provided in the search agreement 
under the search agreement  microsoft has agreed to reimburse us for certain transition costs up to an aggregate total of million during the first three years of the search agreement

these search operating cost reimbursements and certain employee retention costs are separate from and in addition to the million of transition cost reimbursement payments 
our results for the year ended december  reflect million in search operating cost reimbursements from microsoft under the search agreement 
search operating cost reimbursements will continue until we complete the transition to microsoft s platform in all markets 
search operating cost reimbursements are expected to decline as we fully transition all markets and the underlying expenses will no longer be incurred under our cost structure following completion of the transition and the amounts saved will be available for reinvestment 
our results for the year ended december  also reflect transition cost reimbursements from microsoft under the search agreement  which were equal to the transition costs of million incurred by yahoo related to the search agreement in the year ended december  in addition  in the year ended december   we recorded million for reimbursement of transition costs incurred in  million for employee retention costs incurred in  and million for employee retention costs incurred in the transition cost reimbursements were recorded in after regulatory clearance in the us and europe was received  implementation of the search agreement commenced  and microsoft became obligated to make such payments 
we record receivables for the reimbursements as costs are incurred and apply them against the operating expense categories in which the costs were incurred 
as of december   we had incurred a total of million of reimbursable expenses related to the search agreement 
of that amount  million had been received from microsoft  and million was classified as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the million of reimbursements were received during the first quarter of during the first five years of the search agreement  in transitioned markets we are entitled to receive percent of the revenue generated from microsoft s services on yahoo properties and we are also entitled to receive percent of the revenue generated from microsoft s services on affiliate sites after the affiliate s share of revenue and certain microsoft costs are deducted 
in the transitioned markets  for search revenue generated from microsoft s services on yahoo properties and affiliate sites  we report as revenue the percent revenue share  as we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement with the advertisers 
as a result of the required change in revenue presentation and the revenue share with microsoft  our revenue and traffic acquisition costs for the first quarter of are expected to be lower than these amounts would otherwise have been by approximately million and million  respectively

table of contents to assist us in evaluating display advertising and search advertising  beginning in the fourth quarter of we began reporting the number of web pages viewed by users page views separately for display and search 
search page views is defined as the number of web pages viewed by users on yahoo properties and affiliate sites resulting from search queries and revenue per search page view is defined as search revenue divided by our search page views 
display page views is defined as the total number of page views on yahoo properties less the number of search page views on yahoo properties  and revenue per display page view is defined as display revenue divided by our display page views 
while we also receive display revenue for content match links advertising in the form of contextually relevant links to advertisers websites on yahoo properties and affiliate sites and for display advertising on affiliate sites  we do not include that revenue or those page views in our discussion or calculation of display page views or revenue per display page view because the net revenue and related volume metrics associated with them are not currently material to display revenue 
we periodically review and refine our methodology for monitoring  gathering  and counting page views on yahoo properties 
based on this process  from time to time  we update our methodology to exclude from the count of page views interactions with our servers that we determine or believe are not the result of user visits to yahoo properties 
display revenue 
display revenue for the year ended december  increased by percent  compared to increased advertising spending in display and a shift towards higher yielding display inventory have resulted in increased display revenue 
display revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent  compared to although increased user activity levels on yahoo properties contributed to a higher volume of display page views during  lower advertising spending due to the economic environment during the majority of resulted in decreased display revenue compared to during  the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also contributed to the decline in display revenue  compared to for the year ended december   display page views decreased percent and revenue per display page view increased percent  compared to due to the increase in revenue as discussed above

search revenue 
search revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent  compared to search advertising revenue decreased primarily due to the required change in revenue presentation in the fourth quarter of to reflect the revenue share with microsoft for transitioned markets and the impact of discontinuing our paid inclusion search product in the fourth quarter of as part of our advertising quality initiatives 
the decreases were offset  in part  by the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in the asia pacific segment and a new affiliate in the asia pacific segment added in the fourth quarter of search revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent  compared to although increased traffic contributed to a higher volume of search queries on both yahoo properties and affiliate sites during  lower advertising spending due to the economic environment during the majority of and a shift towards lower yielding inventory and non commercial search terms resulted in decreased search revenue

other revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent  compared to the decrease can be primarily attributed to changes in certain of our broadband access partnerships  our shift from a fee paying user structure to other fee structures  as well as the outsourcing of various offerings

we expense tac under two different methods 
agreements with fixed payments are expensed ratably over the term the fixed payment covers  and agreements based on a percentage of revenue  number of searches  or other metrics are expensed based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate

total compensation expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in stock based compensation expense due to recently granted stock based compensation awards having a lower grant date fair value than stock based compensation awards currently vesting

table of contents q restructuring plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented additional cost reduction initiatives  including a workforce reduction and consolidation of certain real estate facilities 
we began to consolidate and exit selected facilities beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued this process through the second quarter of we vacated and ceased use of the facilities identified under the plan 
non cancelable lease costs were determined based on the present value of remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease income 
present value computations use discount rates based on published treasury risk free interest rates  adjusted for our credit spread  which is consistent with observable credit spreads of companies with similar credit standing 
the cost of exiting and terminating our facility leases was determined by referring to the contractual terms of the agreements  by evaluating the current real estate market conditions  and  where applicable  by referring to amounts in negotiation 
our ability to generate the estimated amounts of sublease income  as well as to terminate lease obligations at the estimated amounts  is dependent upon the commercial real estate market conditions in certain geographies at the time we negotiate the lease termination and sublease arrangements with third parties 
these amounts represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur and could be subject to adjustment as market conditions change 
the fair value measurement of the liability related to exited facilities involves the use of certain significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall within level of the fair value hierarchy established by accounting guidance described in note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining lease obligations will be settled over the remaining lease terms which expire through fiscal and will be adjusted for changes in estimates or the impact of sublease contracts

goodwill impairment charge 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of october each year 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
as a result of this test in  we previously concluded that the carrying value of our european reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
at the time of this test in  the fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a significant margin and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired 
the goodwill impairment in our european reporting unit resulted from a combination of factors  including the global economic downturn  a persistent decline in business conditions  reductions in projected operating results  reductions in estimated future cash flows  and decreases in revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies in the region 
we had no goodwill impairment charges in the years ended december  and significant changes in the economic environment and our operating results may result in future impairment of our reporting units

income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes and earnings in equity interests as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  income tax at the us federal statutory rate of percent state income taxes  net of federal benefit change in valuation allowance stock based compensation expense research tax credits effect of non us operations resolution with tax authorities tax gain in excess of book gain from sales of zimbra  inc and hotjobs due to basis differences nondeductible goodwill tax restructuring other provision for income taxes percent of income before income taxes and earnings in equity interests 

table of contents certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation 
the differences above are further explained as follows state taxes are higher in than in prior years due to a reduction of deferred tax assets associated with an effective tax rate reduction in california starting in stock based compensation increases our effective tax rate to the extent that stock based compensation expense recorded in our financial statements is non deductible for tax purposes 
this primarily occurs with regard to options granted outside the us the effective tax rate increase is lower than in prior years due to recently granted stock based compensation awards having a lower grant date fair value than stock based compensation awards from prior years 
that effect results in a lower non deductible expense for financial statement purposes and a lower increase to our effective tax rate 
additionally  in there is a lower effective tax rate impact associated with non deductible stock based compensation awards related to prior year acquisitions to the extent such awards became vested or forfeited in our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
operating losses in some non us jurisdictions cannot be used to offset profits and thus increase the overall effective tax rate 
the impact of those losses in was lower than in prior years 
additionally  in  we benefited from increased profit in lower tax jurisdictions  primarily in asia 
in we had a favorable resolution of certain issues in an irs examination of our and us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction of reserves for tax uncertainties and the availability of capital loss carryforwards to offset the tax on the gain from the sales of zimbra  inc and hotjobs 
during  in connection with tax restructuring activities  we reached a formal agreement with the irs through a pre filing agreement to treat certain intercompany bad debts as deductible business expenses on the federal income tax return 
our gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  is million  of which million is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the agreements reached in with the irs resulted in a reduction to our gross unrecognized tax benefits of million 
of this million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits  million resulted in an effective tax rate benefit 
the reduction to the gross unrecognized tax benefits has been partially offset by increases from current year tax positions 
in total  the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december  decreased by million from the recorded balance as of december  during the year ended december   the irs completed its field examination of our and tax returns and issued notices of proposed adjustment 
we reached an agreement with the irs in connection with several of the adjustments and adjusted our reserves accordingly 
there are other proposed adjustments  including an intercompany transfer pricing matter which could have a significant impact on our tax liability in future years if not resolved favorably 
we have not agreed to these other proposed adjustments and are contesting them through the administrative process 
in the third quarter of  we completed a fast track settlement process with the irs related to certain capital losses that became available for use 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached a formal agreement with the irs through a pre filing agreement to treat certain bad debt expense as a deductible business expense on the federal income tax return 
we have recognized a benefit in for both capital loss and bad debt expense as a result of our resolution with the irs 
during the year ended december   the irs commenced an examination of our and tax returns 
we are also under audit by the california franchise tax board for our and tax returns 
we believe our existing reserves for all tax matters are adequate 
we also filed with the irs amended federal tax returns for our fiscal years to  to elect foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid versus the previous election to deduct foreign taxes from taxable income  reducing income taxes payable by million 
our tax provisions for all years had been computed on the basis of foreign tax credits  and differences between book and 
table of contents tax treatment were charged to additional paid in capital due to the interaction of stock option deductions and the foreign tax credit computations 
accordingly  the million was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital with a corresponding reduction of million in current year income taxes payable and a million receivable from the irs for taxes paid in prior years 
earnings in equity interests 
earnings in equity interests for the year ended december  were approximately million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
earnings in equity interests increased during the year ended december  compared to due primarily to yahoo japan s improved financial performance and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
earnings in equity interests for the year ended december  included a million non cash gain related to alibaba group s ipo of alibaba 
com  net of tax 
in connection with the ipo  we made a direct investment of percent in alibaba 
com  which we sold during the third quarter of for net proceeds of million 
in  we also recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax  within earnings in equity interests to reduce the carrying value of the alibaba 
com investment to fair value

noncontrolling interests 
noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders percentage share of income or losses from the subsidiaries in which we hold a majority  but less than percent  ownership interest and the results of which are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
noncontrolling interests were approximately million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
noncontrolling interests recorded in   and  were mainly related to our yahoo joint venture in australia 
business segment results we manage our business geographically

americas 
americas revenue ex tac for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  compared to our year over year decrease in revenue ex tac was a result of a decline in our search advertising business and our fee based services  partially offset by an increase in our display advertising business 
search advertising revenue ex tac decreased due to the revenue share with microsoft associated with the search agreement and the impact of discontinuing our paid inclusion search product in late as part of our advertising quality initiatives 
these decreases were offset by an increase in display revenue ex tac driven 
table of contents by increased advertising spending and a shift towards higher yielding display inventory by our customers

asia pacific revenue ex tac for the year ended december  remained flat compared to fees revenue increased year over year  but was offset by a decline in our search and display advertising businesses 
the increase in fees revenue was due to increased business as a result of our acquisitions in the asia pacific region during the third quarter of for the year ended december   direct costs attributable to the asia pacific segment decreased million  or percent  compared to the decline is primarily due to decreases in our data center operation expenses and marketing expenses  offset by increases in compensation expenses driven by higher average headcount

table of contents our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
revenue ex tac and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced consolidated revenue and operating expenses 
conversely  our consolidated revenue and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   revenue ex tac for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  revenue ex tac for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and revenue ex tac for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   direct costs for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  direct costs for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and direct costs for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million

as of 
table of contents december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair value below cost due primarily to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities

we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations for the first quarter of we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity because we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support our business operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity  or debt securities  or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders

stock repurchases in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for us to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next five years from the date of authorization  dependent on market conditions  stock price  and other factors 
we repurchase our common stock  from time to time  in part to reduce the dilutive effects of our stock options  awards  and employee stock purchase plan 
repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including derivative transactions  and may be made under a rule b plan

during the year ended december   we entered into an year lease agreement for a data center in the western us of the total expected minimum lease commitment of million  million was classified as an operating lease for real estate and million was classified as a capital lease for equipment 
we are obligated to make minimum payments under contracts to provide sponsored search and or display advertising services to our affiliates  which represent tac 
we are obligated to make payments under various arrangements with vendors and other business partners  principally for marketing  bandwidth  and content arrangements 
as of december   unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties resulted in accrued liabilities of million  of which million is classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million is classified as deferred and other long term tax liabilities  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement period for the million long term income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months 
intellectual property rights 
we are committed to make certain payments under various intellectual property arrangements of up to million through other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  joint venture and business partners  purchasers of assets or subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us  services to be provided by us  intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or  with respect to the sale of assets or a subsidiary  matters related to our conduct of the business and tax matters prior to the sale 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors  and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors and officers of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our condensed consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from display  search  and other 
display revenue is generated from the display of graphical advertisements and search revenue is generated from the display of text based links to an advertiser s website 
other revenue consists of listings based services revenue  transaction revenue  and fees revenue 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple elements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  whether fees are fixed or determinable  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  establishing selling prices for deliverables considering multiple factors  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with certain customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the consideration received from a vendor should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable 
table of contents tax laws 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  new tax legislation  or the change of an estimate based on new information 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
we record a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize these deferred income tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the performance of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value 
an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
our reporting units are based on geography  either at the operating segment level or one level below operating segments 
the fair values of our reporting units are estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent with the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test in the prior year 
in addition  we ensure that the fair values estimated under these two approaches are consistent with each other 
under the market approach  we utilize publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value our reporting units adjusted for an estimated control premium 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including selection of market comparables  estimated future cash flows  and discount rates 
these components are discussed below market comparables we select comparable companies in the specific regions in which our reporting units operate based on similarity of type of business  primarily those involved in online advertising  and relative size of those companies compared to our reporting units 
trailing and forward revenue and earnings multiples derived from these comparable companies are applied to financial metrics of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair values 
estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections for each reporting unit using a five year forecast of cash flows and a terminal value based on the perpetuity growth model 
the five year forecast and related assumptions were derived from the most recent annual financial forecast for which the planning process commenced in our fourth quarter 
key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include  among other items  revenue and operating expense growth rates  terminal value growth rate  and capital expenditure and working capital levels 
discount rates we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine the discount rates used in our cash flow projections 
the determination of the discount rates for each reporting unit includes factors such 
table of contents as the risk free rate of return and the return an outside investor would expect to earn based on the overall level of inherent risk 
the determination of expected returns includes consideration of the beta a measure of risk of traded securities of comparable companies 
the sum of the fair values of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization adjusted for an estimated control premium 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired 
significant management judgment is involved in determining these estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger future impairment 
long lived assets 
we amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
identifiable long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is determined based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future cash flows using discount rates determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect estimated future cash flows relating to our long lived assets which could trigger impairment 
no impairments of long lived assets were identified during any of the periods presented 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in the common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of the entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies  including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows  and other company and industry specific information 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based options  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting award forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 

table of contents therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate this forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our original estimates  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in addition  because many of our stock based awards have vesting schedules of two or three years cliff vests  a significant change in our actual or expected forfeiture experience will result in the adjustment of stock based compensation which was recorded in prior years for all unvested awards 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and marketable debt securities portfolio 
we invest excess cash in money market funds  time deposits  and liquid debt instruments of the us and foreign governments and their agencies  us municipalities  and high credit corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities and cash equivalents 
investments in fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in short term marketable debt securities of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of less than percent for both periods 
as of december  and  we had investments in long term marketable debt securities of approximately million and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent for both periods 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency risk 
revenue and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable 
table of contents period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue  operating expenses  and net income 
conversely  our revenue  operating expenses  and net income will increase if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   revenue for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  revenue for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and revenue for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   direct costs for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  direct costs for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and direct costs for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
as mentioned above  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a gain or loss 
we record these foreign currency transaction gains and losses  realized and unrealized  in other income  net on the condensed consolidated statements of income 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains of million and transaction losses of million  and million  respectively 
investment risk 
we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we have investments in marketable debt securities 
our cash and marketable debt securities investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements 
a large portion of our cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of our investment policy 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of liquid fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized gains and losses on these investments were not material 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale or investment in equity interests 
these investments may be subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
our investments in available for sale equity securities amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale investments were not material in during the year ended december   we realized gains of million related to the sale of our investment in gmarket 
during the year ended december   we sold our direct investment in alibaba 
com for net proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million in other income  net 
our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
using a hypothetical reduction of percent in the stock price of these available for sale investments  the fair value of our equity investments would decrease by less than million as of both december  and
