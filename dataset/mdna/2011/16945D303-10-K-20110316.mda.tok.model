critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements 
these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inh erently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the functional currency is chinese renminbi  however the accompanying financial statements have been translated and presented in united states dollars 

index principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of china yida and its wholly owned subsidiaries keenway limited  hong kong yi tat  fujian jintai  fuyu  hongda  fujian yidatulou  fujian yintai  anhui yida  yongtai yunding  jiangxi zhangshu  jiangxi fenyi and the accounts of its variable interest entity  fujian jiaoguang media 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
consolidation of variable interest entities according to the requirements of asc  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
that requires a variable interest entity vie  the company has evaluated the economic relationships of fujian jiaoguang which signed an exclusive right agreement with the company 
therefore  fujian jiaoguang is considered to be a vie  as defined by asc topic  of which the company is the primary beneficiary 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  actual results could differ materially from those results 
the most significant estimates include depreciation  useful lives of property and equipment  deferred income taxes  useful life of intangible assets and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal 
the cost of improvements that extends the life of property  and equipment are capitalized 
these capitalized costs may include structural improvements  equipment  and fixtures 
all ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows building years electronic equipment to years transportation equipment years office furniture to years leasehold improvement lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets impairment the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the company tests long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangible assets and construction in progress  for recoverability at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  the company measures the amount of impairmen t by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows as the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 

index revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the date of service rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the services rendered  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue 
net revenue represents gross revenue net of value added tax vat 
revenues from advance resort ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used 
revenues from our contractors who have tourism contracts with us are generally recognized over the period of the applicable agreements commencing with the tourists visiting the resort 
the company also sells admission and activities tickets for a resort which the company has the management right 
the company sells the television air time to third parties 
the company records advertising sales when advertisements are aired 
the company has no allowance for product returns or sales discounts because services that are rendered and accepted by the customers are normally not refundable and discounts are normally not granted after service has been rendered 
foreign currency translation the company uses the united states dollar us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the company subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency  being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted 
in general  for consolidation purposes  the company translates the subsidiaries assets and liabilities into us dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates  and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods 
gain or loss on foreign currency transactions are reflected on the income statement 
gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part  of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries in china is the chinese renminbi 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company applied the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the company s liability for income taxes 
any such adjustment could be material to the company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based  in part  upon the results of operations for the given period 
fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for current assets and currently liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these financial instruments 

index in  the company adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
this standard defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
this standard does not require any new fair value measurements  but discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flows and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
for purposes of asc  nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets a nd liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in asc a 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation expense pursuant to asc  share based payment arrangement  which requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee requisite service period 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of company s stock or the expected volatility of similar entities 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest  and there were no estimated forfeitures as the company has a short history of issuing options 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued new guidance regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the new guidance provides an amendment to its consolidation guidance for variable interest entities and the definition of a variable interest entity and requires enhanced disclosures to provide more information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this amendment also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is effective january  the company adopted this guidance on january  which had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  fasb issued an amendment regarding improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this new guidance requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
there was no impact from the adoption of this guidance to our consolidated financial position or results of operations as the amendment only addresses disclosures 
in april  fasb issued an amendment to stock compensation 
the amendment clarifies that an employee stock based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity shares trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not anticipate any impact from our adoption of this guidance since our stock based payment awards have an exercise price denominated in the same currency of the market in which our company shares are traded 
inflation and seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been materially affected by inflation or seasonality 

index off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  sales or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to an investment in our securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclousures about market risk not applicable because the fiscal year ended december  is our first year being as an accelerated filer and our disclosure obligations shall follow the disclosure requirements as a small reporting company until the second fiscal year as being an accelerated filer 
this section is not applicable to small reporting companies
