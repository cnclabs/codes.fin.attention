precimed was a leading technology driven supplier to the orthopaedic industry 
the results of precimed s operations were included in our greatbatch medical business from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price and other direct costs of precimed totaled million  which we paid in cash 
total assets acquired from precimed were million  of which million were intangible assets  including million of in process research and development ipr d which we immediately expensed  and million of goodwill 
on february   precimed completed its previously announced acquisition of depuy orthopaedics depuy chaumont  france manufacturing facility the chaumont facility 
the chaumont facility produces hip and shoulder implants for depuy ireland who distributes them worldwide through various depuy selling entities 
this transaction included a new four year supply agreement with depuy 
the results of the chaumont facility s operations were included in our greatbatch medical business from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price and other direct costs of the chaumont facility totaled million  which we paid in cash 
total assets acquired from the chaumont facility were million  of which million was goodwill 
going forward  we will continue to pursue strategically targeted and opportunistic acquisitions 
our customers our products are designed to provide reliable  long lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers and the end users of their products 
the nature and extent of our selling relationships with each customer are different in terms of breadth of products purchased  purchased product volumes  length of contractual commitment  ordering patterns  inventory management and selling prices

in february  we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with medtronic  inc  which secured volume commitments for several products  including coated components and our optiseal valved peelable introducer 
the medtronic mou also extends our previous supply agreement with medtronic for shield assemblies  which was set to expire in april  for three years  in return for certain price reductions 
in the first quarter of  we completed negotiations with boston scientific on a new long term supply agreement pursuant to which boston scientific will continue to purchase a certain percentage of batteries  capacitors  filtered feedthroughs  case halves and leads it uses in or with its imds through this agreement replaces the previous contract between the two companies that expired on december   and expands the depth of the relationship by adding products from our vascular access systems platform 

table of contents in june  we extended our feedthrough agreement with st 
jude medical through under the terms of the agreement we are guaranteed of st jude medical s feedthrough and filtering business  and of their implantable pulse generator mri filtered feedthrough business in exchange for certain price reductions 
our electrochem customers are primarily companies involved in demanding markets where highly sophisticated power solutions or wireless sensing needs exist  such as energy  military  portable medical and environmental monitoring 
some of our larger oem customers include halliburton company  weatherford international  general electric  thales  zoll medical corp 
and scripps institution of oceanography 
strategic and financial overview over three years ago we initiated a diversification strategy in order to enter into new higher growth markets and provide a more stable foundation from which to grow over the long term 
the benefits of this strategy were evident in as recoveries in our vascular access  orthopaedic and electrochem product lines offset the slow down in the crm market 
as a result  sales for were million or above the prior year 
further evidence of the benefits of this strategy was the reduction in crm and neuromodulation revenue to of our total sales in compared to in additionally  the concentration of sales to our top three customers in the crm market was reduced to of revenues in  versus for those same three customers in during  revenue totaled million  or million lower than  which included approximately million of additional revenue as a result of an extra week of operations 
during  crm neuromodulation revenue grew and was offset by decreases in orthopaedic  vascular access and electrochem revenue  which were impacted by the economic downturn and uncertain health care environment 
over this time  we have also focused on integrating our acquisitions and streamlining our operations 
the benefits of these initiatives can be seen in our gross margin improvement to in from for  excluding inventory step up amortization  and our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declining to of total sales in from in the benefits of these initiatives can also be seen in the substantial increase in our cash flow from operating activities from million in to million in  excluding the settlement of the electrochem litigation see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
this excess cash flow helped to fund the repayment of debt  which totaled approximately million over the last three years 
we have now repaid over half of the debt assumed from our acquisitions in and and anticipate having sufficient capital to fund our future investment and growth plans 
in addition to growing and diversifying our revenue base and driving operating performance  over the past three years we have also made significant investments in research  development and engineering rd e to provide innovative solutions to our customers 
this included investments in systems and device products of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as a result  net rd e costs increased to of total sales in compared to in in  we expect to begin to see the financial benefit of these investments as the products we are working on with shorter development lead times  primarily in the vascular access market  will begin to commercialize 
we expect the growth and cadence of new product introductions to accelerate over the next several years as our longer lead time systems and device products  which we have invested in over the last three years  will also begin to commercialize 
the investments we have made in streamlining and consolidating our operations have provided the cash flow to support these investments and have provided us with sufficient manufacturing capacity for future production of these products 

table of contents from to  we incurred costs related to the implementation of numerous cost savings  consolidation and integration initiatives 
additionally  during  we accrued million in connection with the electrochem litigation  of which million was reversed in the fourth quarter of upon settlement of this litigation  and incurred a million tradename write down due to the successful rebranding of our greatbatch medical segment 
during  we incurred ipr d charges and inventory step up amortization expense related to our acquisitions of million 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
additionally  we consistently report and discuss in our quarterly earnings releases and investor presentations adjusted operating income and margin  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share 
these adjusted amounts consist of gaap amounts excluding i acquisition related charges  ii facility consolidation  manufacturing transfer and system integration charges  iii asset write down and disposition charges  iv severance charges in connection with corporate realignments or a general reduction in force v litigation charges and gains  vi the impact of non cash charges to interest expense due to the accounting change governing convertible debt  vii unusual or infrequently occurring items and viii the income tax benefit related to these adjustments 
we believe that reporting these amounts provides important supplemental information to our investors and creditors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the performance based compensation of our executive management is determined utilizing these adjusted amounts 
a reconciliation of gaap operating income to adjusted operating income is as follows in thousands year ended december  january  january  operating income as reported executive death benefits sg a consolidation costs integration costs asset dispositions  severance and other electrochem litigation charge gain intangible asset write down acquired ipr d acquisition charges inventory step up operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted our goal is to continuously improve adjusted operating margin over the next three to five years through our initiatives to improve operating performance and through the development of innovative products to drive future revenue growth  including systems and device products 
evidence of the progress we have made in these initiatives can be seen in the improvement of adjusted operating margin from to our adjusted operating margin is expected to be between and for adjusted operating income for is expected to consist of gaap operating income less million to million of adjustments 

table of contents a reconciliation of gaap income loss before taxes to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  january  january  income loss before taxes as reported executive death benefits sg a consolidation costs integration costs asset dispositions  severance and other electrochem litigation charge gain intangible asset write down acquired ipr d acquisition charges inventory step up sub total csn ii conversion option discount amortization gain on extinguishment of debt sale of investment security adjusted income before taxes adjusted provision for income taxes adjusted net income adjusted diluted eps number of shares a a adjusted shares outstanding used for calculating adjusted diluted eps for and include the dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards and our convertible subordinated notes of  and  respectively  that were not dilutive for gaap purposes

adjusted diluted eps is gaap diluted eps excluding the after tax impact of the adjusted amounts described above  million million net of tax of non cash convertible debt interest expense  and approximately million million net of tax gain from the previously disclosed sale of our intelect medical investment 
this guidance also assumes that our effective tax rate will be approximately and our average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately million 
government regulation in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively health care reform legislating broad based changes to the us health care system 
health care reform could significantly impact our business operations and financial results  including higher or lower revenue  as well as higher employee medical costs and taxes 
many significant parts of health care reform will be phased in over the next eight years and require further guidance and clarification in the form of regulations 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known until those regulations are enacted  which we expect to occur over the next several years 

table of contents on january   the us department of transportation  and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  hazardous materials transportation of lithium batteries in the federal register 
pmhsa  in conjunction with the federal aviation administration is proposing to amend requirements in the hazardous materials regulations on the transportation of lithium cells and batteries  including lithium cell and batteries packed with or contained in equipment 
we are actively monitoring this rulemaking process because of the potential negative effect the rule  as currently proposed  could have on our greatbatch medical and electrochem businesses 
product development we are developing a series of new products for applications in the markets we serve  such as develop systems and device solutions for our customers in the markets we operate in  continued development of mri compatible leadwires and other neuromodulation products  continued development of higher energy higher density capacitors  the design of next generation steerable catheters  sheaths and introducers  further develop minimally invasive surgical techniques for the orthopaedic industry  develop disposable instrumentation for the orthopaedic industry  provide wireless sensing solutions to electrochem customers  and develop a charging platform for electrochem s secondary offering 
as a result of the investments we have made over the last three years  we are now able to provide our customers with full systems and device solutions 
this includes development and regulatory submissions  as well as manufacturing and supporting worldwide distribution 
these systems and devices are full product solutions that complement our oem customers products and utilize our component expertise and capabilities 
this strategy includes partnering with our oem customers  including sharing technology and resources  in order to bring these solutions to market 
the benefits to our oem customers include shortening the time to market for these products by accelerating the velocity of innovation  optimizing their supply chain and ultimately providing them with cost efficiencies 
in  greatbatch medical received clearance from the us food and drug administration for its optiseal valved peelable introducer 
we also received approval in canada and ce marking for distribution in europe 
optiseal is significant in that it represents the first k regulatory clearance received under the greatbatch medical brand and is the first product commercialized in connection with our systems and device strategy 
we expect to make additional system and device product announcements in the initial announcements are expected to center around products we are developing for the vascular access market but longer term will include the crm  neuromodulation and orthopaedic markets 
ultimately our goal is to establish a cadence of system and device product announcements that will provide us incremental revenue growth as well as increased margins 
our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used valuation of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including ipr d when we acquire a company  we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair value at the date of acquisition  including ipr d 
intangible assets  such as trademarks and tradenames  are considered non amortizing intangible assets as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized but are required to be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequent if certain indicators are present 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of risk adjusted cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  attrition trends  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
we perform an annual review on the last day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income and market approaches 
indefinite lived intangible assets such as trademarks and tradenames are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach 
definite lived intangible assets such as purchased technology  patents and customer lists are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we do not believe that the greatbatch tradename or goodwill allocated to our greatbatch medical or electrochem segments are at risk of failing step one of future annual impairment tests unless operating conditions significantly deteriorate 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations 
in arriving at the value of the ipr d  we additionally consider among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  commercial feasibility of the project  the complexity of the work completed  the projected costs to complete and commercialize the project  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the value of the assets and liabilities recorded  which would change the amount and timing of future intangible asset amortization expense 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the expected future cash flows of our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
these include discount rates  terminal values and projections of future revenues and expenses 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could create future impairment losses to our goodwill 
the assumptions used in our impairment test incorporate growth rates disclosed in sales outlook of this section 
for trademarks and tradenames  we make estimates of royalty rates  future revenues and discount rates 
significant changes in these estimates could create future impairments of these indefinite lived intangible assets 
estimation of the useful lives of indefinite and definite lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated cash flows of the respective intangible asset and requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates of the useful lives 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future amortization expense or could create future impairments of these intangible assets 
as of december   we have million of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
this includes million of amortizing intangible assets  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of goodwill 
a change in the amortization of our intangible assets would change net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used stock based compensation we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance awards based on company metrics is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
compensation cost for performance awards based on market metrics such as total shareholder return is expensed each period whether the performance metrics are achieved or not 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest  excluding market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest  excluding market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
we are required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected black scholes model inputs  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of stock options granted  which represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding  is based  primarily  on historical data 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
the fair value of time based as well as nonmarket based performance restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is equal to the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of market based performance restricted stock unit awards is determined by utilizing a monte carlo simulation model  which projects the value of greatbatch stock versus our peer group under numerous scenarios and determines the value of the award based upon the present value of these projected outcomes 
compensation cost for nonmarket based performance awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
that assessment is based upon actual and expected future performance 
stock based compensation expense is only recorded for those awards that are expected to vest  excluding market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
forfeiture estimates for determining appropriate stock based compensation expense are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and demographic characteristics 
revisions are made to those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting assumptions to be utilized to determine fair value and forfeiture assumptions 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods  the expense that we record for future grants may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
additionally  changes in performance of the company and its stock price will affect the likelihood that performance based targets are achieved and could materially impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
a change in our stock based compensation expense would increase decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
inventory costing requires complex calculations that include assumptions for overhead absorption  scrap  sample calculations  manufacturing yield estimates and the determination of which costs may be capitalized 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs or expense a greater amount of overhead costs  which would have a negative impact on our net income 
as of december  we have million of inventory recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down of our inventory would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
tangible long lived assets property  plant and equipment and other tangible long lived assets are carried at cost 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets primarily using straight line rates 
tangible long lived assets are subject to impairment assessment if certain indicators are present 
we assess the impairment of tangible long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of the asset asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability potential is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset asset group to the related total future undiscounted cash flows 
the projected cash flows for each asset asset group considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  proceeds from the sale of the asset asset group  reasonable contract renewal assumptions  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
if an asset s assets group s carrying value is not recoverable through related cash flows  the asset asset group is considered to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the asset s asset group s carrying amount to its fair value 
when it is determined that useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their shorter useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of tangible assets that are long lived requires significant management judgment 
events could occur  including changes in cash flow that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long lived assets 
also  as we make manufacturing process conversions and other facility consolidation decisions  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of our assets  primarily manufacturing equipment and buildings 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future depreciation expense or could create future impairments of these long lived assets asset groups 
as of december  we have million of tangible long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down in our tangible long lived assets would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used provision for income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse 
in relation to recording the provision for income taxes  management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of temporary differences based upon the timing of expected reversal 
also  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
alternatively  we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances 
changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby changing the income tax provision 
also  significant declines in taxable income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and a valuation allowance of million has been established for certain deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
a percentage point change in the effective tax rate would impact the current year provision for income taxes by million  and diluted earnings per share by per diluted share 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of statutes of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
cost savings and consolidation efforts in  and we recorded charges in other operating expenses  net in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with approximately twenty cost savings and consolidation initiatives 
these initiatives were undertaken to improve our operational efficiencies and profitability 
additional information regarding the timing  cash flow and amount of future expenditures is set forth in note other operating expenses  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
in january  we announced our intention to construct an  square foot manufacturing facility in allen county  in 
total investment in this facility is expected to be approximately million 
we intend to transfer the manufacturing operations currently being performed at our columbia city  in location into this new facility once construction is complete 
additionally  the allen county facility will provide us with increased capabilities and capacity for future growth 
this is the third project we have deployed as part of an overall strategy to partner with orthopaedic device makers 
in  we launched the first phase of a state of the art orthopaedic design center in warsaw  in  providing customers with rapid prototyping capabilities to develop and deliver effective solutions quickly

for the year  crm and neuromodulation sales were consistent with the prior year as higher volumes were offset by continued pressure from oem customers on pricing and dual sourcing vertical integration initiatives 
more specifically  higher battery  capacitor and assembly revenue were offset by lower feedthrough and enclosure sales 
battery and capacitor sales for were impacted by customer inventory adjustments and  as expected  returned to more normalized levels in crm revenue is significantly impacted each period due to the timing of various customer product launches  shifts in customer market share  customer inventory management initiatives as well as marketplace field actions 
we expect the pressures on crm revenue experienced in to continue to impact sales in for  vascular access sales increased primarily due to higher introducer and catheter sales 
we expect vascular access revenue growth to continue to accelerate in as we launch several new systems products 
orthopaedic product line sales of million for were above the comparable period 
this increase was across all of our orthopaedic products as the markets continued to recover from the slowdown in and as our investments and expanded capabilities have begun to deliver new business  which included our new rapid prototyping facility  pilot line and spine implant and reconstructive implant capabilities 
for the year  orthopaedic sales include approximately million of negative foreign currency exchange rate impact in comparison to electrochem sales for the electrochem business segment were million  an increase of million or compared to this increase from the prior year primarily related to the recovery in the energy and portable medical markets from the slowdown in  which caused customers to reduce inventory levels and push back projects 
additionally  electrochem sales benefited from the sales and marketing initiatives undertaken during the economic downturn  which positioned us to capture market share once the markets recovered 
sales outlook annual revenue product line growth rates are expected to be as follows crm neuromodulation flat vascular access to orthopaedic to electrochem to 
table of contents by applying these growth rates to our results  consolidated annual sales for are projected to be in the range of approximately million to million 
these growth projections may be impacted by a variety of factors including a continued softening in the crm market  changes in pricing or exchange rates  changes in health care reimbursement policies  further dual sourcing vertical integration initiatives by our customers and other factors described in cautionary factors that may affect future results contained in item of this report 
gross profit changes to gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the following increase capacity productivity a selling price b mix change c other total percentage point change to gross profit as a percentage of sales a our gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by excess capacity costs due to our increased infrastructure investment in our orthopaedic business in comparison to modest productivity improvement initiatives partially offset these excess capacity costs 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  excess capacity costs are expensed 
b our gross profit percentage was negatively impacted in by contractual volume price reductions and price concessions made to our larger oem customers on certain product lines 
we expect this pricing pressure to continue in the future 
c our gross profit percentage was positively impacted by an increase in sales of higher margin products as a percentage of total sales  primarily within our crm  vascular access and electrochem product lines 
for  we expect that our gross profit margin will continue to improve as our higher margin systems and device products ramp up and as volumes improve 
sg a expenses changes to sg a expenses were primarily due to the following in thousands decrease personnel costs a information technology and consulting b allowance for doubtful accounts c other decrease in sg a a amounts reflect our consolidation and cost reduction initiatives 
a portion of these cost savings were reinvested in rd e 
sg a expenses for include million of death benefits provided to the family of the company s former senior vice president orthopaedics 
b amounts represent the change in information technology and consulting costs from and reflect our cost reduction initiatives 
c amounts primarily relate to lower losses incurred on uncollectible receivables compared to  which included higher electrochem and orthopaedic write offs due to the economic slowdown
