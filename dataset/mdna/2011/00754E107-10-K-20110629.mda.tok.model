item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis md a  including  without limitation  statements containing the words may  will  can  anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  continue  and similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risks described in the risk factors sections and elsewhere in this filing 
except for our ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we do not intend to update you concerning any future revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
global economic conditions in recent years  the credit and financial markets have experienced significant volatility characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities and commodities prices and currency rates  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  concern over the economic stability of certain economies in europe and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments  as applicable 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term or widespread recession  unemployment  energy costs  geopolitical issues including government deficits  the availability and cost of credit  and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies 
while recent economic data reflect some stabilization of the economy and credit markets  the cost and availability of credit may continue to reflect volatility and uncertainty 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and global economies could restrict our ability and the ability of our customers to refinance indebtedness  increase the costs of borrowing  limit access to capital necessary to meet liquidity needs and materially harm operations or the ability to implement planned business strategies 
with respect to our customers  these factors could also negatively impact the timing and amount of infrastructure spending  further negatively impacting our sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of company s financial condition and results of operations is based on its condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain prior year balances have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory cost adjustments  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is derived principally from the sales of the company s products 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a purchase order  when shipment has occurred since its terms are fob source  or when services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and no post shipment obligations or uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides warranty repairs at no cost 
the length of the warranty term is one year from date of shipment 
the company accrues the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs 
the company s management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
the company does not provide price protection or general right of return 
the company s return policy only permits product returns for warranty and non warranty repair or replacement and requires pre authorization by the company prior to the return 
credit or discounts  which have been historically insignificant  may be given at the discretion of the company and are recorded when and if determined 
the company predominantly sells directly to original equipment manufacturers with a direct sales force 
the company sells in limited circumstances through distributors 
sales through distributors represent approximately of total fiscal revenue 
significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return or exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product transfers title to the distributor at the time of shipment by the company  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
revenue is also derived from technology research and development contracts 
we recognize revenue from these contracts as services and or materials are provided 
impairment of long lived assets as of march  and march   our consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our business acquisitions 
goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount  as defined 
this guidance requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company has selected march as the date for its annual impairment test 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to consider inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that our market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company to our market capitalization 
the company s evaluation as of march  and march   indicated there were no impairments 
as of march   our market capitalization calculated as described as above  was million and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
as of march   our market capitalization  calculated as described above  was million and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
we applied a control premium to market capitalization to determine a fair value of million 
we believe that including a control premium at this level is supported by recent transaction data in our industry 
absent the inclusion of a control premium  our carrying value would have exceeded fair value  requiring a step two analysis which may have resulted in an impairment of goodwill 
as evidenced above  our stock price and control premium are significant factors in assessing our fair value for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment 
our stock price can be affected by  among other things  changes in industry or market conditions  changes in our results of operations  and changes in our forecasts or market expectations relating to future results 
our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of during the fourth quarter of fiscal on all trading days during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our stock price was high enough that our market capitalization exceeded our carrying value without giving effect to a control premium 
the current macroeconomic environment  however  continues to be challenging and we cannot be certain of the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on our stock price performance 
if our market capitalization falls below our carrying value for a sustained period  it is reasonably likely that a goodwill impairment assessment prior to the next annual review in the fourth quarter of fiscal would be necessary and an impairment of goodwill may be recorded 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge would have the affect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period 
the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its then estimated fair value 
as a result of the current year operating loss  the company performed an impairment evaluation 
the company s evaluation for the fiscal year ended march  indicated there were no impairments 
accounting for income taxes income tax provisions and benefits are made for taxes currently payable or refundable  and for deferred income taxes arising from future tax consequences of events that were recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in accordance with fasb guidance pertaining to accounting for income taxes 
as part our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent operating results and our forecasting process 
the company forecasts taxable income through its budgeting and planning process each year 
the process takes into account existing contracts  firm sales backlog  and projected sales based upon customer supplied forecasts of product purchases its design wins  company resources needed to fulfill these customers requirements  and extraordinary expenses that may be part of long term initiatives to increase shareholder value through revenue growth and efficiency improvements leading to profit improvement 
the company has substantial history  more than years in most cases  with its customers and its market on which its forecasts are based 
at march   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and million for state income tax purposes that expire at various dates through fiscal year the tax laws related to the utilization of loss carry forwards are complex and the amount of the company s loss carry forward that will ultimately be available to offset future taxable income may be subject to annual limitations under internal revenue code irc section resulting from changes in the ownership of the company s common stock 
the company performed an analysis to determine whether an ownership change under irc section had occurred 
the effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of the net operating loss carry forwards attributable to periods before the change 
as of march   the company believes there are no limitations on the use of these federal nols 
at march   the company s net deferred tax asset before consideration of a valuation allowance was approximately million  mainly consisting of net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company has determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  primarily due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards before they expire based on the negative evidence of its recent years history of losses  including tax losses in two of the last three years and cumulative taxable losses over the past three years  outweighing the positive evidence of taxable income projections in future years 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or within the periods before nol carry forwards expire 
as of both march  and  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax 
the calculation of federal income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step involves evaluating the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step involves estimating and measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
the company has taken no tax positions which would require disclosure 
although the irs is not currently examining any of our income tax returns  tax years to remain open and are subject to examination 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year to assess whether a cost adjustment is required 
our review of slow moving and obsolete inventory begins with a listing of all inventory items which have not moved regularly within the past months 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is included in the list 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then further assessed and a write down is recorded when warranted 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may also be written down 
impairments for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also recorded 
the impairments established for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory create a new cost basis for those items 
the cost basis of these parts is not subsequently increased if the circumstances which led to the impairment change in the future 
if a product that had previously been impaired is subsequently sold  the amount of reduced cost basis is reflected as cost of goods sold 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march revenues the company predominantly operates in one industry segment  light and radiation detection devices that it sells to multiple markets including telecommunications  industrial sensing ndt  military aerospace  medical  and homeland security 
revenues by market consisted of the following year ended march  march  telecommunications industrial sensing ndt military aerospace medical homeland security total revenues the company revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million for fiscal the company experienced increases in four of our five markets during fiscal telecommunications sales were million  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase in the company s telecommunications revenues for fiscal was the result of our product development investment over the past few years and rapid growth in the g and emerging g markets

the company expects homeland security revenues for fiscal year to grow substantially as a result of this development contract 
gross profit gross profit was million or of revenue  compared to the prior year of million of revenue 
the higher gross profit in dollars was due primarily to increased volume and product mix  offset partially by higher scrap and rework expenses associated with the manufacturing ramp up of g and g line side products

the company s evaluations of intangible assets and goodwill for the years ended march  and resulted in no impairment adjustments 
financing and other income expense  net interest income for fiscal decreased  to approximately  compared to  in fiscal  due primarily to lower cash balances available for short term investment and lower interest rates in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  primarily attributable to lower interest rates and reduced debt obligations 
for the year ended march   the company incurred other expense of  on the change in fair value of the warrant liability  compared to other income of  for the year ended march  fasb guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities requires our outstanding warrants to be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
the company compared the fair values determined using the black scholes model with that using a lattice model  which is generally a preferred model when instruments contain non standard features such as the reset features contained in our warrants  noting no significant differences in warrant values 
to the extent that the fair value of the warrant liability increases or decreases  the company records an expense or income in its statements of operations 
the expense of  related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability for fiscal is due to the increase in the stock price  expected volatility  interest rates and contractual life of the warrants which are the primary assumptions applied to the black scholes model used to calculate the fair value of the warrants

net loss for fiscal was million per share  as compared to net loss of million per share in fiscal  a decrease in loss of million 
the decrease in losses for the year were primarily attributable to higher revenue offset partially by an increase in cost associated with new product revenue and increased r d expenses in the growth product platforms

the company performed an assessment of the fifth amendment made to the picometrix notes and determined that the fifth amendment constituted a substantial modification in accordance with fasb guidance as the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the fifth amendment  combined with the fair value of the consideration given as part of the spa  was more than different than the present value of cash flows under the prior amendment to the picometrix notes 
as a result  the company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of  which is equal to the  restructuring fee and the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the spa which was  at november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the warrants
