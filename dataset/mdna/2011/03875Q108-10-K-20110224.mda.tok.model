item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k 
overview historically  our quantitative radio ratings services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue 
our radio audience ratings services and the related software revenues represented percent  percent  and percent of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
while we expect that our quantitative radio ratings services and related software will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by  among other things  leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm technology by exploring applications of the technology beyond our domestic radio ratings business 
as of december   we completed our previously announced plan to commercialize our ppm radio ratings service in of the largest united states radio markets 
according to our analysis of bia s investing in radio market report  those broadcasters with whom we have entered into multi year ppm agreements account for most of the total radio advertising dollars in the ppm markets 
these agreements generally provide for a higher fee for ppm based ratings than we charge for diary based ratings 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from our radio ratings and related software is likely to increase as a result of the commercialization of the ppm service in these markets 
growth in revenue is expected for due to a full year impact of revenue recognized for the ppm markets commercialized prior to however  the full revenue impact of the launch of each ppm market is not expected to occur within the first year after commercialization because our customer contracts allow for phased in pricing toward the higher ppm service rate over a period of time 
due to the high penetration of our current services in the radio broadcasting business  we expect that our future annual organic rate of revenue growth from our quantitative diary based radio ratings services will be slower than historical trends 
we depend on a limited number of key customers for our radio ratings services and related software 
for example  in  clear channel represented percent of our total revenue 
we cannot provide any assurances that we could replace the revenue that would be lost if any of our key customers failed to renew all or part of their agreements with us or became insolvent 
the loss of any key customer would materially impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
we continue to operate in a highly challenging business environment 
our future performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and industries we serve  including our ability to continue to maintain and improve the quality of our ppm ratings service  and manage increased costs for data collection  arising among other ways  from increased numbers of cell phone households  which are more expensive for us to recruit than households with landline phones  and in person recruiting 
because we intend to continue to increase the number of cell phone households in our samples  as well as participate in targeted in person recruiting  we believe these quality improvement initiatives will be a significant component of our operating costs 
we currently anticipate that the total costs of cell phone household recruitment for both the ppm and diary services  as well as the costs of in person recruiting for the ppm service  will be approximately million in we maintain an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement and obtaining and or maintaining mrc accreditation in all of our ppm markets  and strive to develop and implement effective and efficient technological solutions to measure cross platform media and advertising 
protecting and supporting our existing customer base  and ensuring our services are competitive from a price  quality and service perspective are critical components to these overall goals  although there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts 
credit facility our revolving credit facility agreement is scheduled to expire on december   and as a result  our million outstanding borrowing under that agreement was reclassified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet in december see liquidity and capital resources credit facility below for further information regarding the terms of our revolving credit facility 
general economic conditions our customers derive most of their revenue from transactions involving the sale or purchase of advertising 
during recent challenging economic times  advertisers have reduced advertising expenditures  impacting advertising agencies and media 
as a result  advertising agencies and media companies have been and may continue to be less likely to purchase our services  which has and could continue to adversely impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
continued market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns  which also may lead to lower demand for our services or to our customers that have expiring contracts with us not to renew or to renew for fewer services  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  insolvency  or bankruptcy of our customers  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
as compared to our historical trends  we have experienced an increase in the average number of days our sales have been outstanding before we have received payment and a material increase in trade accounts receivable 
if the recovery from the recent economic downturn slows or if the economy experiences another downturn in the foreseeable future  it may also lead to an increase of incidences of customers inability to pay their accounts  an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  and a further increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or insolvency of our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that both are important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations  and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
software development costs 
we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
as of december   and  our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm service 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets inaccurate 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we include  in our tax calculation methodology  an assessment of the uncertainty in income taxes by establishing recognition thresholds for our tax positions 
inherent in our calculation are critical judgments by management related to the determination of the basis for our tax positions 
for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
insurance receivables 
during  we became involved in two securities law civil actions and a governmental interaction primarily related to the commercialization of our ppm service 
since  we have incurred a combined total of million in legal fees and expenses in connection with these matters 
as of december   million in insurance reimbursements related to these legal actions were received 
as of december  and  our insurance claims receivable related to these legal actions was million and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our insurance recovery receivables

revenue 
revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher fees charged for ppm based ratings than for diary based ratings within the ppm markets commercialized 
ppm based ratings service revenue increased by million primarily due to the partial year impact of the ppm markets commercialized during and the full year impact of the ppm markets commercialized in  as well as price escalators in all ppm commercialized markets 
included in the above net increase in revenue related to our ppm service is a million decrease in pre currency revenue from million for ppm markets commercialized during to million for the smaller ppm markets commercialized during this increase in ppm revenue was substantially offset by a million decrease in revenue related to the transition from our diary based ratings service  as well as a million reduction in revenue associated with two customers  primarily attributable to cumulus but also including clear channel  for our diary based radio ratings service in a limited number of small and medium sized markets 
ppm international revenue decreased by million largely due to decreased equipment sales 
included in the above fluctuations in revenue related to our diary based ratings service and our ppm ratings service is a million aggregate decrease in revenue from customers  including univision  that were subscribers in but either did not subscribe or reduced their level of subscribed services in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in cost of revenue increased primarily due to million of increased ppm service related costs incurred to build and manage ppm panels for the ppm markets commercialized as of december   as compared to the ppm markets commercialized as of december  in addition  we incurred million of increased costs associated with our cross platform services and million of increased recruitment costs related to cell phone household recruiting for both the diary and ppm services and targeted in person recruiting for our ppm service 
recruitment costs are expected to increase as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our samples 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease for ppm international related to lower revenues 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in selling  general  and administrative decreased primarily due to a million decrease in selling and marketing expenses resulting from cost containment and reduction initiatives  a million net decrease in non cash share based compensation resulting primarily from ceo successions during and  and a million decrease in legal fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in severance charges  and a million supplemental retirement plan settlement loss incurred during the first quarter of research and development 
research and development decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in research and development decreased primarily due to a million reduction in development costs related to our ppm service  a million reduction in development costs related to cross platform services  and a million decrease associated with the development of our client software 
restructuring and reorganization 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent of our full time employees 
no restructuring expenses were incurred during  as compared to million of pre tax restructuring charges  related principally to severance  termination benefits  outplacement support  and certain other expenses in connection with our restructuring plan 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to a state tax benefit recognized as a result from a favorable state tax ruling received during the fourth quarter of ebit and ebitda 
we believe that presenting ebit and ebitda  both non gaap financial measures  as supplemental information helps investors  analysts and others  if they so choose  in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in some of the same ways that we do because ebit and ebitda exclude certain items that are not directly related to our core operating performance 
we reference these non gaap financial measures in assessing current performance and making decisions about internal budgets  resource allocation and financial goals 
ebit is calculated by deducting interest income from net income and adding back interest expense and income tax expense to net income 
ebitda is calculated by deducting interest income from net income and adding back interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization to net income 
ebit and ebitda should not be considered substitutes either for net income  as indicators of our operating performance  or for cash flow  as measures of our liquidity 
in addition  because ebit and ebitda may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebit increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher revenue in while total costs and expenses were relatively unchanged 
ebitda increased by or million because this non gaap financial measure excludes depreciation and amortization  which for increased by million as compared to comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the following table sets forth information with respect to our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands  except per share amounts unaudited years ended increase percentage december  decrease of revenue dollars percent revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring and reorganization total costs and expenses operating income equity in net income of affiliate s income from continuing operations before interest and tax expense interest income interest expense income from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of gain on sale  net of taxes total loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income income per weighted average common share basic continuing operations discontinued operations net income per share  basic diluted continuing operations discontinued operations net income per share  diluted cash dividends declared per common share certain per share data and percentage amounts may not total due to rounding

the increase in revenue due to ppm market commercialization was largely offset by a million decrease related to the transition from our diary based ratings service 
ppm international sales increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to these net increases were partially offset by a million reduction in revenue associated with two customers  primarily cumulus  inc  for our diary based radio ratings service in a limited number of small and medium sized markets 
the growth rate of our ratings revenue was also diminished due to decreased demand for discretionary services  such as software and qualitative data services  in the currently challenging economic environment 
revenue associated with these two qualitative services decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to cost of revenue increased due to million of increased ppm service related costs  including million in increased cell phone only household recruitment for our ppm service  incurred to build and manage ppm panels for the ppm markets commercialized in total as of december   as compared to the ppm markets commercialized as of december  in addition  we spent million on cell phone only household recruitment initiatives for our diary service during and million in increased costs incurred during the year ended december   to support the increased infrastructure within our computer center 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in diary data collection and processing costs  excluding diary cell phone only household recruitment  as a result of the transition from our diary service to the ppm service in certain markets  and a million decrease associated with labor cost reductions resulting from our restructuring initiative 
scarborough royalty costs decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to  due to the decreased demand for discretionary services  such as software and qualitative data services 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expense decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to a million decrease related to cost savings incurred as a result of our restructuring and reorganization plan  a million decrease in net legal costs and a million decrease in employee incentive compensation expense 
these decreases in selling  general  and administrative expense were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of million  a million insurance recovery reversal associated with an insurance claim settlement for certain legal matters and governmental interactions  and a million increase in our bad debt expense primarily due to the impact of the declining economy for the year ended december   as compared to restructuring and reorganization 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent of our full time employees

we expect to renew or replace our revolving credit facility prior to december   the credit facility s expiration date 
see credit facility for further discussion of the relevant terms and covenants 
operating activities 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to million in ebitda  as discussed and reconciled to net income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  partially offset by million in income taxes paid 
net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by million due to increased accounts receivable balances  which resulted substantially from increased billings related to the completion of our plan to commercialize our ppm ratings service in the ppm markets 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a million licensing arrangement entered during the first quarter of  as well as a million asset acquisition during the second quarter of  partially offset by a million decrease in purchases of equity and other investments

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plans  which resulted from an increase in our company stock price during  as well as a million decrease in the net repayment of our outstanding obligations under our credit facility during as compared to these decreases to net cash used in financing activities were substantially offset by a million change related to the recording of a bank overdraft payable in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  liquidity indicators as of december  as of december  change cash and cash equivalents working deficit working capital  excluding deferred revenue total long term debt operating activities

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due to several factors 
net cash used in financing activities decreased significantly due to a million decrease related to no stock repurchase activity during  as compared to million in cash used to repurchase our common stock during also  a decrease in net cash used in financing activity for the year ended december   as compared to  related to million in increased bank overdraft payables  which was recorded as a financing activity in as compared to no bank overdraft activity recorded for these decreases in net cash used in financing activities were largely offset by million in net debt activity  which was comprised of a net pay down of million of outstanding obligations under our credit facility in  as compared to million of net borrowings to assist our cash flow from operations with funding our stock repurchase program during net cash used in financing activities also increased due to a decline in our average stock price during the latter half of  which persisted into at a level that caused a substantial number of our stock options to be out of the money during most of this caused a million decrease in stock option exercises during  as compared to credit facility on december   we entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing to us through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility 
the outstanding debt obligation for our credit facility was reclassified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet in december due to its expected expiration during the year ended december  we expect to renew or replace our credit facility prior to its expiration on december  the credit facility agreement contains an expansion feature for us to increase the total financing available under the credit facility by up to million to an aggregate of million 
such increased financing would be provided by one or more existing credit facility lending institutions  subject to the approval of the lending banks  and or in combination with one or more new lending institutions  subject to the approval of the credit facility s administrative agent 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months as selected by us 
our credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility 
the material debt covenants under our credit facility include both a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness  as defined in our credit facility  divided by a contractually defined adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consolidated ebitda for the trailing month period 
the interest coverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to consolidated ebitda divided by total interest expense 
both ratios are designed as measures of our ability to meet current and future obligations 
the following table presents the actual ratios and their threshold limits as defined by the credit facility as of december  covenant threshold actual maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio as of december   based upon these financial covenants  there was no default or limit on our ability to borrow the unused portion of our credit facility 
our credit facility contains customary events of default  including nonpayment and breach covenants 
in the event of default  repayment of borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated 
our credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby a default on any material indebtedness  as defined in the credit facility  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt and the termination of any unused commitment under the credit facility 
the agreement potentially limits  among other things  our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on our assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of our material domestic subsidiaries  if any  guarantee the commitment 
currently  we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility 
although we do not believe that the terms of our credit facility limit the operation of our business in any material respect  the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
we have been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since the agreement s inception 
as of february   we had million in outstanding debt under the credit facility 
other liquidity matters recruitment of younger demographic groups through cell phone household and targeted in person recruiting initiatives in both the diary and ppm services has increased and will continue to increase our cost of revenue as we strive to continue to improve the quality of our samples 
we believe our cash generated from operations  as well as access to the credit facility  is sufficient to fund such requirements for the next to months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in thousands debt a operating leases b purchase obligations c contributions for retirement plans d unrecognized tax benefits e a see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility amounts in table consist of future payments of million related to outstanding borrowings  and million for interest

c other than for ppm equipment purchases  we generally do not make unconditional  noncancelable purchase commitments 
we enter into purchase orders in the normal course of business  and they generally do not exceed one year terms 
d amount represents an estimate of our cash contribution for for our retirement plans 
future cash contributions will be determined based upon the funded status of the plan 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
e the amount related to unrecognized tax benefits in the table includes million of interest and penalties

off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding as of december   or new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board ie fasb issued accounting standards update no 
revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force ie asu 
this requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
the new guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
the impact of adopting this guidance is not expected to result in a material change to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we hold our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities 
in december  we entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide us up to million of financing through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months 
we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we reported outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of million  which is also equal to the obligation s fair value 
a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have an impact of million on our results of operations over a month period 
a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have no impact on either the carrying amount or the fair value of the credit facility 
foreign currency risk our foreign operations are not significant at this time  and  therefore  our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
if we expand our foreign operations  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes could increase
