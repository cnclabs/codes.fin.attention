business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods  and regulatory environment  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments to be two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is a junior apparel brand for teenage girls who seek trend focused and value competitive clothing  with a target customer age range of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of affordably priced  fashionable and basic apparel and accessories

our online stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience and offer a wide selection of merchandise  with the goal of expanding in store sales 
internet operations for both wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
since fiscal  we have experienced growth in both visitor traffic and our online sales  and we will continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
we do not consider our web based business to be a distinct reportable segment  as the wet seal and arden b reportable segments include  in addition to data from their respective stores  data from their respective internet operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for financial information regarding segment reporting 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of january   we operated arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed six wet seal stores and opened nine and closed six arden b stores 
we currently plan to open approximately to wet seal stores  net of store closings  in fiscal in mall and off mall power center locations 
we also currently intend to continue growing the arden b store base moderately  with a plan of approximately four new stores  net of store closings  in fiscal we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  store leases 
we may  however  accelerate the closure of underperforming stores prior to their lease expirations in cases where we can obtain favorable early lease terminations with the landlords or exercise certain rights contained in the leases 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 
these planned remodels relocations are 
table of contents primarily inclusive of the store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  and our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites  satisfactory terms and satisfactory general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints within the us on the locations of future stores

table of contents strategy as part of a strategic review of business operations  we have identified what we believe are significant opportunities to improve our business trends and drive sales improvement 
the key elements of our opportunities are to continue to manage business conservatively in the near term through the difficult economic environment 
we have taken many actions intended to increase our financial strength through a difficult economic environment over the near term and to position ourselves to capitalize on our company s growth and operating leverage opportunities when such environment improves 
in anticipation of a continuing difficult retail environment  our near term goals include preserving a strong balance sheet  continuing growth of our wet seal division store base and resuming conservative growth of our arden b division store base  ensuring our capital expenditure investments made are accretive or provide efficiencies to the business  maintaining clean inventory levels and reducing costs opportunistically  although we cannot assure we will be successful in achieving our goals 
as part of our cost cutting initiatives  in january  january and january  we eliminated  and positions  respectively  in our corporate offices and distribution center  and two  four and two positions  respectively  in our field operations  across numerous functional areas 
we plan to open to wet seal stores  net of store closings  and four arden b stores  net of store closings  during fiscal additionally  we intend to continue to leverage our recently implemented markdown and size optimization systems  our new distribution center sorter system  and inventory management systems currently being implemented  and plan to continue to closely monitor inventory positions during fiscal while seeking to have the appropriate inventory mix and levels to obtain new trend opportunities 
lastly  we intend to continue to operate with a more cost efficient  streamlined management organization by seeking to maintain our past cost reductions and to make conservative re investments in the business where necessary 
improve merchandise margin 
in our wet seal division  we identified and began acting upon opportunities to improve our planning and allocation function  merchandise mix  and markdown cadence in response to declining merchandise margin performance over the course of fiscal  resulting in merchandise margin improvement during fiscal we also intend to continue to improve upon our markdown cadence  promotional strategies and size offerings by further utilizing our markdown and size optimization systems  continue our focus on key merchandise item categories  further develop branded and private label assortments  and further optimize our accessory offerings in the merchandise mix in order to build upon our fiscal improvement 
in our arden b division  we intend to further improve our inventory management  expand dresses as a percentage of our merchandise mix  and enhance our promotional planning and strategies in order to build upon significant merchandise margin improvement generated in this division during fiscal and fiscal we intend to focus on maintaining a merchandise mix balanced with customer needs and to continue to make improvements to our sourcing processes and expand our sourcing base 
we also intend to improve our price messaging to gain more recognition from our customers for our value proposition 
improve store operations 
our store operations opportunities include improving customer service through new training and development programs  continuing to obtain customer feedback and acting upon it to improve our business  identifying and implementing opportunities to simplify and or eliminate non selling activities  and performing more detailed analysis and monitoring to identify improvements for underperforming stores 
improve real estate 
we will continue to seek to improve our new and remodeled store economics to address pressure from rising occupancy and store construction costs 
we will re evaluate our wet seal store prototype and enhanced fixturing  first implemented in fiscal  to analyze whether we are providing the most attractive store design and shopper friendly environment 
additionally  we expect to continue opening a small number of wet seal stores in regional power centers during fiscal and will assess the opportunity for off mall growth 
we expect to continue to build the pipeline for store growth and growth of our store base  which we estimate will result in fiscal openings of approximately to new wet seal stores  net of store closings  and will continue to grow the arden b store base conservatively  with approximately four new stores  net of store closings  in fiscal additionally  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal and arden b stores during fiscal upon lease renewals 

table of contents improve marketing 
we believe we have an opportunity to improve our marketing and divisional merchandising strategies and are developing specific plans for each division in fiscal we intend to continue emphasizing internet marketing  including social networking  and will continue to focus on direct and grass roots marketing programs and in store visual merchandising 
additionally  we are currently conducting consumer research studies to support and enhance brand marketing programs later in the year and to assess brand positioning opportunities 
improve information systems 
we expect to complete implementation of an updated retail merchandising system in fiscal  which are designed to improve merchandising decision support and increase efficiency of inventory management practices 
additionally  we intend to update short term and long term information systems strategies to provide further efficiencies and cost controls 
improve physical distribution and transport 
we intend to improve business processes to optimize efficiency of our recently implemented automated sorter system in our distribution center  which we expect will lead to increased merchandise processing speed and further cost savings 
realize comparable store sales growth opportunity 
we are focused on regaining sales productivity lost through our comparable stores sales declines experienced in fiscal through  which represented a decline on a cumulative basis  as a result of the challenging economic environment as well as the arden b sales deterioration under its previous merchandising model 
in fiscal  we will seek to achieve comparable store sales improvement through the implementation of strategic initiatives noted above  which  among other things  include continued focus on improving customer service  our store design and fixturing  key merchandise trends  increased efficiencies in our planning and allocation functions from markdown and size optimization systems  improving promotional planning and pricing messaging  ensuring inventory is maintained at sufficient levels to increase business  and implementing an enhanced merchandising system

since fiscal  we have significantly reduced the size and cost of the arden b merchandising organization  refined the product development and sourcing processes to include more partnering with merchandise suppliers  and adjusted our merchandise mix and pricing and promotional strategies 
our new pricing and promotional strategies at arden b included significant reductions in price points across all categories 
as a result  during the last half of fiscal and the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  arden b experienced positive comparable store sales results  and throughout fiscal and fiscal we generated significantly improved merchandise margins versus such results for fiscal and fiscal however  we 
table of contents believe arden b has yet to achieve its full potential with its target young contemporary customers 
we aim to drive further sales and profitability improvement at arden b through our distinctive  quality merchandise  unified apparel and accessory assortments  higher penetration of dresses  our value pricing strategy  new fixturing to increase store capacity  and a continually improving in store customer experience 
expand our online business 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through several initiatives  including expanding our style offerings and significantly growing our customer contact channels through social network investments and more targeted internet marketing programs  including facebook and mobile phone marketing 
we experienced substantial growth in fiscal  with an increase of in internet sales over fiscal we believe our focus on expanding our style offering  introducing new channels to capture customers  continuing to increase internet marketing  maintaining consistent brand messages across both channels  and being more focused with targeted marketing will allow us to continue to grow our online business and also increase traffic to our stores 
we are optimizing inventory allocated to the internet business to better meet the demand of our internet customers and have strengthened our buying and planning staff to meet the anticipated sales growth in this area 
we also plan to continue to grow our internet business through continued improvements to inventory planning  fulfillment  and customer service 
prior to the holiday season  we launched new website platforms for both divisions  which supports advanced merchandising capabilities  personalization based on browsing behavior and past purchase history  and testing tools to measure and determine the most effective content and promotional strategies 
in fiscal wet seal launched industry leading social media features for the website and a cross channel mobile phone application which allow our customers to design  rate  and buy outfits using the majority of wet seal products 
in fiscal  we launched website features that allow for selling to countries outside the us  customers to search for and reserve denim at stores near them  customers to invite friends to shop with them online whereby each person can control and see the same screen  customers to shop online from their mobile devices and other features that continue to enhance our website and customer experience 
in fiscal  we launched additional mobile initiatives in the areas of location based marketing and virtual gift cards 
we also added additional methods to tender payment online 
our social media marketing reach has increased substantially  adding over one million facebook fans in buying our buying teams are responsible for identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each division develop fashion themes and strategies by assessing customer responses to current trends  shopping appropriate domestic and international markets  using fashion services  and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials  and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  we no longer internally design merchandise 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots  and to reduce sourcing lead times 
see also allocation and distribution below 
marketing  advertising  and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
to that end  we have embarked on thorough customer market research intended to keep us in touch with our customers and their needs and direct our marketing efforts to them 
we will also continue our emphasis on visual merchandising and direct and grass roots marketing 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we also offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases  and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program  we send e mails to participants to 
table of contents notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b division also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as that of our wet seal division 
we intend to implement marketing strategies to build upon the past successes of these loyalty programs and to accelerate their growth 
we also plan to more aggressively pursue customer acquisitions and to increase our use of internet marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on in store promotion programs and events and internet marketing  including facebook  for both wet seal and arden b stores 
we expect to increase marketing and advertising spending modestly in fiscal in support of our business strategies 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise primarily from domestic vendors 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail merchandising receipts were directly imported from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are one of the largest customers of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored at the distribution points of our largest vendors and manufacturers  and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california facility 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution of merchandise our merchandising strategies depend on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends largely on our integrated buying  planning  allocation  and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate  and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
we utilize merchandise planning software that assists us in streamlining the planning process 
in fiscal  we implemented size optimization software that we believe has begun to improve our allocation of sizes to better align with each store s needs 
all merchandise is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
in fiscal  we implemented markdown optimization at our wet seal division to improve the speed of selling through slow product and improve merchandise margins 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to select stores for deep discounting and sale  sent to our internet store for selling  sold to an outside clearance company  or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our online business is performed at our foothill ranch  california distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial  and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers  and planners comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core merchandise system is frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
through an installation completed in fiscal  all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by oracle 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price lookups  and 
table of contents centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal intranet that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory  and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
we utilize wide area networking hardware at all stores  which guards against security breaches to our stores point of sale system 
we also recently upgraded our merchandising system  and launched new website platforms for the online businesses 
in fiscal  in order to further improve gross margin through the use of technology  we completed implementation of oracle markdown optimization for our wet seal stores  and we completed the implementation of the sas size optimization system 
in  to maximize the benefits of size optimization  we completed installation of a new distribution center automated sorter system to allow automated picking of customized size ranges for each store 
in addition  a major upgrade to the oracle retail merchandising system began in fiscal and will be completed in early fiscal seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience merchandise cost pressures in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  and increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced 
in addition  the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar is expected to have a further impact on future product costs 
although our initial mark ups have remained fairly stable to date  we experienced some deterioration in mark up rates in fourth quarter merchandise receipts and are experiencing further cost increases for merchandise on order for the first half of fiscal in response to the costs increases  we have evaluated and modestly adjusted our pricing in certain categories and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to help maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we will continue to diligently monitor our costs as well as the competitive pricing environment in order to mitigate potential margin erosion 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
trademarks we own numerous trademarks  several of which are important to our business 
our primary and most significant trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the united states patent and trademark office 
we also have registered  or have applications pending for  a number of other trademarks including  but not limited to  accomplice  b

in general  the registrations for these trademarks and service marks are renewable indefinitely as long as the marks are used as required under applicable regulations 
we are not aware of any significant adverse claims or infringement actions relating to our trademarks or service marks 
competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores  and other apparel retailers  including abercrombie fitch  aeropostale  american 
table of contents eagle  anthropologie  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  charlotte russe  express  forever  gap  guess  h m  jc penney  nordstrom  old navy  pacific sunwear  rue  target  urban outfitters  zara  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls and power centers is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state  or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  we did not make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws affecting our business 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay  or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime  and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for noncompliance with certain of these laws  and future noncompliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
in july  may  and september  we were served with class action complaints alleging violations under certain state of california labor laws 
in november  we reached an agreement to settle the july class action complaint for approximately million  and we have accrued within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet an amount equal to this settlement amount  awaiting final approval 
on september   the superior court granted final approval of the settlement agreement  however  an appeal was subsequently filed on january  on december   the court denied plaintiffs motion for class certification in its entirety on the may class action complaint and denied plaintiffs motion for leave to file an amended complaint 
plaintiffs have appealed both orders but have not yet filed their opening appellate briefs 
we are vigorously defending the may and september complaints and are unable to predict the likely outcomes and whether such outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provisions for loss contingencies for the may and september complaints have been accrued as of january  we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of january   we had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all 
table of contents part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales and other performance targets 
all of our employees are nonunion  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business general economic conditions  perceptions of such conditions by our customers and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending have adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of the continued difficult economic conditions  we may face risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
if continued poor economic conditions in the us and world economic markets become more volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may experience declines in comparable store sales in our wet seal division 
although we had flat comparable store sales in our wet seal division in fiscal  we did experience declines in fiscal and  and we cannot assure that we will improve our comparable store sales in the future 
in order to improve comparable store sales results  we will need to focus on a variety of factors  including fashion trends  our merchandise mix  holiday periods  actions of competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
there can be no guarantee that financial results of our wet seal division will improve and if they do  there can be no guarantee as to the timing  duration or significance of the improvement 
our continued improvements in comparable store sales and improved operating results of our arden b division may not be indicative of our future performance trends  and we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain such improvement in the future 
in fiscal and  we experienced poor financial performance in our arden b division 
however  comparable store sales and operating results of our arden b division have improved as a result of efforts by our senior management team  the closing or rebranding of underperforming stores  and changes to promotional and pricing strategies 
there can be no guarantee that this improvement of our arden b division will continue 
our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management  particularly personnel engaged in merchandising and store operations  and on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key management personnel 
we have had significant changes in management recently and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
effective january   we appointed ms 
susan p 
mcgalla as our new chief executive officer 
as we noted in our announcement of her appointment  ms 
mcgalla will not be based in our executive offices until august additionally  effective march   we appointed mr 
ken seipel as our new president and chief operating officer 
while ms 
mcgalla and mr 
seipel have immediately become involved in the day to day activities of our company  we expect that we will experience a transition period until they are fully integrated organizationally and until ms 
mcgalla is fully integrated geographically 
we cannot provide any assurance that 
table of contents there will not be any disruption that adversely impacts our customer relationships  employee morale and or our business during such transition period 
further  in their roles as our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  ms 
mcgalla and mr 
seipel  respectively  may implement new strategic initiatives for our company 
because these strategic initiatives have not been formulated yet  we cannot predict how these initiatives will impact us 
if they are ineffective  this would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our company s ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially all of our stores are located in regional mall shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact mall traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
accordingly  consumer spending and mall traffic remain depressed due to the continued difficult economic conditions 
as a result  mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties 
the increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations  have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our ability to procure merchandise could be adversely affected by changes in our vendors factoring arrangements 
changes in our vendors factoring arrangements may threaten the factors financial viability and ability to provide factoring services to its customers 
although we do not have a direct relationship with factors  a portion of our vendors who supply our company with merchandise have direct factoring arrangements 
vendors who engage in factoring transactions will typically sell their accounts receivable to a factor at a discount in exchange for cash payments  which can be used to finance the business and operations of the vendors 
if the financial condition of our vendors factors were to deteriorate and certain of our vendors were unable to procure alternative factoring arrangements from competitors of their factor on the same or substantially similar terms  our ability to timely procure merchandise for our stores could be adversely affected 
this could require the devotion of significant time and attention by our management to adequately resolve such matters 
in turn  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal or state income tax purposes is subject to limitation 
we believe that our net operating losses nols are a valuable asset and we intend to take actions to protect the value of our nols 
however  section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in our stockholders ownership interests in our company 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
we incurred ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million nols as of january   we may utilize up to million to offset taxable income in fiscal and future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income 
table of contents could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change also could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation that further suspended use of nols to fiscal as a result  we incurred additional state income taxes in california  which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal through we may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
in the event that state law results in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards  or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax  this could adversely affect our future cash flows 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
furthermore  the continued difficult economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict product demand trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we decrease the price that we charge for our products or offer extensive  continued promotions on our products  we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
the prices that we are able to charge for our products depend on  among other things  the type of product offered  the consumer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors 
to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices  our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to pass through increases in raw material  labor and energy costs to our customers through price increases  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our product costs are rising due to increasing commodity prices  primarily for cotton  as well as due to higher production labor and energy costs 
we may not be able to  or may elect not to  pass these increases on to our customers through price increases  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents fluctuations in our revenues for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
reliance should not be placed on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including abercrombie fitch  aeropostale  american eagle  anthropologie  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  charlotte russe  express  forever  gap  guess  h m  jc penney  nordstrom  old navy  pacific sunwear  rue  target  urban outfitters  zara  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value  offering attractive promotional incentives while maintaining profit margins  and withstanding periodic downturns in the apparel industry 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 

table of contents we expect to open between and wet seal stores  net of store closures  in fiscal at this time  we plan to conservatively grow our arden b store base in fiscal  with approximately four stores  net of store closures 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls  in particular  and within other locations is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  actions of our competitors  particularly increased promotional activity  can negatively impact our business 
in light of the continued difficult economic conditions  pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition  particularly through our promotional programs 
to the extent that our competitors lower prices  through increased promotional activity or otherwise  our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that our competitors increased promotional activity will not negatively impact our business 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases  which could result in higher rental amounts for each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal 
we may not be able to obtain new lease terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to close or relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations or may not be able to find viable locations at all 
our hardware and software systems are vital to the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores  and damage to these systems could harm our business 
we rely on our computer hardware and software systems for the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores 
our information systems provide our management with real time inventory  sales and cost information that is essential to the operation of our business 
due to our number of stores  geographic diversity and other factors  we would be unable to generate this information in a timely and accurate manner in the event our hardware or software systems were unavailable 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of factors  including earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters and power loss  computer systems failure  or security breaches  internet and telecommunications or data network failure 
a significant information systems failure could reduce the quality or quantity of operating data available to our management 
if this information were unavailable for any extended period of time  our management would be unable to efficiently run our business  which would result in a reduction in our net sales 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents covenants contained in agreements governing our senior credit facility restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  under certain circumstances  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility contains covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business under certain circumstances 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict or limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the line of credit 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the majority of our products are manufactured outside the us and is primarily bought by us within the us from domestic importers 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  
table of contents political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the us and foreign jurisdictions  and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations 
we operate online stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores  ii rapid technological change  iii liability for online content  and iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in addition  internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operational results  including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell  ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business in direct competition with us  iii the level of merchandise returns experienced by us  iv governmental regulation  v online security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and or customer information  vi credit card fraud  and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce and the apparel industry 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
risks related to our common stock the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of 
table of contents actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  including comparable store sales  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our charter provisions and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the 
table of contents applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base for that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset the decrease  if any  in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs  and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income we view operating income as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross margins  and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  short term investments  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes and insurance reserves 

table of contents revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are recorded on a net basis 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
online customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for online sales are included in net sales 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  within net sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
historically  a customer generally could return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we modified our sales return policy to allow customers to return merchandise only within days of original purchase 
we also modified our sales return policy such that wet seal retail store merchandise may be returned for store credit only and arden b retail store merchandise may be returned for cash refund or store credit within seven days of the original purchase date  and for store credit only thereafter 
for wet seal and arden b online sales  merchandise may be returned within days for a full refund 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits until we are released from such liability 
our gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
based upon historical redemption trend data  we previously determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits three years after their issuance is remote and adjusted our unearned revenue liability quarterly to record breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits that remained unredeemed three years after their issuance 
our net sales for fiscal included a benefit of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
additionally  based upon an analysis completed by us during the second fiscal quarter of  historical redemption patterns indicated that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits greater than two years after their issuance is remote 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize the change in estimated timing of when breakage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recognized from greater than three years after their issuance dates to greater than two years after their issuance dates 
our net sales in the second quarter of fiscal included a benefit of million due to this change in estimate to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
our net sales for fiscal and fiscal included a benefit of million and million  respectively  to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates  and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program  the fashion insider card  through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is nonrefundable 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 

table of contents we have historically recognized membership fee revenue under the frequent buyer program on a straight line basis over the month membership period 
during november  we changed from in store delivery to e mail delivery of the program s off coupons  which eliminated the customer s ability to use such coupons at the time of initial purchases 
we believe this change affects customer usage patterns 
we also continue to test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could also affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of the program change and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
unredeemed awards and accumulated partial points are accrued as unearned revenue and awards redeemed by the member for merchandise are recorded as an increase to net sales 
we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
short term investments our short term investments consist of interest bearing corporate bonds that are guaranteed by the us government under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  have maturities that are less than one year and are carried at amortized cost plus accrued income 
our short term investments are carried at amortized cost due to our intent to hold to maturity 
short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets were million at january  any unrealized gains or unrealized losses on held to maturity investments are considered temporary and are not recorded unless an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
factors considered that could result in the necessity to impair include intention to sell  more likely than not being required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we have considered all impairment factors and have determined that an other than temporary impairment has not occurred as of january  merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the 
table of contents resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns  including permanent and promotional markdowns  on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns  including markdowns related to slow moving merchandise  as of january   and january   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could result in the necessity to perform an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that indicates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the realization of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  based on discounted cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital 
we have considered all relevant valuation techniques that could be obtained without undue cost and effort and have determined that the discounted cash flow approach continues to provide the most relevant and reliable means by which to determine fair value in this circumstance 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  and  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded noncash charges of million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our 
table of contents stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock option values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
this valuation approach also requires us to estimate a marketability discount in consideration of trading restrictions on performance share grants 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands cost of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses stock based compensation change in estimated forfeiture rate based on historical experience  we modified the estimated annual forfeiture rate used in recognizing stock based compensation expense  from a forfeiture rate to a forfeiture rate in the first quarter of fiscal and  for our executives  from a forfeiture rate to a forfeiture rate in the first quarter of fiscal during these same periods  we also realized benefits from actual forfeiture experience that was higher than previously estimated for unvested stock options and restricted common stock  resulting primarily from executive and other employee departures from our company 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information 
accounting for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as various state jurisdictions within the united states 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and nols 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the 
table of contents jurisdictions from which they arise  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized using all available positive and negative evidence  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider  among other things  three years of cumulative operating income 
in  as a result of historical operating losses and projected future results  we fully reserved against our deferred tax assets 
as of fiscal  we performed an analysis of all available evidence including  but not limited to  generating taxable income for the past four consecutive years  including in which we operated in an extremely challenging retail and economic environment  and concluded that the evidence supported that it is more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets will be realized  and we reversed the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in the amount of million  which was recorded to benefit provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
during our third quarter of fiscal  we determined we previously had interpreted federal tax rules incorrectly pertaining to expiration of charitable contribution carry forwards available to offset future taxable income 
we also identified certain other minor errors in our deferred income taxes 
as a result  we had overstated our net deferred tax assets  benefit for income taxes and net income by approximately million as of the end of fiscal the overstatement had no net impact on the statement of cash flows or total cash flows from operating activities for fiscal we do not believe this amount is material to the fiscal financial statements 
however  we adjusted deferred tax assets and stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of january   respectively  from amounts previously reported  to correct this overstatement 
presentation of our statement of operations  statement of cash flows and statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income for fiscal has been adjusted to reflect the million correction to reduce the benefit for income taxes and net income and to decrease the deferred tax asset and accumulated deficit balances see note summary of significant accounting policies 
the first and second quarterly filings on form q in fiscal will also have the fiscal deferred tax assets and stockholder s equity balances adjusted related to the first two quarters of fiscal in addition  we evaluate our charitable contributions carryforward for likelihood of realizability prior to expiration and provided a reserve against any amounts that are deemed more likely than not to be realized 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a change in tax method  upon filing our federal income tax return  which resulted in the reduction of deferred tax assets related to our charitable contribution carry forwards of million 
this decrease was recorded as a deferred income tax charge and increased our effective income tax rate for the quarter 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was approximately 
this rate was higher than expected due to million in interest charges incurred in the first fiscal quarter upon the conversion of our remaining secured convertible notes the notes and series c convertible preferred stock the preferred stock  which were not tax deductible  and the million non cash deferred income tax charge previously discussed  offset by million of non cash deferred income tax benefit related to stock compensation true ups in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the net impact of these charges was an increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal of approximately 
due to our utilization of federal and state nols during fiscal  we incurred cash income taxes for the fiscal year of approximately of pre tax income  representing the portion of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and state of california regular income taxes that cannot be offset by nols 
the difference between the effective income tax rate and the cash income taxes is recorded as a non cash provision for deferred incomes taxes 

table of contents we believe that our nols are a valuable asset and we intend to protect the value of our nols 
however  section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal nols to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests of our common stock 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on nols occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analyses  we had ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to federal nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of those ownership changes  of our million of remaining federal nols  we may utilize up to million of our federal nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and we may also experience additional ownership changes in the future  which could further limit the amount of federal nols annually available 
as of january   there have been no ownership changes since in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation that further suspended use of nols to fiscal and as a result  we incurred additional state income taxes in california  which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal through the company may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
the calculation of our tax assets involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
at january   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
included in accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as of january   and january   are million and million  respectively  for reported claims and estimated unreported claims under our self insured workers compensation and group health plans 
current trends and outlook we continue to operate in a challenging retail environment driven by several factors  including disruptions in the us housing and financial markets and high unemployment rates across all regions of the us beginning in the fourth calendar quarter of and continuing through the second calendar quarter of  us gross domestic product decreased on a year over year basis 
although us gross domestic product has shown 
table of contents improvement since the third calendar quarter of  the increases have been modest  unemployment rates remain high in the teen segment and throughout the us overall  and we continue to experience a volatile  and generally weak  retail environment 
in addition  we began to experience increased sourcing costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  and increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced 
the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar is expected to have a further impact on future product costs 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of the continued difficult economic conditions  we may face risks that will impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
although we believe we are sufficiently prepared and financially strong enough to endure continued poor economic conditions in the us and world economic markets  if such conditions become more volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our comparable store sales increased for fiscal  driven by a comparable store sales increase in our arden b division and flat comparable store sales in our wet seal division 
the wet seal division s flat comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in average dollar sale per transaction  which was mainly due to an increase in average unit selling price  partially offset by a decrease in transaction volume 
directionally  the shifts in transaction volume and average unit selling price metrics were in line with our expectations and resulted from our planned merchandise content shift at wet seal towards apparel and away from lower priced accessories relative to the prior year 
the arden b division comparable store sales increase was primarily driven by an increase in transaction volume  partially offset by declines in units purchased per customer and its average unit selling price 
lastly  we increased investment in our e commerce inventories  marketing and team infrastructure starting in the third quarter of fiscal and generated online sales growth of over the prior year 
we made progress on several key initiatives during fiscal we achieved merchandise margin improvement versus the prior year in the wet seal division due to the increase in merchandise mix in apparel  especially tops  the reduction of categories that had been underperforming and benefits from our new markdown and size optimization systems 
however  we experienced negative comparable store sales results in our denim business during the year  which we believe was caused mainly by a highly promotional competitive environment in this category 
arden b experienced higher than originally planned promotional and overall markdown levels during fiscal  resulting in a slight decline in merchandise margin performance 
during fiscal  we focused on increasing inventory position within our dress business at arden b and  as a result  increased dress sales 
we believe arden b remains a key dress destination for our customers  and we expect to be well positioned in this category throughout fiscal our strategic priorities are to generate higher positive comparable store sales growth  continue improving upon wet seal merchandise margins  build upon improvements in our arden b business to allow it to reach its full potential  expand our existing retail store base and expand our online businesses 
to drive higher sales productivity in our retail stores  we will continue to review our store layout and design and visual displays with the objective of supporting higher productivity and a strong customer experience 
we have embarked on several initiatives to improve customer service  including new training and development programs and better align merchandise mix with target customer wants 
additionally  we have been attentive to gross margins  including efforts to optimize sourcing of merchandise  enhance our inventory planning and allocation functions and improve supply chain efficiency by better coordination among and within our vendor  internal distribution and store operation organizations 
our operating performance since fiscal has resulted in increased liquidity and improved credit standing with suppliers 
however  we may not generate increases in comparable store sales or may be unsuccessful in 
table of contents executing some or all of our business strategy 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period of time  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and operating cash flow 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed six wet seal stores and opened nine and closed six arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we currently plan to open to wet seal stores in fiscal  net of store closings  with a focus on malls and  to a lesser extent  on off mall power centers to help us gain further understanding of the long term growth potential in that venue 
we also currently intend to continue growing the arden b store base conservatively  with approximately four new stores  net of store closings  planned in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year indicated

this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by reportable segment 
net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales increase 
table of contents net sales for fiscal increased primarily as a result of the following an increase in number of stores open  from stores as of january   to stores as of january   an increase of million in net sales for our internet business compared to the prior year  which is not a factor in calculating our comparable store sales  and an increase of in comparable store sales resulting from a increase in comparable store average dollar sales per transaction  partially offset by a decrease in comparable store average transactions 
comparable store average dollar sales per transaction increased mainly due to a increase in average unit retail prices  partially offset by a decrease in the number of units purchased per customer 
however  these factors were partially offset by the prior year including an increase of million in net sales resulting from a change in estimated breakage for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits remaining outstanding for more than two years from their respective issuance dates 
cost of sales change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales percentage of net sales cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  markdowns  inventory shortages  inventory valuation adjustments  inbound freight  payroll expenses associated with buying  planning and allocation  processing  receiving and other warehouse costs  rent and other occupancy costs  and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our stores and distribution center 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased due primarily to an increase in merchandise margin as a result of higher initial markup rates in both divisions and favorable physical inventory shrink results in the wet seal division  as compared to the prior year  partially offset by an increase in markdown rates due to the highly promotional retail environment 
additionally  cost of sales decreased due to a decrease in buying costs resulting from a reduction in incentive bonuses as a result of declining performance results relative to incentive compensation targets 
cost of sales increased due primarily to the increase in net sales  an increase in distribution costs due to a loss on disposal of our previous distribution center pick system and operational inefficiencies upon automated sorter system start up and an increase in occupancy cost as a result of an increase in number of stores  from stores as of january   to stores as of january  selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general  and administrative expenses percentage of net sales our sg a expenses are comprised of two components 
selling expenses include store and field support costs  including personnel  advertising and merchandise delivery costs as well as internet processing costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses include the cost of corporate functions such as executives  legal  finance and accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate and construction  loss prevention and other centralized services 
selling expenses increased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense was of net sales  or basis points higher than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year increase in selling expenses a million increase in payroll and benefits costs as a result of increased sales volume  a million increase in internet order fulfillment costs due to increased internet sales volume  a million increase in advertising and marketing expenditures due to an increase in in store signage at both divisions  an increase in direct marketing at our wet seal division and an increase in our internet advertising  primarily due to our increased presence on facebook  a million increase in credit card fees due to the prior year including funds received as a result of a visa check master money antitrust litigation settlement and increased sales volume  partially offset by declines in average processing fees as a percent to sales  a million increase in merchandise delivery costs due to increased unit volume  a million increase in store supplies due to increased sales volume  and a million net increase in other selling expenses 
however  the increases in selling expenses were partially offset by the following decrease a million decrease in bags and boxes usage 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  or basis points higher than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year increase in general and administrative expenses a million increase due to the transition payment to our previous chief executive officer  a million increase in corporate wages  a million increase in bonuses due to corporate bonuses based on our financial performance and retention agreements  a million increase in recruiting fees related to our search for a new chief executive officer  a million increase in legal fees associated with various litigation and other corporate legal matters  a million increase in consulting fees due to timing of services performed  compared to the prior year  a million increase in audit fees due to timing of services performed  compared to the prior year  and a million net increase in other general and administrative costs 
however  the increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the following decreases a million decrease in severance as the prior year included a severance charge upon departure of the former chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division  
table of contents a million decrease in general office and supplies  and a million decrease in computer maintenance costs 
asset impairment change from prior fiscal year in millions asset impairment percentage of net sales based on our quarterly assessments of the carrying value of long lived assets  during fiscal and fiscal  we identified certain retail stores with carrying values of their assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  in excess of such stores respective forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we reduced their respective carrying values to their estimated fair market values  resulting in non cash charges of million and million  respectively

the financial performance of our business is susceptible to declines in discretionary consumer spending  availability of consumer credit and low consumer confidence in the united states 
volatile fuel prices and increasing commodity costs may also cause a shift in consumer demand away from the retail clothing products 
table of contents that we offer 
there are no guarantees that government or other initiatives will limit the duration or severity of the current economic challenges or stabilize factors that affect our sales and profitability 
continuing adverse economic trends could affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience cost pressures on the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  and increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced 
in addition  the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar is expected to have a further impact on future product costs 
although our initial mark ups have remained fairly stable to date  we have experienced some deterioration in mark up rates in the fourth quarter of merchandise receipts and are experiencing further cost increases for merchandise on order for the first half of fiscal in response to the costs increases  we have evaluated and modestly adjusted our pricing in certain categories and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to help maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we will continue to diligently monitor our costs as well as the competitive pricing environment in order to mitigate potential margin erosion 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

recently adopted accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
such guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  separate disclosures are required for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  effective january   we adopted the new and updated guidance for disclosures  aside from that deferred to periods after december   and this did not significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe adoption of the remaining disclosure guidance will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk to the extent that we borrow under the facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was 
based upon a sensitivity analysis as of january   if we had average outstanding borrowings of million during fiscal  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a potential increase in interest expense of approximately  as of january   we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars 
we only purchase a modest amount of goods directly from international vendors 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates on short term results would be minimal  as a hypothetical change in the foreign exchange rate of the chinese currency against the us dollar as of january  would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows 
over a longer period  the cumulative year to year impact of such changes  especially the exchange rate between the currency in china and the us dollar  could be significant  albeit indirectly  through increased charges in us dollars from our vendors that source their products internationally
