on august   we changed our ticker symbol to gknt 
on november  we effected a for reverse stock split 
we have adjusted all share and per share amounts in this report to give effect to the reverse stock split 
our business consists of two operating segments e commerce and media 
our e commerce segment sells technology themed retail products for technology enthusiasts through our thinkgeek 
com web site 
we offer a broader range of unique products in a single web property than are available in traditional brick and mortar stores  introduce a range of new products to our audience on a regular basis and develop  manufacture and sell our own invented at thinkgeek custom products 
our media segment provides web properties that serve as platforms for the creation  review and distribution of online peer produced content 
our audience of technology professionals and technology enthusiasts relies on our web properties  sourceforge  slashdot  and freshmeat  to create  improve  compare and distribute open source software and to research  debate and discuss current issues relating to the technology marketplace 
our e commerce business strategy is to increase revenue by expanding the range of new and innovative products we sell  including products developed by us  and by attracting increased traffic to our site 
we attract traffic to our sites using a variety of traditional online and direct retail marketing channels  direct mail and email to our customers and followers 
we also communicate with our customers through social networks such as facebook and twitter 
in august  we changed our third party contract fulfillment and warehouse provider and invested in modern automated distribution equipment 
we currently use the following key metrics to measure our e commerce business year ended five months ended december  july  december  daily unique visitors in thousands orders received in thousands conversion rate average order value daily unique visitors is the aggregate visitors to our e commerce site during the period presented 
this metric includes visitors who visit our e commerce site on more than one day during the period 
average order value is based on orders received 
our media business strategy is targeted to business to business technology companies and their advertising agencies with the goal of increasing revenue per page 
for the past year we have offered limited lead generation programs to customers 
we provide these programs though third parties and the revenue we derive from these programs has not been significant 
during the third quarter of  we hired individuals with the experience and capability of providing a greater variety of lead generation programs directly to our customers 
we believe that customers value lead generation programs and that these programs will have the potential to constitute a growing source of future revenue 
we are also focused on increasing the monetization of our international traffic and currently have two salespeople in london  united kingdom  who are developing and implementing strategies to increase international revenue  and have agreements with representatives in europe  australia and asia to market and sell our advertising products 
we continue to invest in our web properties  primarily sourceforge 
in april  we launched our new download service on sourceforge 
the downloading of open source projects has always been a part of sourceforge 
downloads generate a significant amount of traffic and allow us to target highly relevant advertisements to those visitors who visit sourceforge to download software 
the new download service was intended to be more appealing to a broader group of leaders of free  open source projects 
we also improved our project statistics system  to provide additional information to the engineers who write open source software and use these statistics to develop enhancements to projects 
in july  we launched a series of improvements to our platform for developers of open source projects 
these improvements provide a completely redesigned set of tools  including an issue tracker  wiki  source code management  and discussion system 
this updated platform also offers flexibility by allowing developers to integrate and use third party tools directly on the platform 
we have also enhanced the sourceforge usability and improved site performance 
we currently use the following key metrics which are derived from data provided by google analytics to measure our media business year ended five months ended december  july  december  unique visitors per month in thousands visits per unique visitor per month visits per month in thousands pages per visit page views per month in thousands revenue per thousand pages rpm revenue per user rpu unique visitors per month is the aggregate average unique visitors for all our media sites during the period presented 
this does not consider possible duplicate visitors who may visit more than one of our web sites during the month 
per month amounts are the average calculated as the total amount for the period divided by the months in the period 
revenue per user rpu is an annualized amount based on revenue and unique users during the period presented 
excludes the geek 
com discontinued operations a key element of our growth plans is to increase our user engagement 
our metrics around engagement are an important measure  and we are focused on both growing the number of unique visitors and deepening the average levels of engagement 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  restructuring reserves for excess facilities for non cancelable leases  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
revenue recognition e commerce revenue e commerce revenue is derived from the online sale of consumer goods 
we recognize e commerce revenue from the sale of consumer goods when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in general  we recognize e commerce revenue when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
we generally grant customers a day right to return products and based on historical experience  we have recorded reserve for estimated returns of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
media revenue media revenue is derived primarily from advertising on our various web sites or from lead generation information provided to our customers 
advertisements include various forms of rich media and banner advertising  text links and sponsorships  while lead generation information utilizes advertising and other methods to deliver leads to a customer 
we recognize media advertising revenue as advertisements are displayed over the contractual campaign period  and recognize lead generation revenue as leads are delivered to our customer  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
our obligations may include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions the number of times that an advertisement is viewed by visitors to our web sites 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not delivered in the specified time frame  we do not recognize the corresponding revenue until the guaranteed impressions are delivered 
inventories inventories related to our e commerce segment consist solely of finished goods that are valued at the lower of cost  using the weighted average cost method  or market 
we reduce estimated excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable values 
long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets in measuring whether they are recoverable 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is december impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying net assets  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
the preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units and tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions  which include future values  are often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment  changes in our business and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts 
we utilize third party valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and to perform certain portions of our goodwill impairment analysis 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at grant date fair value and recognize the expense net of estimated forfeitures for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option grant  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting option forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimate stock price volatility based on historical volatility in our stock 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised  or cancelled 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of any loss contingency required is assessed and recorded  if probable  after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter change 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue  represented by selected items from the consolidated statements of operations

international revenue from our e commerce business comprised approximately   and of total e commerce revenue for the year ended december   the year ended december   the five months ended december  and the year ended july   respectively 
the growth in e commerce revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increased consumer awareness of our web site as a result of broader product offerings  an increase in the number of custom developed products such as the electronic rock guitar shirt  iphone case with flip out keyboard and the star trek enterprise pizza cutter 
online marketing  catalog marketing and media coverage of our web site contributed to a larger customer base 
this larger customer base as well as web site enhancements  including improved search capability and customer communication features  drove a increase in the number of unique visitors to our web site 
this increase in unique visitors resulted in a increase in the number of orders received during the year ended december  the average order size decreased by in the fiscal year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the growth in e commerce revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to increased consumer awareness of our web site as a result of broader product offerings  an increased number of custom developed products such as the electronic rock guitar shirt and the tauntaun sleeping bag  online marketing  print catalogs and media coverage of our web site 
this increased awareness of our site attracted a larger customer base  which drove a increase in the number of unique visitors to our web site  resulting in a increase in the number of orders received 
the increase in orders received was partially offset by a decrease in the average order size during the year ended december  as compared to the prior fiscal year ended july  due to the mix of products with lower selling prices 
the growth in e commerce revenue during the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily due to a increase in the number of shipments year over year  offset in part by an decrease in the average value of those shipments 
the increase in the number of shipments was primarily driven by demand for new products  including newly released products such as the electronic drum kit and the personal soundtrack shirt 
the decrease in average shipment value was due to a combination of lower price points of the mix of products purchased  lower shipping revenue per order as customers took advantage of our free shipping promotions and a general decrease in shipping fees charged to customers 
we expect e commerce revenue to continue to grow as we increase the number of orders received by visitors to our site 
media revenue year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to year to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited direct sales ad networks other media revenue media revenue is derived primarily from advertising products delivered on our web properties and more recently from the delivery of leads resulting from lead generation programs 
direct sales revenue is generated from orders received by our united states based sales team  which may also include advertisements to be delivered globally  ad networks revenue represents revenue from our ad network partners  primarily google inc  who sell our inventory globally to customers through automated systems and includes revenue from international resellers who use automated systems  and other represents orders received from our international resellers and to a lesser extent sales of data and referral fees 
direct sales revenue for the year ended december  increased million as compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million in revenue from customers who did not advertise in the year ended december  and million from customers who increased their advertising levels during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   offset in part by a million decrease in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose to advertise at lower levels during the year ended december  the decrease in ad networks revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to decreased revenue from our from really simple syndication rss partner 
other revenue increased by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased revenue from our reseller partners as a result of increased customer account penetration as well as increased rates due to more active management of our resellers 
direct sales revenue for the year ended december  decreased million as compared with the year ended july  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose to advertise at lower levels during the year ended december   offset in part by increases in revenue of million from customers who did not advertise in the year ended july  and million from customers who increased their advertising levels during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended july  the increase in ad networks revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was due to increased revenue from google primarily due to optimization of our web sites to increase yields from google 
since we obtain higher prices for direct sales revenue  we allocate our available ad units first to direct sales campaigns and then to ad networks 
to the extent that direct sales campaigns decline  we would allocate additional ad units to ad networks  which would increase revenue from ad networks 
the decrease in other revenue during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our international resellers 
direct sales revenue for the five months ended december  decreased million as compared with the five months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases of million in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose not to advertise during the five months ended december   offset in part by an increase of million from advertisers who advertised more or who did not participate in campaigns during the five months ended december  the increase in ad networks revenue for the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  was due to increased revenue from google as a result of optimization of our web sites to increase yields from our google programs 
the increase in other for the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by our united kingdom s reseller and to a lesser extent to revenue from other resellers 
we expect our media revenue to increase in the future as we expand our international presence  increase our monetization of international traffic and expand our lead generation and other new programs

our e commerce business has significantly lower gross margins than our media business 
our e commerce revenue increased to of total net revenue for the year ended december  from of total net revenue for the year ended december  and of net revenue for the year ended july  the decrease in gross margin percentage in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to our business unit mix as well as to a decrease in our media gross margin percentage  resulting from the significant increase in media cost of revenue 
gross margin percentage decreased for the five months ended december  as compared with the five months ended december   due to the decrease in our e commerce and media gross margin percentages  which are discussed further in the next section

e commerce gross margin percentage for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  due to higher customer discounts as well as increased inbound shipping costs  fulfillment costs and merchandising and customer support costs 
the higher customer discounts were due to increased availability of promotion codes to repeat customers and catalog recipients 
the increase in e commerce cost of revenue in absolute dollars in year ended december  as compared to year ended december  was primarily due to increased product costs of million  shipping costs of million  fulfillment and packing costs of million  and merchandising and customer support costs of million 
increases in product costs were the result of increased e commerce revenue levels  shipping costs were related to the increased volume of orders shipped as well as inefficiencies in the shipping process following our change of third party contract fulfillment and warehouse provider  and the increase in fulfillment costs were related to increased number of orders processed and start up costs related to the new third party contract fulfillment and warehouse provider 
the increase in merchandising and customer support costs was due primarily to increased personnel required to support our broader product offering and increased volumes as well as costs incurred in moving our inventory to new third party warehouse provider 
e commerce gross margin percentage decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  primarily due to our investment in our merchandising and operations teams 
e commerce cost of revenue in the year ended december  increased as compared to the year ended july  consistent with increased e commerce revenue levels  however  our operating costs increased as we added additional headcount to enhance our merchandising team and to support our expected revenue growth 
the increase in e commerce cost of revenue during the five months ended december   as compared to five months ended december  was primarily due to increased product costs  shipping and fulfillment costs and operating costs 
these increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of orders 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower product gross margins resulting from sales of slower moving inventory at discounted margins and other incentives offered and increased operating expenses  primarily due to additional headcount and related costs to provide customer service and to identify and source new products and to a lesser extent to increases in shipping and fulfillment costs as a percentage of the reduced average order size 
we expect e commerce cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase proportionately with e commerce revenue 
media cost of revenue gross margin year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to year to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited media cost of revenue media gross margin media gross margin headcount media cost of revenue consists of personnel and related overhead  equipment and bandwidth associated with the operation of our data center  personnel costs and related overhead associated with developing the editorial content of our sites and personnel and related overhead and third party costs associated with delivering revenue producing products 
media cost of revenue includes both costs which do not vary directly with revenue fixed costs  such as equipment  personnel and editorial costs  as well as costs which are more directly affected by revenue variable costs  such as bandwidth for delivering content and ad serving costs 
while our fixed costs will generally not vary directly with revenue  they may increase to the extent that we expand or upgrade the equipment necessary to operate our network or if we add additional sites to our network of web sites 
our variable costs generally vary based on the delivery of web pages  content  the number of advertisements delivered and the size of the advertisement 
to the extent that we are able to increase our revenue without increasing our fixed costs  our gross margins will increase  however  to the extent that we purchase equipment in anticipation of increased activity  we may experience decreased gross margins 
the increase in media gross margin percentage for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  was primarily due to increased revenue of million as well as a decrease in cost of revenue of million 
the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in software amortization of million and reduced facilities related costs of million offset in part by an increase in data center co location costs of million 
our software amortization costs decreased due to amortization of our sourceforge 
net marketplace platform ending in june as we deprecated the functionality from sourceforge 
net 
our facilities related costs decreased due to lower average headcount during the year 
our data center costs increased due to additional services requested from the service provider 
the decrease in media gross margin percentage for the year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to a decrease in media revenue of million  offset slightly by lower cost of revenue of million 
the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in co location costs of million  headcount and related costs of million  and ad serving costs of million  offset in part by an increase in depreciation and amortization of equipment and software of million 
our co location costs decreased primarily due to savings resulting from the closure of our data center in santa clara  california  upon completion of our relocation to the new data center near chicago  illinois 
our headcount and related costs decreased primarily due a reduction in our ad operations group in the early part of and our ad serving costs decrease is primarily due to our site redesign  which eliminated a significant number of advertising impressions from our pages 
our depreciation and amortization costs increased due to equipment and related software purchased for our data center and amortization of internally developed software 
the decrease in media gross margin percentages for the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily driven by increases in depreciation and amortization expense of million  personnel related expenses of million and co location expenses of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to depreciation of the equipment we purchased for our data center and amortization of internally developed software 
our personnel expenses increased as we added headcount to develop and serve our premium products  which require more effort to produce 
we expect media cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense related to our data center equipment and consequently  to the extent that revenues remain constant or increase  we expect our media gross margins will increase

the increase in headcount was due to additional personnel in our media sales and e commerce marketing organizations 
the increase in discretionary marketing expenses was primarily due to increased e commerce marketing expenses of million  resulting from a million increase in on line search engine marketing  the printing and mailing of our e commerce catalogs which are now full page catalogs  fees paid to affiliates and consultants  which were offset in part by lower discretionary media marketing expenses of million  primarily due to fewer trade shows attended in the year ended december  the increase in credit card fees was due to an increase in our e commerce revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars spent on sales and marketing in year ended december  as compared to year ended july  was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and credit card fees of million 
the increase in headcount and related expense was due to additional personnel in our e commerce and media marketing organizations  offset in part by headcount reductions in our media sales organization  including severance costs of million related to the reduction of media sales and marketing personnel during the fourth quarter of the increase in discretionary marketing expenses was primarily due to increased e commerce marketing expenses of million  resulting from discretionary online and direct mail marketing  approximately million related to our name branding and the promotion of our geeknet brand and increased discretionary media marketing expenses of million  including events and trade show attendance 
the increase in credit card fees was due to an increase in our e commerce revenue 
the increase in s m expenses in the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and credit card fees of million 
the increase in headcount was primarily due to an increase in sales personnel 
the increase in marketing expenses was due to printing and mailing of our e commerce catalog and other discretionary marketing programs and the increase in credit card fees was due to an increase in our e commerce revenue 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future as we increase our revenue  expand our marketing organization and marketing programs and expand our international media sales force 
we do not expect that sales and marketing expenses will change significantly as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead expenses for software engineers involved in developing our e commerce and media web sites

no internal use software costs were capitalized for the years ended december  and december  and the five month period ended december  as the costs incurred in development have not been significant 
during the year ended july   we capitalized million of software development costs relating to the development of our sourceforge 
net marketplace platform 
r d expense decreased in absolute dollars in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in our media r d expenses  offset in part by an increase in our e commerce r d expenses 
the decrease in media expense was primarily due to a decrease of heads and their related overhead expenses of million as well as a decrease in contractors expenses of million due to expenses incurred during in the redesign of our sourceforge 
net platform  which was released in july the increase in e commerce expense was due to increased personnel who were hired to update and add additional functionality to our thinkgeek 
com web site 
the increase in r d expense in absolute dollars in the year ended december  compared to the year ended july  was due to increases in both our e commerce and media r d expenses 
the increase in media expense was primarily due to increased investment in personnel and related overhead expenses incurred to modernize our web sites and services  and the increase in e commerce expense was due to increased personnel who were hired to update and add additional functionality for our thinkgeek 
com web site 
in we began modernizing our sourceforge 
net and thinkgeek 
com web sites 
r d expense increased by million in absolute dollars in the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december  media accounted for the majority of the increase including million due to increased headcount related costs 
additionally  during the five months ended december   certain development efforts of million qualified for capitalization as development phase costs related to internally developed software 
our e commerce r d expense increased due to increases in headcount to further develop the web sites and their capabilities 
we expect that r d expenses may decline slightly in absolute dollars and may also decline as a percentage of revenue in the future

the increase in severance costs was due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer and severance expense recorded for our corporate team in mountain view  california as a result of the planned relocation of our corporate headquarters to fairfax  virginia

our decrease in personnel related expenses was primarily due to decreases in stock based compensation expense of million and severance costs of million  related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in the prior year 
the decrease in g a expense as a percentage of net revenue was also due to the decrease in g a expenses 
our decrease in legal related expenses was primarily due to the resolution of the okerman legal matter in the prior year 
our decrease in annual meeting expenses and increase in accounting and tax expenses resulted primarily from the change in our fiscal year to december general and administrative expenses did not change significantly during the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  during the five months ended december   increases in recruiting expenses of million were offset by reductions in bad debt expenses of million and facilities related expenses of million 
the increase in recruiting expenses was due to recruiting fees for our new chief executive officer and the decrease in facilities fees is due to expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters incurred during the five months ended december we do not expect g a expenses to change significantly from levels in absolute dollars  and we also expect g a expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts topic intangibles goodwill and other asu 
asu amends the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this standard is effective for we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued a new standard which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of we do not believe that the adoption of this new accounting update will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb provided further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability  an area where practitioners have been seeking further guidance 
it primarily does three things sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
this standard was adopted in the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard which requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this standard is effective for we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued a new standard  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for our calendar year reporting  except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for our calendar year reporting 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and virtually all sales have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments approximate carrying value 
we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities
