critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  business combinations  goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

table of contents historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the licensing of software products  associated software maintenance and support plans  custom software development and consulting services and training 
to a lesser extent our revenue includes non software related hosting services  custom hosting development and consulting services  and technical support and training for hosting services 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software  upgrades  maintenance and support  hosting services  and consulting 
for our software and software related multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine the fair value of each element using vsoe  and allocate the total price among the various elements 
vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements 
absent vsoe  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using besp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vsoe of selling price or tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our fiscal quarter of on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after november  our revenue from sales containing non software related hosting services  custom hosting development and consulting services  and related technical support and training are those impacted 
for multiple element arrangements containing our non software services  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of fair value  tpe or besp  as applicable  and allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method 
this guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and non software elements such as our hosted offerings  we allocate revenue to software or software related elements as a group and any non software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use its besp for that deliverable 
once revenue is allocated to software or software related elements as a group  it follows historic software accounting guidance 
revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
consistent with our methodology under previous accounting guidance  we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 

table of contents in certain instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this may be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products or services within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our offerings contain significant differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to obtain tpe of selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling prices using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to major product groupings  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices  volume discounts where applicable and our price lists 
the most common fact pattern that emerged through analyzing these factors supports a besp closely tied to adobe s list prices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategy 
we regularly review vsoe and have established a review process for tpe and besp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there was no material impact to revenue during the year ended december  resulting from changes in vsoe  tpe or besp  nor do we expect a material impact from such changes in the near term 
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services  custom software development services  and training 
we have established besp for all other offerings  including software products  non software related hosting services  custom hosting development and consulting services  and technical support and training for hosting services 
given the nature of our transactions  which are primarily software and software related  our go to market strategies and our pricing practices  total net revenue as reported during the year ended december  is materially consistent with total net revenue that would have been reported if the transactions entered into or materially modified after november  were subject to previous accounting guidance 
additionally  the new accounting standards for revenue recognition  if applied in the same manner to the year ended november   would not have had a material impact on total net revenues for that fiscal year 
we do expect that this new accounting guidance will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the accounting 
this may lead us to engage in new go to market practices in the future 
in particular  we expect that the new accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services without vsoe into existing offerings and solutions 
as these go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from the results in the current period 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition  but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
we are currently unable to determine the impact that the newly adopted accounting principles could have on our revenue as these go to market strategies evolve 
in addition to multiple element arrangements  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the 
table of contents release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product 
when evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories 
changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
we recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term 
over usage fees  and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data  are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
for our on going traditional employee equity awards  we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assumed equity awards  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed 

table of contents although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed 
the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold 
if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee s exercise behavior  then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company s history 
otherwise  our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold 
zero coupon yields implied by us treasury issues  implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there was no impairment 
we currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including a current examination by the irs for our 
table of contents fiscal and tax returns 
these examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to the calculation of the carrying amount of a reporting unit when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test 
more specifically  this update will require an entity to use an equity premise when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test and if a reporting unit has a zero or negative carrying amount  the entity must assess and consider qualitative factors and whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the new accounting guidance is effective for public entities  for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early application is not permitted 
we will adopt the new disclosures in the first quarter of fiscal  however as we currently do not have any reporting units with a zero or negative carrying amount  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
these disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
the new accounting guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the new disclosures in the second quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations overview of effective in the first quarter of fiscal  to better align our marketing efforts and go to market strategies  we moved management responsibility for the connect solutions product line from our knowledge worker segment to our enterprise segment 
prior year information has been updated to reflect this change 
for fiscal  we reported record revenue with strong financial results including exceeding billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in company history 
our performance was driven by continued adoption of cs  which is our flagship product family that began shipping in the second quarter of fiscal our fiscal performance also benefitted from strength in other key business segments including our knowledge worker  omniture  enterprise and print and publishing segments 
fiscal financial results also benefitted from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal due to our week financial calendar whereby fiscal is a week year compared with fiscal which was a week year 
in our creative solutions segment  broad adoption of cs continued to drive the overall performance of our creative business and contributed to strong revenue growth in fiscal as compared with fiscal since its release  cs revenue has grown approximately when compared to a comparable period of time for cs products 
the successful launch of adobe lightroom version also contributed to our success in our creative business 

table of contents our knowledge worker segment achieved growth in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to continued solid demand for our acrobat product family 
we attribute this performance to strength in enterprise licensing of acrobat across all geographies as well as the improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on acrobat adoption 
we achieved strong growth in fiscal with our enterprise segment  which grew when compared to fiscal we believe our increased investment in this business over the past several years is beginning to result in improved financial performance in the segment 
further  we believe the cem value proposition of our enterprise products is resonating with industry analysts and customers  including adobe connect for efficient web conferencing  and adobe livecycle which makes it easier for people to interact with information from enterprise systems through intuitive user experiences  improve efficiencies through business process automation  and enhance customer service through personalized communications management 
in our omniture business  we maintained strong momentum in fiscal driving this success was increased awareness of our online marketing suite value proposition in the marketplace as well as strong bookings performance 
the number of omniture user transactions in fiscal was trillion  an increase of when compared to fiscal our platform business declined slightly in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to lower revenue from oem relationships

fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from creative solutions increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to strong licensing of cs during fiscal until the release of cs  as well as strong adoption of cs beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
the increase was driven largely by a increase in both creative suites and photoshop point product revenue as compared to the prior year 
the overall number of units licensed increased when compared to fiscal unit average selling prices  excluding large enterprise license agreement ela deals  remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from knowledge worker increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute this success to strength in enterprise licensing of acrobat and improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on acrobat adoption 
a increase in the number of units licensed also contributed to the increase in revenue 
unit average selling prices  excluding large ela deals  have remained relatively stable 
revenue from enterprise increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased adoption of our livecycle and connect products as well as the acquisition of day  which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and contributed million in revenue 
revenue from omniture increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal we acquired omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal and therefore do not have a full fiscal year of revenue for in which to provide a comparison between fiscal years 

table of contents revenue from platform decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower developer tool revenue based on the inclusion of developer tools within some cs suites  offset in part by an increase in distribution revenue from oem relationships with companies such as google  where we offer their technologies as part of the download of flash player  shockwave player and reader and generate revenue through successful installations of these technologies 
revenue from print and publishing increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an improved economic environment in certain markets and geographies  the launch of new products  fees received for engineering services and royalties related to postscript products 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from creative solutions decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to reduced adoption of our cs family of products because of the global recession and generally weak macro economic environment in fiscal the decrease was driven largely by a decline in creative suites related revenue and a decline of in photoshop point product revenue 
also contributing to the decrease was an overall decline in the number of units licensed 
average unit selling prices remained relatively consistent 
revenue in knowledge worker decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal for similar reasons as creative solutions in addition to a decrease in the licensing of our acrobat family of products 
we attribute the decline in revenue to lower volume licensing by our enterprise customers  as well as a decrease in the number of units sold through our shrink wrap distribution channel 
average unit selling prices remained relatively consistent 
revenue from enterprise decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the economic slowdown in fiscal which resulted in reduced spending by our enterprise customers 
we acquired omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as such  there is no prior fiscal period with which to compare omniture fiscal revenue 
revenue from platform decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the impact of the osp which we announced on may   and involves the removal of certain licensing fees of our flash lite client with oems 
revenue in print and publishing decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to reduced demand because of the global macro economic downturn in fiscal geographic information dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal change change americas percentage of total revenue emea percentage of total revenue asia percentage of total revenue total revenue fiscal revenue by geography compared to fiscal revenue by geography overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the launch of cs in the second quarter of fiscal as well as additional revenue from omniture which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal increased revenue in our knowledge worker and enterprise business segments also contributed to the increase as well as an improved economy across all geographies 
included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency 
the us dollar strengthened against both the euro and british pound causing revenue in emea measured in us dollars to decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal revenue in japan measured in us dollars was favorably impacted by approximately million due to the strength of the yen against the us dollar as compared to fiscal the australian dollar also strengthened against the us dollar resulting in a favorable impact to revenue of approximately million during fiscal we had no comparable impact to revenue from the australian dollar during fiscal our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue

table of contents in december  the united states congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through december  as a result  we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december  was million  exclusive of million of interest and penalties 
in october  a us income tax examination covering our fiscal years through was completed 
our accrued tax and interest related to these years was million and was previously reported in long term income taxes 
we paid million in conjunction with the aforementioned resolution 
a net income statement tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million resulted 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that before the end of fiscal  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million

other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal due to changes in our planned cash outlay  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months

stock repurchase program i to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution was not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program was limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and was subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in april from a non expiring share based authority to a time constrained dollar based authority 
as part of this amendment  the board of directors granted authority to repurchase up to billion in common stock through the end of fiscal this amended program did not affect the million structured stock repurchase agreement entered into during march as of december   no prepayments remain under that agreement 
during fiscal  and we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of million  million and million  respectively 
of the million of prepayments during fiscal  million was under the stock repurchase program prior to the program amendment and the remaining million was under the amended billion time constrained dollar based authority 
we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over a specified period of time 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval  and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price per share of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal

this transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and recorded at fair value 
our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio 
our leases for the east and west towers and the almaden tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
our notes do not contain any financial covenants 
we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists 
the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that before the end of fiscal  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
these liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to our consolidated statements of income over the life of the leases 
as of december  and november   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million and million  respectively

table of contents these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director s or officer s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
during fiscal  our limited partnership interest in adobe ventures was dissolved and all remaining assets were distributed to the partners 
as part of this limited partnership interest  we provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures was serving at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acted in good faith on behalf of the partnership

we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for euro  yen  or british pound denominated revenue 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euro  million euro and million euro  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
we began hedging british pound transactions in revenue exposures were million british pounds for fiscal our european operating expenses are primarily in euro and our japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to euro and yen denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
as of december   the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was  million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition  we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of december  and november   this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted 
table of contents revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro  yen  and british pound 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net on our consolidated statements of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur

balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income  net 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program

interest rate risk short term investments and fixed income securities at december   we had debt securities classified as short term investments of  million 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments 
the following table separates these investments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates in millions due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes 

table of contents the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points bps  bps and bps 
the analysis is shown as of december  and november  dollars in millions bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps other market risk privately held long term investments the privately held companies in which we invest  can still be considered in the start up or development stages which are inherently risky 
the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies

short term investments and marketable equity securities we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of december   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at november  the increase was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of december   that are sensitive to changes in the stock market
