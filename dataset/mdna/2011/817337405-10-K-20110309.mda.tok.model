item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a molecular diagnostics and genetics analysis company committed to providing products  services  applications and genetic analysis products that translate the results of genomic science into solutions for biomedical research  translational research  molecular medicine applications  and agricultural  livestock  and other areas of research 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance in speed  accuracy and cost efficiency nucleic acid analysis system that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations 
our system is widely accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system for the fine mapping genotyping market and continues to gain traction for newer applications  such as agricultural biotechnology and clinical research 
our customers include premier clinical research laboratories  bio agriculture  bio technology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  and various government agencies worldwide 
to provide customer support for our expanding user base and in an effort to maximize market penetration  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe and asia  in addition to distribution partners in several major countries throughout the world 
we are researching  developing and pursuing the commercialization of various noninvasive molecular diagnostic tests for prenatal genetic disorders and diseases  women s health related disorders and diseases  ophthalmology  oncology  infectious diseases  and other medical conditions  disorders and diseases 
we have branded our patented technology for prenatal diagnostics under the trademark sequredx 
our efforts in molecular diagnostics are focused on noninvasive diagnostics currently using our proprietary massarray system  however  we may also employ other instrumentation platforms  such mpss with our diagnostic applications as may be more suitable on a case by case basis considering optimum test performance and commercialization factors 
currently  we are primarily focused on developing and commercializing prenatal screening and diagnostic tests using our foundational  patent protected  noninvasive  circulating cell free fetal ccff nucleic acid based assay technology  which we in license from isis innovation limited isis 
this technology uses a simple maternal blood draw meaning the test does not involve tools that break the skin or physically enter the body  as compared to invasive procedures such as amniocentesis  chorionic villus sampling  or surgery for a prenatal diagnosis or risk assessment in order to provide reliable information about the status of the fetus early in pregnancy 
in early  sequenom cmm  our wholly owned clia certified  cap accredited molecular diagnostics laboratory in grand rapids  michigan  launched a noninvasive fetal rhesus d genotyping and fetal xy sex determination as a testing service to physicians using this patented ccff technology 
in september  sequenom cmm launched a noninvasive molecular based cystic fibrosis carrier screening as a testing service to physicians 
in august  we announced that we would no longer offer the fetal xy sex determination test after september  we have made substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure to enhance the capabilities of sequenom cmm to track samples and provide electronic ordering and reporting  and have put in place sample collection and transportation logistics that can be readily scaled 
sequenom cmm is entering into contracts with third party payors to establish pricing for our tests and provide reimbursement 
we also plan to conduct the development  validation  and other activities necessary to file submissions with the fda seeking clearance or approval for selected diagnostic tests 
our research use only massarray system provides reliable results for a wide range of dna rna analysis applications including single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping detection of mutations  analysis of copy number variants and other structural genome variations 
in addition  the system provides quantitative gene expression analysis  quantitative dna methylation analysis  comparative sequence analysis of 
table of contents haploid organisms  snp discovery  and oligonucleotide quality control 
these applications are provided through proprietary research use only application software that operates on the massarray system and through the purchase of consumable chips and reagent sets 
while the massarray system is versatile across many applications  it is a robust and cost effective genotyping solution for fine mapping projects enabled through our iplex multiplexing assay  which permits multiplexed snp analysis using approximately the same amount of reagents and chip surface area as is used for a single locus snp analysis 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis in the molecular medicine market 
epigenetic analysis is an important part of cancer and other research areas 
dna methylation analysis is the most frequently studied epigenetic change  and examines changes in the presence or absence of methyl groups in specific areas of the dna 
we are targeting customers for our genetic analysis technology and products across five segments oncology and translational research  pharmaceutical research  academic biomedical research  agricultural  and clinical research  public health initiatives and biodefense 
we believe the market and opportunities for growth for fine mapping genotyping are increasing as more researchers are completing their larger genomic studies such as whole genome scans 
epigenetic analysis is an emerging market that  along with gene expression analysis  is increasingly being utilized by researchers in conjunction with genotyping to attempt to fully understand genetic cause and effect 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  contract research services  and sequenom cmm testing services 
the impact of our product offerings  contract research services and sequenom cmm testing services on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
sequenom cmm s testing services for cystic fibrosis carrier screening and fetal rhesus d genotyping have only recently been launched and demand for and acceptance of these tests by physicians and their patients is uncertain  and the level of reimbursement applicable to the cystic fibrosis carrier screen and fetal rhesus d genotyping tests is also uncertain 
as a result  expected revenues from sequenom cmm s testing services are uncertain and difficult to predict 
such revenues are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   and we expect to incur further losses for the foreseeable future 
our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and conditions are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
the estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must 
table of contents select an assessment that falls within the range of reasonable estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for consumables  massarray system and other product related sales in accordance with current accounting rules  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with general standard payment terms of days or less are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from genetic services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
diagnostic revenues from sequenom cmm s cystic fibrosis carrier screening and fetal rhesus d genotyping ldts  which were commercially launched as a testing service to physicians in september and february  respectively  have been recognized on a cash basis due to the limited number of contracts or agreements we have with third party payors and our limited collections experience 
we generally bill third party payors upon generation and delivery of a report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and risk of collection with the third party payor 
we usually bill the patient directly for amounts not covered by their insurance carrier in the form of co pays and deductibles  but only after multiple requests for full payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier 
some payors may not cover our tests as ordered by the physician under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows goodwill and impairment of intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 

table of contents we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our goodwill and long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of goodwill and long lived assets was recorded in  or allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balance based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review the historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance against our us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model bsm and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu related to revenue recognition that applies to arrangements with milestones relating to research or development deliverables 
this guidance provides criteria that must be met to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the update is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued an asu related to fair value measurements and disclosures that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
the new and revised disclosures are required to be implemented in interim or annual periods beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level rollforward  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have any effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in  the fasb issued an asu related to revenue recognition that amends the previous guidance on arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
it also clarifies the method to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price 
the update is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  with earlier adoption permitted 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires a quarterly reassessment of the treatment of such entities 
the guidance also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this guidance was effective for us january  and did not have any effect on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consumables revenue consisted of sales of our spectrochip bioarray chips and reagents used with our iplex for genotyping and other assays 
massarray and other product related revenues were derived from sales of massarray systems  maintenance agreements  sales and licensing of our proprietary software and the receipt of license fees from end users 
diagnostic revenues were from the testing services primarily associated with sequenom cmm s cystic fibrosis carrier screening test that was launched in the third quarter of  as well as the fetal rhesus d genotyping test  which was launched in the first quarter of  and consisted of cash collected from tests performed through december  consumable sales increased to million in from million in the increase in compared to was attributable to our larger installed base of massarray compact systems in against  as well as increased consumables orders from our customers in the translational and basic markets against the comparative period 

table of contents massarray and other product related revenue increased to million in from million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in massarray hardware and software revenue to million in from million in  which was attributable to more system placements as compared to the prior year  in addition to a higher average selling price for the year ended december  revenue from other product sales  including massarray maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in  as compared to  was primarily due to more service contracts in effect over our larger installed base against the comparative period 
we recognized contract research services revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million in service revenues for the year ended december  the increase from was attributable to focusing our genetic analysis service business on larger studies and projects with higher revenue and margins 
we expect genetic analysis service revenues to be minimal going forward 
we recognized diagnostic revenue from testing services of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diagnostic revenue has been recognized upon cash collection as payments are received due to the lack of historical sales trends associated with the commercial launch of these tests 
research and other revenue was for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect research revenue to continue to be minimal going forward 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million for the year ended december   respectively  and million and million for the year ended december   respectively 
the following table presents revenue for each reportable segment in thousands 
year ended december  revenues molecular diagnostics genetic analysis our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray system  general economic conditions  ability to meet revenue recognition criteria  the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services  as well as the adoption rates of the cystic fibrosis carrier screening and fetal rhesus d genotyping ldts  and future ldts and diagnostic tests 
cost of consumables and products  services and diagnostic revenues and gross margins cost of consumables and products revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin maintained for product revenues in compared to  primarily due to the mix of products sold  which consisted of increased system placements and higher consumables sales in the current period as compared to massarray systems  which historically sell at lower gross margins  were affected by higher consumables sales  which historically sell at higher average gross margins 

table of contents cost of service revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improved margins in were attributable to our focus on larger studies and projects with higher revenue and margins after our april cost cutting initiative 
gross margins on contract research service revenues are dependent on the particular contract terms of the work undertaken 
cost of diagnostic revenues from testing services are recognized at the completion of testing and were million and million and gross margins were negative for the years ended december  and  respectively  as we built test volumes to cover costs associated with running our diagnostic tests and other capacity related expenses 
gross margin on diagnostic tests are affected by test volumes  the timing of collections and overall reimbursement for the amount paid per test 
our overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount of our gross margins were attributable to the activity described above 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the selling price for massarray systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of product sales and the type of services sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  the percentage of sales made to distributors  as well as the cost of goods sold  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 
our gross margin will also be affected by the adoption rates of the diagnostic tests we commercialize  the testing services sequenom cmm commercializes and the payor and other contracts sequenom cmm may enter into for such tests and the volume of tests sold 
research and development expenses research and development costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  product development costs  and clinical expense related costs 
the increase in research and development expenses of million for compared to primarily resulted from increased headcount and related costs of million associated with increased investment in our diagnostic development and corporate bonus plan and temporary labor  higher clinical costs of million associated with our development programs  an increase of million in collaboration costs associated primarily with a february licensing payment to optherion and a collaboration milestone payment made during the third quarter of  higher share based compensation expense of million  a million increase in restricted stock compensation expense as a result of a performance based grant to all employees in december and a million increase in depreciation associated primarily with a larger capital base associated with sequenom cmm 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in operating supplies and equipment costs due to the commercialization of sequenom cmm s cystic fibrosis carrier screening that was launched as a testing service in september  as well as the fetal rhesus d genotyping test  which was launched as a testing service in the first quarter of the following table presents a reconciliation of research and development expenses for each reportable segment for the year ended december  in thousands

based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into early however  the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk our current investment policy requires us to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities that are represented by issuances from the us government  repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities that have ratings of aaa or are fully guaranteed by the us government 
our investment policy also includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments and the overall amount that may be invested in a single security 
if an investment we hold falls below the minimum quality rating  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to the market risk of the investment 
the appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
based on this determination  as of december  and  all of our investments in marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were reported at fair value 
we measure fair value based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness  credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to operations and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we use the specific identification method of determining the cost basis in computing realized and unrealized gains and losses on the sale of our available for sale securities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of principal invested in ars and had an estimated fair value of and million  respectively 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines in effect when originally purchased  these ars investments had aaa aa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
during the first quarter of  we sold two ars investments with an aggregate principal value of million  but an estimated fair value of million 
these sales resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately million 
for the year ended december   no other than temporary impairment losses were charged to operations and there are no accumulated unrealized losses in other comprehensive income related to our investment in ars 
our remaining ars as of december   was a private placement security with a long term nominal maturity in and with an interest rate that resets through a dutch auction each month and represents an interest in collateralized debt obligations supported by insurance securitizations 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets our remaining ars had experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders and we have been unable to liquidate this security 
since there is a lack of observable market quotes on our remaining marketable security investment in ars  as necessary we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and our overall intent and ability to liquidate our ars 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
based on the factors outlined above  our remaining ars continues to have an estimated fair value of since december  
table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp  the japanese yen yen  the indian rupee inr and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
functional currency of operations as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities aus dollars euro in millions usd a movement of in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to eur exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
