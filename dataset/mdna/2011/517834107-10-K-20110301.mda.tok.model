our operating segments in the us consist of the venetian las vegas  the palazzo and sands bethlehem

development projects we have suspended portions of our development projects to focus our efforts on those projects with the highest expected rates of return on invested capital 
should general economic conditions fail to improve  if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding or applicable government approvals such that completion of our suspended projects is not probable  or should management decide to abandon certain projects  all or a portion of our investment to date on our suspended projects could be lost and would result in an impairment charge 
in addition  we may be subject to penalties under the termination clauses in our construction contracts or termination rights under our management contracts with certain hotel management companies 

table of contents united states we were constructing the las vegas condo tower  which is located on the las vegas strip between the palazzo and the venetian las vegas 
we suspended our construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for las vegas strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions 
we intend to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve and expect that it will take approximately months thereafter to complete construction of the project 
as of december   we have capitalized construction costs of million for this project 
macau we submitted plans to the macau government for our other cotai strip developments  which represent three integrated resort developments  in addition to the venetian macao and four seasons macao  on an area of approximately acres which we refer to as parcels  and  and and 
subject to the approval from the macau government  as discussed further below  the developments are expected to include hotels  exhibition and conference facilities  gaming areas  showrooms  spas  dining  retail and entertainment facilities and other amenities 
we commenced construction or pre construction activities on these developments and plan to operate the related gaming areas under our macau gaming subconcession 
we are staging the construction of the integrated resort on parcels and phases i and ii of the integrated resort are expected to feature approximately  shangri la  traders and sheraton branded hotel rooms  approximately  square feet of gaming space  approximately million square feet of retail  entertainment and dining facilities  exhibition and conference facilities and a multipurpose theater 
phase iii of the project is expected to include a fourth st 
regis branded hotel and mixed use tower 
in connection with entering into the billion vol credit facility to be used together with million of proceeds from the scl offering  we have recommenced construction activities 
we are currently working with the macau government to obtain sufficient construction labor for the project 
until adequate labor quotas are received  the timing of the completion of phases i and ii is currently not determinable  however  we are progressing on alternative scenarios for completion of selected portions of phases i and ii with the construction labor currently onsite 
we intend to commence construction of phase iii of the project as demand and market conditions warrant it 
as of december   we have capitalized construction costs of billion for the entire project including million in outstanding construction payables 
we had commenced pre construction activities on parcels and and  and intend to commence construction after the integrated resort on parcels and is complete  necessary government approvals are obtained including the land concession for parcels and  regional and global economic conditions improve  future demand warrants it and additional financing is obtained 
as of december   we have capitalized construction costs of million and million for parcels and and  respectively 
during december  we received notice from the macau government that our application for a land concession for parcels and was not approved and we applied to the chief executive of macau for a review of the decision 
subsequent to december   we filed an appeal with the court of second instance in macau  which has yet to issue a decision 
should we win our appeal  it is still possible for the chief executive of macau to again deny the land concession based upon public policy considerations 
if we do not obtain the land concession or do not receive full reimbursement of our capitalized investment in this project  we would record a charge for all or some portion of the million in capitalized construction costs  as of december   related to our development on parcels and other when the current economic environment and access to capital improve  we may continue exploring the possibility of developing and operating additional properties  including integrated resorts  in additional asian and us jurisdictions  and in europe

operating revenues at sands macao and sands bethlehem are principally driven by casino customers who visit the properties on a daily basis 
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues casino revenue measurements for the us table games drop drop and slot handle handle are volume measurements 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of drop or handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
table games drop represents the sum of markers issued credit instruments less markers paid at the table  plus cash deposited in the table drop box 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited 
we view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle

casino revenue measurements for macau and singapore macau and singapore table games are segregated into two groups  consistent with the macau and singapore market s convention rolling chip play all vip players and non rolling chip play mostly non vip players 
the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost 
the volume measurement for non rolling chip play is table games drop as previously described 
rolling chip and non rolling chip volume measurements are not comparable as the amounts wagered and lost are substantially higher than the amounts dropped

table of contents hotel revenue measurements hotel occupancy rate  which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  and average daily room rate  which is the average price of occupied rooms per day  are used as performance indicators 
revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy 
because not all available rooms are occupied  average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room 
reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re sold to walk in guests 
these rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk in guest revenue 
in cases where a significant number of rooms are resold  occupancy rates may be in excess of and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate
