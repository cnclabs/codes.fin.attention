non gaap financial measures the company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap with certain non gaap financial measures 
the company does not  and does not suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  us gaap financial information 
these non gaap measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the company s industry 
whenever the company uses such non gaap measures  it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable gaap measure 
with over of sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  management uses currency adjusted growth  and believes it is useful to investors  to judge the company s local currency performance 
organic sales growth data presented herein excludes currency impacts 
the company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates  the result is the defined impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we are able to report currency impacts after the fact  we are unable to estimate changes that may occur in to applicable exchange rates 
any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies 
management also uses free cash flow  a non gaap measure  to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value 
free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the years presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventories on hand and records a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory  inventory not meeting quality standards and inventory subject to expiration 
the provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory is based on current estimates of future product demand  market conditions and related management judgment 
any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the value of inventories 
long lived assets long lived assets  including intangibles with definite lives  are amortized over their expected useful lives 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized against earnings 
goodwill is assessed annually for impairment 
all long lived assets are assessed whenever events and changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair market value 
any significant unanticipated changes in business or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the fair value of these assets and any potential associated impairment 
the company is not at risk of failing the impairment test as of december  pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries to calculate such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect the recognized expense in such future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the company s future expense 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
taxes the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and unanticipated assessments  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company regularly reviews its potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
in management opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax benefits or liabilities attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates would be recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance when it believes that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences

outlook market conditions are not expected to change from the ongoing implementation of programs to enhance and highlight our product capabilities in analytical chemistry  biology and materials science  together with continued emphasis on growth opportunities in fine chemicals  in international markets and in e commerce and are all expected to contribute to mid single digit sales growth in liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of increased or percent in compared to this increase relates primarily to higher net income partially offset by lower cash provided from working capital  particularly inventory as the substantial inventory reductions realized in as a result of a focused effort to reduce lead times and safety stock did not repeat in net cash provided by operating activities increased or percent in compared to this increase relates primarily to cash provided from reductions in inventory of resulting from inventory management programs that adjusted lead times and safety stock to reduce inventory levels 
investing activities cash used for investing activities of in increased from primarily due to increased cash used for acquisitions of businesses 
in  the company used cash of for acquisitions of businesses compared to in no single acquisition during the year was significant to the company s results of operations 
this increase in cash used for acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease  in capital spending  which was to in compared to in as the company substantially completed the expansion of its biotech fermentation facility in israel and the addition of manufacturing capacity for viral products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in the us  and a decrease in purchases of technology which amounted to zero in compared to in cash used for investing activities of in increased from primarily due to increased purchases of technology of which amounted to in compared to in and increased capital spending which amounted to in compared to in the primary driver for the increase in purchases of technology was the investment in certain licenses from sangamo biosciences  inc see liquidity and risk management section capital expenditures increased in compared to as a result of the company s expansion of its biotech fermentation facility in israel and the addition of manufacturing capacity for viral products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in the us for  capital spending is expected to be approximately financing activities cash used in financing activities was in the company issued year fixed rate senior notes  of which  the company received after of expenses

liquidity and risk management liquidity risk refers to the risk that the company might be unable to meet potential cash outflows promptly and cost effectively 
factors that could cause such risk to arise include the disruption to the securities and credit markets  downgrades in the company s credit rating or the unavailability of funds 
in addition to the company s cash flows from operations  the company utilizes commercial paper  its credit facilities and term loans as funding sources 
the company maintains committed bank lines of credit to support its commercial paper borrowings and local bank lines of credit to support its international operations 
downgrades in the company s credit rating or other limitations on the ability to access short term financing  including the ability to refinance short term debt as it becomes due  would increase interest costs and adversely affect profitability 
management does not believe that a significant risk exists of commercial paper or other credit becoming unavailable within the next twelve months 
management believes that the company s financial condition is such that internal and external resources are sufficient and available to satisfy the company s requirements for debt service  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  share repurchases  funding of pension and other post retirement benefit plan obligations  and working capital presently and for the next twelve months 
it is management s view that cash provided by operating activities  along with its available credit facilities is sufficient to fund the operations of the business for the next twelve months

a class action complaint was filed against a subsidiary of the company in the montgomery county  ohio court of common pleas related to a explosion in a column at the company s isotec facility in miamisburg  ohio 
the case was separated into the following four phases phase one existence of liability  phase two quantification of any compensatory damages  phase three existence of any punitive damages and phase four quantification of any punitive damages 
class certification was granted to phases one  three and four  but denied to phase two 
compensatory damages for all plaintiffs must be established before the case can proceed to the punitive damages phases 
the company has accepted responsibility for phase one  existence of liability 
the case is currently in the compensatory damages phase  where  because no class status exists  each plaintiff must individually establish actual damages 
the initial phase two  compensatory damages trial  for plaintiffs was completed on april  with a jury verdict establishing actual damages of approximately two hundred dollars per plaintiff 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal staying further action on the case until the appeal has been resolved 
the ohio court of appeals reversed the jury verdict on compensatory damages 
in a decision dated june   the ohio supreme court reversed the ohio court of appeals and reinstated the trial court jury instructions and thereby the verdict rendered by the jury 
the second phase two compensatory trial in january resulted in a jury verdict of approximately two hundred and sixty dollars for each of the plaintiffs involved in that trial 
a third trial is scheduled for march of the company continues to believe it has substantial legal defenses to the allegations  which it will vigorously assert 
the company believes its reserves and insurance for these and other matters are sufficient to provide for claims outstanding at december  while the outcome of the current claims cannot be predicted with certainty  the possible outcome of the claims is reviewed at least quarterly and reserves adjusted as deemed appropriate based on these reviews 
based on current information available  the company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
future claims related to the use of these categories of products may not be covered in full by the company s insurance program 
at december   there were no other known contingent liabilities that management believes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity and there were no material commitments outside of the normal course of business 
material commitments in the normal course of business include notes payable  long term debt  lease commitments and pension and other post retirement benefit obligations which are disclosed in note  note  note and note  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this report

item a 
quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
inflation management recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the company through higher asset replacement costs and higher material and other operating costs 
the company tries to minimize these effects through focused cost reduction programs and productivity improvements as well as price increases to its customers 
it is management s view that inflation  net of customer price increases  has not had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements during the three years ended december  market risk sensitive instruments and positions the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the company s outstanding debt represents of total capitalization 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt at december  was at a fixed rate 
it is management view that market risk or variable interest rate risk will not significantly impact the company results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rates the functional currency of the company s international subsidiaries is generally the currency in the respective country of residence of the subsidiary 
the translation from the functional currencies to the us dollar for revenues and expenses is based on the average exchange rate during the period 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect the company s revenues  expenses  net income  assets  liabilities and cash flows 
the company transacts business in many parts of the world and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s objective is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the period of time between the original transaction date and its cash settlement 
accordingly  the company uses forward foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of certain receivables and payables denominated in currencies different than its functional currency 
gains and losses on these contracts are calculated based on the difference between the contract rate and the spot rate at the end of each quarter  these gains and losses are typically offset either partially or completely  by the gain or loss associated with the settlement of the underlying receivables and payables 
the company records gains and losses on foreign currency foreward exchange contracts in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the market risk of these foreign currency forward contracts represents the potential loss in fair value of net currency positions at period end due to an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative trading purposes 
the company s policy is to manage the risks associated with existing receivables  payables  and commitments 
the company continues to assess the potential impact of recent trends in the global economic environment on the availability of and its access to these forward currency exchange contracts in the open market  as well as the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations 
given that a majority of the forward exchange contracts are in currencies such as the euro  british pound and swiss franc  management does not believe that a significant risk exists of these forward contracts becoming unavailable in the global marketplace within the next months 
the market risk of the company s forward exchange contracts at december   assuming a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates  would be less than on income before income taxes
