item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the years ended december   and and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview our solutions provide secure information exchange capabilities  for consumers and enterprises  through software licenses  managed and hosted solutions  and professional services 
since our organization in  we have evolved from a company focused primarily on personal file transfer products  sold over the internet  to a solution provider deriving over percent of revenue from sales to small and medium business  or smb  and enterprise customers worldwide 
today  we have thousands of enterprise customers and more than one million individual consumers in over countries 
in addition  our solutions are used by more than  us army users deployed worldwide 
we operate primarily in the managed file transfer  or mft  industry 
directly  and through partner infrastructure  we also operate in the cloud services industry and  in february  announced our entry into the antivirus segment of the endpoint security market with the development of a consumer whitelisting product  appshield 
with the recent solution additions described in this report  we are continuing our evolution from an mft company into adjacent solution spaces applicable to total path security 
the total path security framework addresses data and information security in motion for example  with traditional mft solutions delivered as on premises software or as a cloud service and at rest for example  with endpoint security solutions like appshield 

table of contents key business metrics we have structured our business model to sell an appropriate mix of software licenses for on premises use  maintenance and support m s  cloud based subscription solutions  and professional services 
we review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are revenue growth  sales and sales pipeline growth  recurring revenue growth  and ebitda 
we have developed an internal management dashboard that summarizes certain business metrics and also supports drill down analyses of some sales  marketing  and support activities that also provide indicators of our business performance 
revenue growth we believe annual revenue growth currently is the most significant metric for our business 
we have transitioned from a consumer products company mostly focused on cuteftp to an enterprise solutions provider and have established the foundation for further evolution of our solution portfolio to include cloud based and endpoint security solutions 
while we typically have grown revenue sequentially  quarter over quarter  we view annual revenue growth as the more important metric  especially considering our growth history and ongoing evolution of our solution portfolio 
for example  our business has grown significantly over the past five years as reflected in our inclusion in the deloitte technology fast for the last two years 
however  some of that growth has been the result of non recurring large contracts like those won in and with the us army 
we believe annual core revenue growth  excluding very large  exceptional deals  is a key metric for monitoring our continued success in developing our business in future periods 
given our diverse solution portfolio  and especially with the addition of subscription services  we also review our revenue mix and changes in revenue  across all solutions  on a regular basis to identify key trends and adjust resource allocations 
our recent entry into the cloud services market  with subscription contracts  may change our revenue growth rates in the short term  through mid to late while potentially very beneficial over the long term  subscription sales may slow or even reverse the rate at which software license sales have increased in recent years for solutions like enhanced file transfer server 
this impact may be particularly pronounced during as some software license sales opportunities shift to managed solutions contracts 
however  transitioning toward increased subscription revenue as described in the strategy section of this md a has potential long term benefits that we believe outweigh the possible near term impacts 
sales and sales pipeline growth historically  our sales and revenue have tracked very closely because we primarily were selling software licenses  including consumer products where the m s contracts typically have been adopted at the same rate as for enterprise solutions 
with the addition of subscription services  increased sales of professional services  and the preponderance of our sales associated with enterprise products  we believe sales growth may significantly outpace revenue growth in the near term 
we believe such sales growth  as potentially presaged by a growing sales pipeline  will underpin  sustain  and even accelerate revenue growth in future periods 

table of contents recurring revenue growth we have grown recurring revenue in recent years through an increase in the sales of m s contracts from percent of total revenue in  to percent in  to percent in we believe the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support contracts for our products are sold for fixed periods of time and are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products  then they may not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates both growth in our installed base and satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
we review recurring revenue trends to determine the progress of our m s and cloud solution sales  and customer satisfaction with our ongoing solution development and support activities 
we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in ebitda ebitda or earnings before interest  depreciation  and amortization  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income  however management does use this metric to monitor spending and profitability of the company 
we monitor and review selling  general  and administrative sg a and r d expenses to assess conformance with established budget expectations and identify specific variances 
identifying and  if necessary  addressing variances above budget is important for the very clear purpose of staying within budget ceilings 
however  even variances below budget may indicate imbalances in resource allocations or deviation of operating activities from established expectations 
we have increased sg a expenses in recent years  primarily to enhance our executive team and make other investments necessary to grow our business 
similarly  we have sustained our r d investments to provide a continuing basis for specifying and developing new solutions like our recently announced cloud based offerings and appshield 
we define ebitda as net income  plus income taxes  total other income expense  depreciation and amortization  and non cash charges for asset impairments 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  ebitda should not considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
see our ebitda to net income reconciliations in the table below 
year ended december  december  december  net revenue income loss from operations net income loss plus income taxes plus total other income expense plus depreciation and amortization plus goodwill and intangible asset impairments ebitda in addition  the investment community evaluates our performance on adjusted ebitda  which is also a non gaap financial metric 
the difference between ebitda and adjusted ebitda is the addition of stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda is only disclosed in our press releases for the benefit of our investors 

table of contents solution perspective and trends the following is a summary description of our solutions and associated business trends managed file transfer solutions on premises and cloud based our mft solutions allow customers to move large files even multi terabyte in size and large numbers of files securely 
we also facilitate management  monitoring  and reporting on the file transfers and deliver advanced workflow capabilities to move data and information into and throughout an enterprise 
the cuteftp product is the best known of our file transfer solutions 
cuteftp is a client side software application that permits users to upload and download files  to or from an ftp server or host computer  with support for various file transfer and security protocols such as ftp  ssl  and ssh  plus open pgp encryption 
while cuteftp still has significant brand recognition in the market  it currently accounts for less than percent of our revenue  down from almost percent as recently as we believe subsequent market availability of free ftp utilities plus the emergence of social media and proliferation of means for sharing non sensitive data such as photos and videos  for example  are the proximate cause of the decline in cuteftp revenue 
we derive most  approximately percent  of our revenue from software license sales of our enhanced file transfer server solution suite 
the enhanced file transfer server solution suite provides a common  scalable mft platform that accommodates a broad family of add on modules to provide smb and enterprise customers with increased security  automation  and performance when compared to traditional ftp based and e mail delivery systems 
the add on modules allow customers to select the solution configuration most applicable to their requirements for auditing and reporting  encryption  ad hoc and web based file transfers  operability in or through a dmz network  and integration with back end business processes  including workflow automation capabilities 
we continue to develop the enhanced file transfer solution suite  for example to increase performance  provide additional administration flexibility  and support cross platform implementation with our dmz gateway solution 
revenue for this product line has grown on a sustained basis in recent years from approximately million per year or roughly percent of revenue in to approximately million in during  we announced that we had executed a partner agreement with rackspace hosting that allows us to deliver cloud based mft solutions for the secure exchange of business to business bb data  including large files and sensitive data 
our cloud based solutions allow customers to outsource all our part of their complex and demanding information exchange needs to reduce costs  improve operational efficiencies  track and audit transactions  and provide a greater level of security 
these solutions build on our prior experience with cutesendit  a consumer and smb software as a service solution established in the cloud based solutions also establish an additional delivery method for enhanced file transfer server capabilities  and potentially for other solution capabilities 
through our cloud services  we can offer new and existing customers pay as you go  flexible pricing under one  two  and three year contracts that help them eliminate upfront capital expenditures 
this subscription revenue provides us with a growing revenue stream visible into future periods 
wide area file services and continuous data protection solution we obtained the original technology used in our wide area file services and continuous data protection software through the acquisition of availl  inc in together  wafs and cdp allow users to synchronize files among distributed teams  sending only the changed data  quickly and transparently to end user users  with continuous real time backup 
this approach ensures currency of data at each supported site and also significantly reduces bandwidth usage compared to traditional information sharing process that support collaboration across multiple locations 

table of contents through the timeframe  we devoted considerable attention to improving the performance and overall quality of the wafs solution after the availl acquisition 
sales of the wafs cdp family of solutions have contributed approximately percent of our revenue in recent years 
with the addition of support for the autodesk revit architecture construction and design application in  and ongoing performance improvements through  we believe we have established a basis for sustaining wafs cdp sales at near historical levels 
managed e mail attachment solution our managed e mail attachment solution  mail express  is a client server application that allows users to send and receive e mail attachments  up to gb  with enhanced security and visibility compared to typical e mail solutions 
the mail express application also provides flexible  customer defined administration privileges to allow e mail administrators and even end users to configure specific parameters for handling e mail attachments in accordance with corporate policy 
we initially launched the mail express solution in december and have continued to make enhancements  most recently releasing mail express in august market adoption of mail express has been slower than originally expected  but began to increase in with the new software release 
going forward  we believe we have developed  and are maintaining  a competitive long term solution for securely sharing and managing even very large e mail attachments 
endpoint security solution we will enter the consumer antivirus segment of the endpoint security market in with our appshield solution 
the appshield solution uses application whitelisting technology to block execution of malicious software with much greater effectiveness than traditional antivirus software 
the traditional approach to antivirus software operation is to develop specific signatures for malware  detect the presence of files matching those defined signatures  and then block or quarantine the assessed malware 
application whitelisting inverts the traditional approach by allowing the end user or an administrator to explicitly designate which software applications will be allowed to run 
the resulting whitelist then governs software execution privileges 
if an executable is not on the whitelist  it will not run 
our appshield solution is the result of a joint development agreement established with coretrace corporation in december coretrace develops and markets an enterprise whitelisting software solution  known as bouncer  that has been adopted by numerous businesses and agencies in the commercial and government sectors 
we have designed and are implementing an easy to use interface that integrates with coretrace s enterprise whitelisting technology to deliver this innovative whitelisting solution to the consumer market 
whitelisting currently represents a relatively small share of the served actually contracted  as opposed to potential market for antivirus solutions 
however  there is growing market awareness that traditional antivirus solutions cannot keep pace with the proliferation of malware threats which are increasing significantly in sophistication and exponentially in number 
according to a recent gartner study  traditional software typically is only to percent effective and also can have substantial adverse performance impacts on the host system 
therefore  we believe application whitelisting has the potential to take increasing market share from traditional antivirus software over the next three to five years 
professional services professional services represent an increasing part of our business 
we are bundling packaged or relatively tightly prescribed and custom services with many of our enterprise software sales and also have placed several full time engineers on a mclane advanced technologies mat industry team that won a large us army order during 
table of contents professional services typically have significantly lower margins than product sales or subscription services 
however  we believe professional services allow us to better establish and maintain our solution implementations  while also providing our customers with the training and education services that help them make more complete use of our solution capabilities 
in addition  for large contracts like the engineering services provided to the army  such professional services provide significant past performance that facilitates additional business 
over time  we believe the return on investment from increased professional services outweighs the potential near term impacts on operating margins 
strategy our goal is to build upon our leadership position in the mft market to provide businesses  other organizations  and individual users with the solutions necessary to meet their growing need for secure information exchange within the total path security framework  which considers protection of data in motion and at rest 
from our perspective  more fully addressing this need for secure information exchange requires consideration of capabilities beyond traditional mft  including managed e mail attachment  cloud based  and endpoint security solutions such as whitelisting 
addressable adjacent markets  including those requiring greater bb integration capability  add significantly to the mft market as characterized by industry analysts 
for example  cloud services  endpoint security  and bb solution integration are multi billion dollar markets  as compared to the roughly million mft market 
our strategic focus centers on leveraging our mft solutions and expertise to enter  and establish leadership in  broader information exchange markets while maintaining leadership in the mft industry 
growing recurring revenue continuing to develop and enhancing our software solutions entering and extending our presence in the endpoint security market increasing international and channel sales growing our government sales developing our corporate brand and market recognition enter and establish leadership in broader markets we have been in the leader s quadrant of the gartner magic quadrant for managed file transfer for the past two years 
gartner has stated that the mft market is approximately million to million 
we believe we can best sustain and potentially increase our growth in future years by extending our market reach beyond the traditional mft market 
several opportunities and trends lead us to this conclusion 
first  we believe there are much larger adjacent markets accessible with our current solutions and possible future offerings 
for example  we have entered the cloud services market with our managed information xchange mix and hosted enhanced file transfer server solutions 
industry analysts such as gartner believe the cloud services market was billion in and growing at more than percent per year 
our partner agreement with rackspace and the proven  modular capabilities of our enhanced file transfer server solution suite made this a straightforward market entry from a technical delivery perspective 
as we gain additional sales traction and experience in the cloud services market  and possibly develop additional cloud based solutions  we believe this potentially provides an opportunity broader than the traditional mft market 

table of contents similarly  endpoint security is a multi billion dollar market where we are developing an innovative consumer and smb solution  appshield  which can supplement and over time potentially replace the consumer product revenue we traditionally have derived from our cuteftp product line 
from our initial market entry with appshield  we may develop  partner for  or acquire additional endpoint security features or solutions to solidify and potentially broaden our market reach 
in addition  building on our mft capabilities provides a clear opportunity to increase our average transaction size and repeat business through greater scalability  business integration  and application of professional services to support implementation planning and execution 
our enterprise solutions  such as enhanced file transfer server  have increased considerably in capability over the years and these enhanced capabilities directly contribute to increased revenue derived from enterprise customers 
in particular  the add on modules available for enhanced file transfer server  and increased technical performance for other offerings in our portfolio  provide a strong platform for greater business adoption and integration of our solutions 
we believe continued focus on capabilities necessary for even broader bb applicability is a key strategic opportunity for our future business operations 
we also have considerably increased our professional services capability in recent years 
more customers are contracting for our professional services and seeking repeat consulting engagements to support their business operations 
the persistent business presence allowed by our cloud based subscription services is a strategic development that we believe will reinforce this trend 
with mft capabilities increasingly being integrated into bb gateway  data integration  service oriented architecture  and other technical solutions  the need to keep evolving our solutions and entering adjacent markets also is clear 
we believe the market will continue shifting toward consideration of mft as more of a feature than a solution 
this shift may take many years  but we believe early recognition of the trend and appropriate strategic planning increase our potential for evolving our solutions in front of the ongoing market changes 
grow recurring revenue recurring revenue includes m s contracts and subscriptions for our cloud based managed and hosted solutions 
in the broadest sense  delivery of labor hours on long duration contracts also fits within this strategy because such contracted sales provide a book of sold business that will be recognized into revenue in future periods  with some revenue from these labor contracts potentially visible even two or three years in the future 
we believe that execution on this strategy element potentially could provide greater predictability of revenue in future periods and a stronger hedge against future business or broader economic downturns 
our recurring revenue  primarily in the form of m s contracts  grew from percent in to percent in we intend to focus on delivering continued growth in deferred revenue  while assessing market traction for the full range of our solutions on an ongoing basis 
from this perspective  deferred revenue may continue to grow in absolute terms  and as a percentage of total revenue  for some period of time 
however  the long term proportion of deferred revenue is dependent on the future growth rates of all of our solutions 
as discussed under key business metrics in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  subscription sales may change the trajectory of our prior revenue growth 
we believe that  due to compounding effects and after a transition period  subscription revenue can grow more quickly than software license revenue  while supporting increased operating margins after the transition 
continue to enhance and develop our solutions we have allocated significant resources to enhancing and developing our solutions in recent years 
this strategic focus has delivered substantially more capable releases of our wafs  mail express  and enhanced file transfer solutions  plus our cloud based offerings and professional services 
we intend to maintain our focus on developing our solution portfolio and  as appropriate  enhancing our existing solutions 

table of contents our solution portfolio may evolve over time  for example  through development of new offerings in adjacent markets or through acquisition 
during  and into early  we announced development of several new solutions  including our mix  hosted enhanced file transfer server  and appshield 
we maintain an active r d program and work closely with partners and others within industry  to identify new solution opportunities 
as an example  we began our original oem partnership with network automation in  embedding network automation s automate product as an advanced workflow engine awe module to our enhanced file transfer server solution 
during  we expanded our partner agreement to become a worldwide reseller of network automation s software solutions  automate and automate business process automation server 
we also have acquired solutions through merger and acquisition activities in the past  and may do so in the future as well 
as we evolve our solution portfolio  we intend to maintain an appropriate balance between legacy and new solutions  including making choices about transitioning  sustaining  or retiring solutions as necessary to best operate under prevailing business conditions 
transitioning or sustaining solutions may involve consolidating capabilities within our solution portfolio  releasing upgrades in response to market or customer needs  or making bug fixes in accordance with our communicated end of life eol policy 
we also will phase out solutions periodically in accordance with the eol policy 
enter and extend our presence in the endpoint security market we are entering the antivirus segment of the endpoint security market with appshield 
the appshield solution provides an opportunity for us to increase sales of our consumer products  which have declined in recent years 
the endpoint security market also is attractive because consumer sales typically are relatively low touch and accomplished largely through our online cart  over the internet 
from this initial market entry with appshield we intend to explore  and potentially develop or acquire  other endpoint security solutions 
these additional solutions may be complementary to appshield or to our other solutions 
like appshield  the other solutions also may appeal to smb or even enterprise customers 
increase international and channel sales we have added several channel partners in recent years and also organized our sales force and associated sales processes  to more effectively support our partner network worldwide 
channel partners resell  distribute  or integrate our solutions 
channel partners announced since the beginning of include carahsoft corporation  lifeboat distribution  mat  and multiple system integration companies with whom we have registered as a small business 
we also have added other channel partners worldwide in recent years 
these channel partners provide us with additional opportunities to penetrate deeper into existing markets and enter new sales territories 
channel sales also can help us establish a lower touch delivery model through which we train and provision the partners to sell and distribute our solutions 
achieving additional traction in new sales territories potentially can increase our sales in future years  considering we currently derive approximately percent of our sales from just the united states  united kingdom  canada  and australia 
grow government sales we are leveraging our prior army contracts  and other government orders  to gain the insights  establish the past performance  and sustain the credentials necessary to pursue additional government business directly and through channel partners 
we are a subcontractor on the mclane advanced technologies industry team that won a million contract with the us army for the standard army maintenance system enhanced and are supporting that contract with several engineers on a full time basis 
we are also working independently as well as in conjunction with mat  carahsoft  and other partners to pursue additional government business 

table of contents government sales  particularly large contracts from the us army  have had a significant positive impact on our growth and market image since  however  these large contracts also cause significant swings in our financial results 
we are focused on more deliberate growth in government sales  including software and associated services  potentially augmented by occasional large product orders 
our engineering services activities in support of the sams e contract are part of this long term focus 
we may obtain  sustain  or update government certifications as necessary to compete in this sector 
for example  we have received federal information processing standards fips validation of the globalscape cryptographic module embedded in enhanced file transfer server 
in addition  enhanced file transfer server version and the latest version of cuteftp pro received the certificate of networthiness from the us army network technology command during our receipt of this certificate enables army installations worldwide to install and operate these server and client based secure information exchange solutions 
additional government business opportunities also may arise as a result of the wikileaks disclosures during the resulting bans on removable media within the government raise the profile of solutions like ours for securely moving large files  or large numbers of file 
develop our corporate brand globalscape traditionally has been better known for cuteftp than as a corporate brand 
since the late timeframe  we have made a concerted effort to elevate our corporate profile 
we retained new venture communications as our marketing communications firm and the summit ir group for investor relations support in we also established a strong  but informal  relationship with america s growth capital  an investment bank focused on emerging growth markets 
through our efforts in this area  we have participated in numerous analyst briefings and non deal investor conferences that have increased our recognition within the investor and analyst communities 
we also have obtained increasing national media coverage 
in addition  we have revised our website  logos  and other areas reflecting our corporate brand 
through these activities  we have established a much more consistent  recognizable brand that may better support future growth and market visibility 
we also believe we have enhanced our brand through additional national and regional attention resulting from corporate awards received during we were named a best places to work in it  a ranking determined by computerworld of the top work environments for technology professionals 
organizations that are selected are those that challenge their it staff with exciting projects  offer them access to  and training with  today s hottest technology  and provide great benefits and compensation 
we also were ranked in among the top workplaces in san antonio by the san antonio express news and named one of the best places to work for by the san antonio business journal 
this award honors companies with the best workplaces in the greater san antonio area 
in addition to these corporate awards  we were named to deloitte s technology fast for the second year in a row  a ranking that recognizes the fastest growing technology  media  telecommunications  life sciences and clean technology companies in north america on the basis of five year revenue growth 
we believe our corporate  financial  and technical awards in aggregate increase our market visibility and provide a stronger basis for continued development of the globalscape brand 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a strong working capital position resulting from net profits from operations over of the last quarters 
at december   our net working capital position was approximately million 
we 
table of contents had cash available of million and we continue to generate cash from operating activities 
we rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and believe that these will be our principal sources of operating capital in our capital requirements principally relate to our need to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  which primarily consist of research and development expenses and expenses for people and the elements that support their work 
by comparison  we do not spend large sums on capital equipment 
over the past three years  we spent  in   in and million in for equipment 
capital expenditures were higher in primarily as a result of the move to new office space in san antonio 
because our principal sources of capital are cash on hand and cash flow from operations  to the extent that sales decline  our cash flow from operations will also decline 
if sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress  management could substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and or reduce or substantially eliminate research and development expenditures 
we may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities  to the extent available 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was largely due to a non recurring million order from the us army received in april significant non cash add backs in include the goodwill and long lived asset impairment  offset by a large non cash decrease in deferred taxes 
the remainder of the change in cash provided by operating activities was due to increases in deferred taxes  accrued expenses and a receivable from coretrace 
the coretrace receivable consists of a working capital loan of  to coretrace plus related interest in net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the cash provided by investing activities for was from short term investment redemptions  net of property and equipment purchases 
cash used in investing activities in was for an investment of million in coretrace  a million net investment in short term certificates of deposit  and  which was used for additional furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements as renovations were made to our office 
in  cash used in investing activities was used for additional furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements as we moved into a new office 
our financing activities over the past three years have primarily related to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
during  there was an increase in proceeds the company received from the exercise of stock options as well as tax benefits related to stock option expense 
in  we used our own cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the amount of  at december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases as well as royalty agreements with third parties  federal income tax and trade accounts payable 
the commitments related to royalty agreements are contingent on sales volumes 
we plan to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods and may also use our cash to acquire or license technology  intellectual property  products or businesses related to our current business strategy 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   consisting of future minimum payments under operating leases payments due by fiscal year and thereafter total contractual obligations building lease equipment leases new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance regarding the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
this guidance requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue recognition 
this guidance also provides information on how to allocate consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have evaluated the effect of the adoption of this guidance as of december   and believe that it will have no material effect on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended its guidance regarding revenue recognition on multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
this amendment also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the guidance also requires the best estimate of selling price be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
finally  this guidance significantly expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have evaluated the effect of the adoption of this guidance as of december   and believe that it will have no material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for research and development costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 

table of contents revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable written agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when a compact disc or other medium containing the licensed software is provided to a common carrier or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the refund or adjustment right lapses or the return is estimable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as amounts become due and payable or as cash is collected 
we grant a limited right of return to our customers 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection 
the company also enters into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers 
the license agreements generally include product maintenance and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
in any given period if the amount of revenue that is deferred  which is equal to the total of that period s maintenance and support sales  is greater than the amount recognized  then revenue will decrease and vice versa 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product support  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately million as of december   of which approximately million was classified as other long term liabilities in the balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
we recognize hosting revenue  including setup fees on a monthly basis  over the contractual term of the customer contract 
we believe customers generally will continue to utilize our services beyond the initial contract term which typically ranges from one to three years 
as a result  setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of a customer relationship 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and either deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
while the above noted accounting standards govern the basis for revenue recognition  judgment and the use of estimates are required in connection with the allocation of revenue between software license revenue and 
table of contents maintenance and support revenue  as well as the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
a two step impairment test is to be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the equity assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  growth rates and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in  during the performance of our annual impairment test and in conjunction with our budgeting process a review of the projected future sales of our wafs cdp products showed a significant decrease in expected future revenues 
this decrease was a significant contributing factor in the goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
in december  the company performed its annual impairment analysis  for the wafs reporting unit 
for this analysis  we estimated the fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment were the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  working capital requirements  and terminal value assumptions 
this analysis required the input of several critical assumptions including future growth rates  cash flow projections  wacc  rate of return  and terminal value assumptions 
in a significant change was made in the terminal value assumption 
in prior years  it was assumed that the reporting unit would have an end of life in approximately five years 
in the company re assessed this assumption and determined that the reporting unit would continue in perpetuity 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital 
the results of the analysis show a carrying value of  as of december   compared to a fair value of  the fair value is more than double the carrying value and thus no impairment was recorded as of december  intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
the availl purchase largely gained us rights to software  the value of the software on our books and goodwill are linked 
therefore the same 
table of contents analysis of future sales that led us to determine there was a goodwill impairment also led to an impairment of the acquired asset 
during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million primarily for the write down of identified intangible assets related to the availl acquisition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognizing expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends and measuring volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes we recognize taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events in our financial statements 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  including uncertain tax positions and the realizability of deferred tax assets  which is dependent on the timing of the underlying deductions and the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

table of contents revenue 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of our software licenses and from maintenance and support and professional services 
we also recognize revenue from delivery of professional services and from subscription based offerings 
software license revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our enterprise solutions  such as enhanced file transfer server and wafs  and is typically recognized upon shipment 
maintenance and support revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year  but can be up to three years 
professional services revenue includes a variety of customization  implementation  and integration services  as well as delivery of education and training associated with our solutions  all of which are recognized as the services are performed 
in addition  during we added subscription revenues related to the sales of our managed solutions 
subscription revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the services are billed over the contract period  which ranges from one to three years 
our professional services and subscription services did not contribute materially to our revenue  although professional services revenue grew substantially as compared to prior years 
revenues increased from million in to million in the increase of approximately million or in revenues was largely due to an increase in average sales price  an increase in maintenance and support sales  and increased contribution from professional services 
the following table reflects revenue by product including the related maintenance and support for each product in thousands revenue for the year ended december  product eft server enterprise eft server cuteftp professional cuteftp home wide area file services cdp other total revenues maintenance and support net of deferred revenues total revenue from our eft server and eft server enterprise solutions increased by  to million in from million in this increase in revenue was largely due to an increase in average sales price and an increase in maintenance and support renewal sales for these solutions 
we also believe increasing numbers of customers are upgrading from eft server to eft server enterprise  in line with the solution suite approach announced with the release of eft server in these upgrades and new sales of eft server enterprise increased sales of that solution by  from approximately million in to almost million in  more than offsetting the decline in revenue from the more entry level eft server 
we believe the decline in revenue for eft server also reflects a sales promotion we ran in the second half of during which we delivered eft server for free  while upselling add on modules and m s contracts 
increased discussion of add on modules with sales prospects and prior customers also may have contributed to the increased sales of eft server enterprise which supports a range of add on modules in addition to those available for use with the base enterprise file transfer server 
the year to year increase in total eft server sales including eft server enterprise is noteworthy because it comes despite the inclusion of a large  non recurring us army order for eft server in in total  our eft server and eft server enterprise products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately of total revenues in and in this decline continues the general reduction in cuteftp product revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  experienced since the 
table of contents consumer ftp product market has substantial low cost  and even free  solutions that have put increasing pressure on cuteftp product revenues 
additional pressure on this product line comes from social media companies and services that allow consumers to share images and video 
our reliance on the current cuteftp products will continue to decline as we emphasize sales of our enterprise products and potentially achieve greater penetration into adjacent markets such as cloud services and endpoint security
