item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to stockholders that appear elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
we design  develop and manufacture advanced high performance rf solutions with gaas  gan  saw and baw technologies for customers worldwide 
we serve growing markets and a diverse customer base of manufacturers building connected mobile devices  g g cellular base stations  triple play cable solutions  fiber optic networks  wlan  wimax lte  gps and defense and aerospace applications 
strategy and industry considerations we provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions for applications in the mobile device  networks  and defense and aerospace markets 
our mission is connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and defense markets 
in the mobile device market  we provide high performance devices such as integrated modules  duplexers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and rf filters 
in the networks market  we are a supplier of an extensive portfolio of gaas mmics and transistors and saw and baw filter components 
we provide the defense and aerospace market with phased array antenna and communications components 
we have been a leader in gan development since wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of high demand factories run at higher utilization rates resulting in improved financial performance 
strong growth in demand is driving increased capital expenditures for added capacity in our factories 
we experienced overall revenue growth for compared to  with growth in all three of our markets 
mobile devices comprise the largest of our three major markets 
revenues for increased compared to growth in this market was driven primarily by the strong demand for mobile data connectivity and the transition of the rf market from discrete to integrated solutions 
as a result of the demand for smartphones and the expansion of rf content required for wcdma technology  revenue from wcdma mobile devices increased in compared to in  triquint transferred the wireless client engineering and marketing teams from the networks to mobile devices business unit 
this change recognizes that the demand for wireless connectivity has moved beyond traditional mobile devices to a variety of other applications  including data cards  netbooks  and various personal media devices 
for comparability purposes  market revenue for mobile devices and networks was reclassified in prior years 
networks revenue increased in compared to as a result of a broad recovery in this market 
our networks products support the transfer of data at high rates across wireless or wired networks  specifically for transport  radio access  and emerging market applications 
transport includes submarkets such as cable television  microwave radio  enterprise and consumer satellite ground terminals  and optical communications 
radio access is composed primarily of base station infrastructure and repeaters 
we also support emerging wireless markets such as wireless hotspots  automotive  ami  and rfid 
our multi market standard products are also in the emerging markets category 
our defense and aerospace revenues increased in compared to we are recognized for technology leadership in compound semiconductors  and baw and saw filters 
we are successfully partnering with industry leaders creating next generation solutions 
in the short term we are benefiting from positive cycles in airborne radar programs such as the lightning jsf and other aesa  and in the longer term we are shifting our strategy to emulate our successful module efforts in the commercial market 
this involves transitioning from a technology provider to a solutions supplier by creating rf solutions in high performance  cost effective packages and modules 
for example  module integration can increase the functionality and reduce the space requirements in a high density phased array antenna 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  
table of contents different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  which affects gross margin  accounting for income taxes  which affects our tax provision  and stock based compensation  which affects cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  and our reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and foundry services in the mobile devices  networks  and defense and aerospace markets 
we also receive revenues from non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenues from the sale of products are recognized when title passes to the buyer 
our product sales include warranty provisions that provide that the products will be free of faulty workmanship or defective materials and that the products will conform to our published specifications or other specifications mutually agreed upon with the customer 
our historical warranty claims experience  and our warranty liability  have not been material 
revenues from our distributors are recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
sales to our distributors were between and of our total revenues for  and our distributor agreements provide selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve when offered 
further  the distributor s payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear the risks of ownership  have economic substance and we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and we reserve for such instances 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
the revenue reserves have remained consistent as a percentage of revenue and we have visibility into the distributors inventory levels and qualifying sales  and are  therefore  able to reasonably estimate the revenue reserves 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenues when customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  which is the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use standard cost methodology to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze last usage date as well as forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand  and reserve for the excess and identify and record other specific reserves 
income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income 
table of contents in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we use the with and without approach  disregarding indirect tax impacts  for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share based deductions are recognized 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards arising from both operations and excess stock option deductions reduce federal and state taxes payable such that we do not have significant income taxes payable at december  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized in future tax returns 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our net deferred tax assets 
during the first half of  we experienced substantial revenue growth and demand for our products 
however  raw material and capacity constraints experienced during this period resulted in uncertainty about the strength  timing and predictability of improved performance 
during the third quarter of  wafer supply  manufacturing capacity and yields improved  driving increased profitability and the expectation that similar results could be sustained 
due to strong results for and increased confidence that we will continue to generate taxable income into the foreseeable future  our assessment regarding the potential to realize our deferred tax assets changed 
this assessment required us to exercise significant judgment and make estimates about our ability to generate revenues  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
the result was the release of a majority of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of us deferred tax assets  as we do not believe it is more likely than not that these will be realized in future periods 
specifically  sources of capital gain taxable income were not identified to utilize capital loss carryforwards and the statute of limitations may expire before certain state net operating loss carryforwards are utilized 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in all of our operational jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon tax audit  administrative appeals or final tax court determination 
the liabilities are reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
as of december   we were not under audit by us income tax authorities 
we concluded federal income tax audits for our us consolidated tax group on earlier years  most recently for the years and a german tax audit of our subsidiary  triquint semiconductor gmbh  was completed during for the fiscal years through  with no adjustments 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
we believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
our income tax benefit expense as of and for each of the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  income tax benefit expense the tax benefit resulted primarily from the release of the valuation allowance and the release of certain previously recorded tax liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the valuation allowance had previously been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
offsetting this benefit was the us federal tax expense for alternative minimum tax recorded under the with and without approach for excess share based compensation deductions 
the and income tax provisions primarily consisted of domestic and foreign tax liabilities in the us and costa rica 
no provision has been made for the us  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are intended to be  permanently reinvested outside of the us it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested outside of the us 
in the event the foreign subsidiaries repatriate these earnings  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes 
our and net unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively  including 
table of contents accumulated interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
to the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities of any underpayment of income taxes  such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expenses on the statement of operations 
realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate 
our unrecognized tax benefits anticipated to be released due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on or before december  total million 
no other changes to the unrecognized tax benefits are anticipated within the next twelve months 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for  and  included in our consolidated statements of operations in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model which requires a number of assumptions  including the expected lives of stock options  the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the expected life of the award 
we determine our risk free rate assumption based upon the us treasury yield for obligations with contractual lives similar to the expected lives of our option grants and espp subscription periods 
the expected life represents the weighted average period the options are expected to remain outstanding  based upon historical experience 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and anticipated dividend distributions 
the expected volatility is based upon a blend of our historical volatility of our stock price and our exchange traded options for the expected life of the award 
forfeitures are estimated based upon historical and anticipated future experience for the expected life of the award 
acquisition of triaccess technologies  inc  on september   we completed the acquisition of triaccess technologies  inc ta  a provider of cable tv and fith and rf specific integrated circuits for the amplification of multimedia content  by purchasing of ta s outstanding shares 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing  net of cash acquired estimated earnout payment liability total the earnout payment liability has been estimated at its fair value and represents an obligation to pay up to million to the former ta shareholders  over three years  upon ta product sales meeting certain revenue thresholds 
no earnout was paid in because the sales of ta products did not meet the revenue thresholds 
we have estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  using a cash flow based approach discounted with a market discount rate 
in process research and development is considered an indefinite lived asset and will be amortized or impaired upon completion or abandonment of specific projects  estimated to be complete in the next years 
all other intangible assets will be amortized over a period of three to five years 

table of contents goodwill is calculated as the purchase price in excess of the fair values of ta s assets and liabilities and represents our opportunity to expand our product line into video delivery  a high margin high growth market we currently under serve 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
the purchase price was allocated to ta s assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows in millions tangible assets acquired  net of cash acquired developed technology in process research and development goodwill total the results of operations for the ta business are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period from september  to december  pro forma results of operations have not been presented for this acquisition because its effect was not material to us 
acquisition of wj communications  inc wj on may   we completed the acquisition of wj  a rf semiconductor company that provides rf product solutions worldwide to communications equipment companies 
we paid million in cash on the closing date and million of direct acquisition costs for of the shares of wj 
the results of operations for the wj business are included in our consolidated statements of operations from may  forward 
the following unaudited pro forma consolidated information gives effect to the acquisition of wj as if it had occurred on january  after giving effect to certain adjustments  including the amortization of intangible assets  interest income  and tax adjustments  and assumes the purchase price has been allocated to assets and purchased liabilities assumed based on values at the date of purchase 
results may not be indicative of future operating results 
proforma results of operations unaudited year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue net loss basic loss per share diluted loss per share we committed to a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities in san jose  california and china and to reduce certain redundant positions in the wj operations as a result of the acquisition 
the consolidation of the facilities and the reduction of personnel were substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of the plan to consolidate facilities includes partial abandonment of the san jose facility and full abandonment of the china leases 
the china lease expired in and the san jose lease expires in march payments related to this restructuring are expected to be complete by the end of during we revised our estimate of future payments relating to the san jose lease  and accordingly  recorded a reduction to the future liability of million

refer to item for more details 
settlement of lawsuit on february   a purported derivative action was filed in the united states district court for the district of oregon  allegedly on behalf of triquint  against certain of triquint officers and directors 
the case was settled on september  and we paid the plaintiffs million 
we recorded no lawsuit settlements in other income expense  net other net income in increased million from the increase was primarily a result of the million recovered from a previously impaired investment as the result of the investment being purchased by another company 
the increase was offset by a million decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and by an increase of million in foreign exchange loss 
income tax expense in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million in the benefit was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance release which was recorded against the deferred tax assets and the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations

litigation expense litigation expense increased million  or  from the increase is primarily a result of our derivative and avago litigation 
refer to item for more details 
settlement of lawsuit in  we recorded a million reduction to operating expenses for the settlement of a derivative lawsuit 
no such charge was recorded in impairment of goodwill in  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
during our annual impairment test  because we are one reporting unit  we determined that the trading price of our stock  adjusted for a control premium which is the implied fair value  was lower than the book value 
we then performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount similar to a purchase price allocation 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and we recorded an impairment charge for the entire balance of goodwill 
no goodwill impairment charges were incurred in in process research and development in  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development  resulting from the acquisition of wj  which was completed on may  no in process research and development charges were incurred in other income expense  net other net income in decreased million  or  from the major drivers were a decrease in interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates  an increase in foreign exchange loss of million  offset by  a million impairment charge for cyoptics in that did not occur in income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to income tax expense of million in the decrease was attributable to our costa rican subsidiary new tax holiday and the expiration of certain statute of limitations related to our uncertain income tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources 
table of contents as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million  or from december  the increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations and stock issuances including withholdings for employees stock purchase plan  partially offset by capital expenditures 
at december   our net accounts receivable balance increased million  or  from december  this increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in our days sales outstanding remained flat at days as of december  and december  at december   our net inventory balance increased million  or  from december  the increase in inventory was a result of an increase in production to meet increases in demand 
inventory turns  calculated using ending inventory  were for  compared to for at december   our net property  plant and equipment increased million  or  from december  the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures of million during  which is net of the timing effects for payments of capital expenditures in prepaid expenses and accounts payable of million 
this amount was partially offset by depreciation of million 
the capital expenditures made in were for the purposes of increasing capacity  to support new products and technologies  and to replace aging equipment 
at december   our deferred tax assets increased million  or  of which million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
this increase was related to the valuation allowance release 
at december   our current liabilities increased million  or  from december  the increase was consistent with our increase in material purchases and capital expenditures 
recent transactions affecting liquidity on september   we entered into a credit agreement the agreement with a syndicated group of lenders  including bank of america  na  as administrative agent and lender 
the agreement provided us with an unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility of million 
our obligations under the agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of september   subject to a one year extension at our option and with the lenders consent 
upon the occurrence of certain events of default specified in the agreement  amounts due under the agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
as of and for the year ended december   there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement 
as a result of no amounts outstanding  there was no interest cost for the agreement or the year ended december sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  domestic and foreign together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and the balance available on our million syndicated credit facility  constitute our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe these sources of liquidity will satisfy our projected working capital  capital expenditure and possible investment needs through the next months 
we further believe our domestic cash  along with the syndicated credit facility is sufficient to meet our domestic cash requirements for the next months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are lower than expected earnings or capital expenditures in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any shortfall through additional equity offerings  debt financing or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
we currently expect capital expenditures of approximately million in other significant cash obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  that will affect our future liquidity in millions 
table of contents payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation triaccess earnout sabbatical other obligations total the amounts presented represent leases of certain equipment  office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases and includes leases related to restructuring reserve 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides eligible employees and members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are also obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the asset deferred by the participants of million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item of our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
the balance represents the earnout payment liability that has been estimated at its fair value and represents an obligation to pay up to million  over two years  to the former ta shareholders upon ta product sales meeting certain revenue thresholds 
since the earnout threshold was not met in  the remaining obligation was reduced from million to million for the remaining years 
the balance represents the estimated commitments for sabbatical payments for all eligible full time employees 
the balance represents the estimated pension liability of our german subsidiary 
the pension liability becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of the gaas business of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
we have included the reinsurance receivables of million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had approximately million of net tax liabilities  which are included as long term income tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding  revenue recognition milestone method  which provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance  management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is achieved  only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
the new standard is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  although we are still analyzing the effects of the adoption of this standard  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance regarding multiple delivered revenue arrangements which updates  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relevant selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
upon adoption  application of the residual method will no longer be permitted and entities will be required 
table of contents to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
the new standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  although we are still analyzing the effects of the adoption of this standard  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued amendments to authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures  to provide more robust disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and the transfers between levels  and the disclosure requirements about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
although we are still analyzing the effects of the adoption of this standard  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and consist of highly rated  short term investments  such as money market funds  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
in addition  at december   we did not have any investments in auction rate securities 
further  we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially affected by an immediate change in interest rates 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments as of december  in millions cost fair value cash and cash equivalents including unrealized gain of less than available for sale investments including net unrealized gain of less than foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica  the philippines and germany
