item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we currently operate primarily in two construction oriented industries light building products and heavy construction materials 
our third non core operating segment is in energy technology 
in the light building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell manufactured architectural stone  exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
revenues in the heavy construction materials segment consist primarily of ccp product sales  including fly ash used as a replacement for portland cement  along with a smaller amount from services provided to utilities relating to the disposal of ccps 
in the energy technology segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
revenues for the energy technology segment have consisted primarily of coal sales  however  in september we committed to a plan to sell our coal cleaning facilities and the coal cleaning business is now being presented as a discontinued operation 
currently  continuing revenues for the energy technology segment are expected to consist primarily of catalyst sales 
operations and strategy 
during the past several years  we have executed our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying away from our historical reliance on the legacy energy technology section k business 
our past acquisition strategy targeted businesses that were leading companies in their respective industries and that had strong operating margins  thus providing additional cash flow that complemented the financial performance of our existing businesses 
with the addition and expansion of our ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions beginning in  and the growth of our light building products business through several acquisitions beginning in  we achieved revenue growth and diversification in three business segments 
in and subsequent years  we focused on the integration of our large acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse kinds of building products through our national distribution network 
in  we began to acquire small companies in the light building products industry with innovative products that could be marketed using the distribution channels we developed over many years 
during and  we developed the coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment 
as the economy deteriorated beginning in late  we focused on operational efficiency improvements and cost reductions  particularly in the light building products and heavy construction materials segments  in order to strengthen our balance sheet 
the emphasis on cost reductions continues 
light building products segment 
our light building products segment has been significantly affected by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
accordingly  we have significantly reduced operating costs to be positively positioned to take advantage of a sustained industry turnaround when it occurs 
there has been a severe decline in new housing starts and in home sales generally  which began in and which has continued through bank foreclosures have put a large number of homes into the market for sale  effectively limiting some of the incentives to build new homes 
during  the homebuilding industry 
table of contents continued to experience soft demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale 
in addition to new construction  our light building products business also relies on the home improvement and remodeling markets 
limits on credit availability  further home foreclosures  home price depreciation  and an oversupply of homes for sale in the market may adversely affect homeowners and or homebuilders ability or desire to engage in construction or remodeling  resulting in an extended period of low new construction starts and reduced remodeling and repair activities 
we  like many others in the light building products industry  experienced a large drop in orders and a reduction in our margins in and relative to prior years 
in  and  we recorded significant goodwill impairments associated with our light building products business 
none of the impairment charges in those years affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or debt covenant compliance 
weakness continued in and and it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable and we can provide no assurances that the light building products market will improve in the near future 
while mortgage and home equity loan rates have decreased  volatility continues to exist in credit and equity markets  increased borrowing requirements prevent many potential buyers from qualifying for home mortgages and equity loans and there exists a continued lack of consumer confidence 
continued tightness of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements could adversely affect the availability of credit for purchasers of our products and thereby reduce our sales 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including the inability of prospective homebuyers or remodelers to obtain credit for financing the purchase of our building products 
these and other similar factors could continue to cause decisions to delay or forego new home construction or improvement projects  cause our customers to delay or decide not to purchase our building products  or lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance 
heavy construction materials segment 
our business strategy in the heavy construction materials industry is to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers  supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
demand for ccps is somewhat dependent on federal and state funding of infrastructure projects  which has decreased in recent years as compared to earlier periods 
we are continuing our efforts to expand the demand for high quality ccps  develop more uses for lower quality ccps  and expand our ccp disposal services and site service revenue generated from ccp management 
while all of our businesses have been affected by the current recession  the impact on our heavy construction materials segment has been somewhat less severe than on our light building products segment 
energy technology segment 
we own and operate coal cleaning facilities that remove impurities from waste coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
in  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and are pursuing divestiture of certain businesses in the energy technology segment which do not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business and we currently expect to sell the business to one or more buyers before the end of during and  many of our coal cleaning assets were idled or produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
as a result  we recorded coal cleaning asset impairments in and  including an impairment charge in to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of the inputs in the cash flow models utilized to calculate the impairment charges  however  materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would necessarily result in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
currently  continuing revenues for the energy technology segment are expected to consist primarily of catalyst sales 
in  we announced the decision by a refinery to commercially implement our hcat technology following a lengthy evaluation of the technology and we currently expect to have additional hcat 
table of contents customers in future years 
we continue to invest in research and development activities focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology  but at decreased levels compared to earlier years 
we participate in a joint venture that operates an ethanol plant located in north dakota and also participated in a joint venture that owns a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea  but we sold our interest in that joint venture in seasonality and weather 
both our light building products and our heavy construction materials segments are greatly impacted by seasonality 
revenues  profitability and ebitda are generally highest in the june and september quarters 
further  both segments are affected by weather to the extent it impacts construction activities 
debt and liquidity 
we incurred indebtedness in prior years to make strategic acquisitions  but were also able to increase cash flows and utilize that cash to reduce debt levels 
we became highly leveraged as a result of acquisitions  but reduced our outstanding debt significantly through by using cash generated from operations  from underwritten public offerings of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
during through  we made several early repayments of our long term debt 
in subsequent years  early repayments of long term debt decreased as compared to earlier years primarily due to our investments of available cash in the development of our coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment 
in  we issued senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
we also entered into a million asset based revolving loan facility abl revolver which is currently undrawn 
during and  we repaid most of our convertible senior subordinated notes and a large portion of our convertible senior subordinated notes  largely with proceeds from the sale of our interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture and a federal income tax refund 
in march  we again restructured our long term debt by issuing million of senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of those net proceeds to repay the senior secured notes issued in and the related early repayment premium of approximately million 
the senior secured notes mature in april we now have no debt maturities prior to  unless the holders of the remaining convertible senior subordinated notes exercise their put option on june  capital expenditures in and were significantly lower than prior years and this trend is currently expected to continue 
this has allowed us to focus on liquidity and the early repayment of debt and enabled us to continue implementing our overall operational strategy 
we currently have approximately million of cash on hand and additional cash flow is expected to be generated from operations over the next months 
in summary  our strategy for and subsequent years is to continue capital expenditures at reduced levels  continue activities to improve operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs  and to reduce our outstanding debt levels to the extent possible using cash on hand  cash flow from operations and cash from the sale of non core assets 
we also may review strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform when opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could 
table of contents change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefit  over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the acquisition date fair value of identified assets  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
asc topic requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if indicators of possible impairment arise 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of june  using the two step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment arise 
we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of all long lived assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the estimated useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
no significant changes have been made to estimated useful lives during the periods presented 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill is tested primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
the carrying value of a long lived asset other than goodwill is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a history of operating or cash flow losses  a decline in operating performance  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
a material goodwill impairment was recorded in and material impairments of property plant and equipment were recorded in and in connection with the goodwill impairment testing for the light building products and energy technology reporting units in  we also performed an analysis for potential impairment of other long lived assets in those reporting units  including all intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
the results of that analysis did not result in any significant impairment of any other long lived assets 
it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that any resulting write downs could be material 
property  plant and equipment as disclosed in note  in and  we recorded asset impairments in our energy technology segment 
many of our coal cleaning assets were idled or have produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
using assumptions in forecasts of future cash flows  we determined that coal cleaning asset impairments existed in and and recorded non cash impairment charges aggregating approximately million in those years  including an impairment charge in late to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 

table of contents there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of our coal cleaning assets  including future production levels  future coal prices  whether cleaned coal will be sold in the steam or metallurgical markets  the extent to which section tax credits will be earned and utilized in future periods  future operating margins  required capital expenditures  the extent  quality and productive lives of feedstock coal refuse reserves  and the potential relocation of facilities to more favorable sites or the sale of facilities  among other considerations 
we have coal cleaning facilities  two of which are managed and operated as a single unit 
asc topic property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that an analysis for potential impairment be performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
for us  this means different asset groups were required to be analyzed  each of which has many unique operating and contractual features associated with it 
asc topic also indicates that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset group are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows associated with the likely course of action  the likelihood of those possible outcomes shall be considered 
accordingly  for most operations a probability weighted approach was used in considering the likelihood of different potential outcomes 
while the coal cleaning business in its entirety has operated at a loss since inception several years ago  in  it was near breakeven from a cash flow perspective 
the business continued to operate at a loss in  and some facilities were idled or produced coal at low levels and had negative cash flows 
in and  we recorded impairments in the coal cleaning operations 
following the impairments  as of september   the coal cleaning operations carrying value of property  plant and equipment was approximately million 
for the and early impairment tests  recent historical experience was the prevalent assumption driving the cash flow models 
for some of the operations  an eventual relocation of the facilities was considered a potential outcome  and for one operation  the sale of the facility was considered a potential outcome 
for the late impairment  the assumptions included one potential outcome that all of the facilities would be sold 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of fair value level inputs in the cash flow models utilized to estimate the impairments  including current and forecasted market prices of coal  inflation  useful lives of probable reserves  historical production levels  and offers of interest to acquire the assets from third parties 
materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would necessarily result in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
if assumptions regarding future cash flows from the sale of the coal cleaning assets prove to be incorrect  headwaters may be required to record a loss or a gain when the assets are sold 
goodwill due to the continuing decline in the new housing and residential repair and remodeling markets  the continued downward revisions by market analysts of near term projections in those markets  the collapse of the credit markets in and the significant decline in our stock price during the six months ended march   management determined that indicators of goodwill impairment in the light building products reporting unit existed 
in addition  the significant declines in coal and oil prices and in our stock price indicated potential goodwill impairment in the energy technology reporting unit as well 
accordingly  we performed goodwill impairment tests for both the light building products and energy technology reporting units during the quarter ended march  upon completion of the impairment tests  we wrote off all remaining goodwill in the light building products and energy technology reporting units  totaling approximately million 
the impairment charges did not affect our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or senior debt covenant compliance 
changes in the credit markets in late and in increased our borrowing rate  which borrowing rate directly affected the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment calculations 
this increase in the discount rate led to the majority of the goodwill impairments 
the heavy construction materials reporting unit had recorded goodwill of approximately million as of september  and the goodwill impairment tests indicated no impairment for the heavy construction materials reporting unit for any test date  and accordingly  no impairment charges have been 
table of contents necessary for any period 
the estimated fair value of the heavy construction materials reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the june  test date by approximately million 
the anticipated future cash flows for this reporting unit are not currently expected to change significantly from levels 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  all three of the traditional valuation approaches  the income approach  the market approach and the asset based approach  were considered 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using the income approach  determined by discounting expected future cash flows 
this method was chosen because it specifically considers the operations  opportunities and risks applicable to the reporting units 
the market approach  specifically the guideline public company method  was also considered 
however  the reporting units direct competitors are either subsets of large corporate entities or are privately held 
therefore  there is limited comparability between the reporting units and the potential guideline public companies 
accordingly  the guideline public company method was utilized only as a reasonableness test of the results from the income approach 
finally  the asset based approach was also considered  however  it was not utilized because it does not consider the income producing going concern nature of the reporting units assets 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units are calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing these expected future cash flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management uses its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is probable that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
the most sensitive assumptions for the income approach were the discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital  the expected long term growth rate and expected future gross profit margins 
for the light building products reporting unit  a discount rate of was used in each change in the discount rate would have changed the fair value of the reporting unit by approximately million 
the long term growth rate used was 
each change in the long term growth rate would have changed the fair value by approximately million 
the expected future gross profit margins used ranged from 
each change in the gross profit margins would have changed the fair value by approximately million 
our light building products segment gross margin percentage for the years through was   and  respectively 
the year over year revenue growth decrease was   and over the same period 
the results for reflect the dramatic slowing of the light building products industry  however  we did not believe that those conditions were indicative of the long term future of the housing market 
the housing market is extremely cyclical and the cycles can vary materially in length and scope 
average housing starts reported by the us national association of home builders nahb for the previous seventeen years  including calendar  were million units per year 
while the estimated housing starts for calendar were million  the five year average that included then current estimates for calendar and indicated estimated average housing starts of more than million units  which was nearly higher than the calendar actual starts 
we believe that the gross profit margins used in the cash flow forecast of in  which were consistent with our actual levels  were reasonable in the long term  especially given productivity improvements being implemented through application of lean manufacturing techniques 
we also believe that the long term revenue growth rate of was likely to be achieved when the housing market rebounded 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments are routinely required in the calculation of our income tax provisions 
we utilized our and prior net operating losses nols by carrying these amounts back to prior years  receiving income tax refunds 
the nols and tax credit carryforwards were offset by existing 
table of contents deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  in  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets and recorded a minimal income tax benefit even though there was a pre tax loss of approximately million 
the reported income tax rate for of near is due to not recognizing benefit for pre tax losses and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
because the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future income in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that have generated losses  management determined that we no longer meet the more likely than not threshold that nols  tax credits and other deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is required 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
in the years presented  section refined coal tax credits have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits 
there are multiple bases upon which the irs may challenge the tax credits  including whether our facilities were placed in service for the purpose of producing refined coal  whether the facilities use waste coal as a feedstock  and whether the testing methods and certifications adequately demonstrate the required emissions reductions 
in addition  congress may modify or repeal section so that these tax credits may not be available in the future 
through september   we have earned total income tax credits of approximately million related to section tax credits 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a significant goodwill impairment charge in most of the impairment charge was not tax deductible 
therefore  the goodwill impairment charge had a significant negative effect on our income tax provision for that year 
as of september   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
in  we completed an audit by the irs for the years through  which did not result in any material changes to earnings or tax related liabilities 
we are currently under audit by the irs for and have open tax periods subject to examination by various taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur or do not occur as expected and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
these changes could be the result of our ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the issues being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made  beyond amounts currently accrued 
litigation 
we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 

table of contents we incurred approximately million  million and million of expense for legal matters in  and  respectively 
until  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have historically comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved legal matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million  of which million was expensed during claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel and management currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 
summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in our operating loss was million compared to operating income of million in  and the loss from continuing operations increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in our net loss including discontinued operations increased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in there were several significant non routine adjustments recorded in  including approximately million of asset impairments and restructuring charges  million of accrued legal costs related to a judgment in an ongoing legal matter  and million of interest expense related to our senior debt refinancing of which approximately million was for the early repayment premium relating to the repurchase of the senior secured notes in march 
in addition  in  we did not recognize income tax benefits attributable to our pre tax operating losses and tax credits as we have in prior years 
these adjustments and others are discussed in more detail below 
revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below  by segment 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in was due primarily to a weather related slow start to the construction season 
the gross margin decreased primarily because of increases in transportation  materials especially siding accessories and production costs 
cost increases impacted all of our major product lines  most notably our manufactured architectural stone and siding accessories categories 
the significant weakness in the new housing and residential remodeling markets which began several years ago continued during we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements and cost 
table of contents reductions have tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in the housing market  however  the recession has resulted in high unemployment  adding to the high level of home foreclosures  putting additional homes on the market and further reducing the demand for new construction 
new housing starts according to the national association of home builders were million units in both calendar and through september  the seasonally adjusted annual number of new housing starts was million units 
these numbers compare to and year averages of million and million units  respectively 
our light building products business relies on the home improvement and remodeling market as well as new construction 
the us census bureau s value of private residential construction spending put in place data on homeowner improvement activity shows that the four quarter moving average peaked at billion in the second quarter of calendar  fell to billion in the first quarter of calendar  then rose to billion in the second quarter of calendar the leading indicator of remodeling activity estimate issued by the joint center for housing studies at harvard university has estimated that the four quarter moving averages will be billion and billion in the first and second quarters of calendar  respectively  which would be the lowest levels since early calendar given our market leadership positions and reduced cost structure  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from a rebound in the housing market when it occurs 
we believe the long term growth prospects in the industry are strong because the current seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts are still well below the and year averages 
according to the harvard joint center for housing studies  the nation s housing stock will have to accommodate approximately million to million additional households due to population growth over the next decade  or approximately million to million households per year 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to lower service revenues in  caused by the completion of certain one time projects 
the decline in revenue and higher transportation costs  were the primary drivers of the lower gross margin in than in it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of either cement consumption or cement prices  nor the correlation between cement usage and prices and fly ash sales and prices 
nevertheless  because fly ash is sold as a replacement for portland cement in a wide variety of concrete uses including infrastructure  commercial  and residential construction statistics and trends for portland and blended cement sales can be an indicator for fly ash sales 
according to the bureau of labor statistics  the producer price index for cement declined from september to september in july  the portland cement association s cement consumption forecast reflected a increase for calendar  a increase for calendar  followed by an increase of for calendar in june  the epa proposed two alternative rules to regulate ccps generated by electric utilities and independent power producers 
one proposed option would classify ccps disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills as special wastes subject to federal hazardous waste regulation under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the second proposed option would instead regulate ccps as non hazardous waste under subtitle d of rcra  with states retaining the lead authority on regulating their handling  storage and disposal 
under both options  the current exemption from hazardous waste regulation for ccps that are used for beneficial purposes would remain in effect 
however  the epa has received comments on refining the definition of beneficial uses subject to the exemption  which could result in a narrowing of the scope of exempt uses in the final rule 
both rule options are controversial 
on october   the us house of representatives approved bipartisan legislation to regulate the disposal of fly ash by a vote of to hr  the coal residuals reuse and management act  provides a non hazardous fly ash disposal regulatory program  granting a primary role for states to manage fly ash disposal with federal supervision and national standards 
on october   comparable legislation was introduced in the us senate 

table of contents at this time  it is not possible to predict what form final regulations will take 
either of the proposed options is likely to increase the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of ccps 
if the epa decides to regulate ccps as hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c  ccps would become subject to a variety of regulations 
regulation of ccps as hazardous waste would likely have an adverse effect on beneficial use and sales of ccps and our relationships with utilities 
there can be no guarantee that such regulations would not reduce or eliminate our supply or our ability to market fly ash and other ccps which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition 
energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for both periods included catalyst sales million and million in and  respectively and equity earnings from our joint venture investment in an ethanol plant located in north dakota million and million in and  respectively 
revenues in also included million of equity earnings from our joint venture investment in a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea which was sold in late sales of our proprietary hcat hydrocracking technology catalyst have increased due to the continued use at two refineries 
we continue to market to additional refinery customers and have delivered proposals to some prospects 
given the time required to install our proprietary mixing process  we do not expect a significant revenue increase from hcat sales until operating expenses  including asset impairments and restructuring costs 
amortization expenses were materially consistent from to research and development expenses decreased approximately million from to  primarily due to decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies in the energy segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  to million in from million in the increase in was due primarily to the million accrual for litigation expense recognized during reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the million of litigation expenses  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or  from to this decrease was attributable primarily to lower incentive compensation expenses in and lower professional services expenses  particularly million of non routine costs that were expensed in for consultations related to recapitalization transactions that occurred in and other periods 
in  we recorded an approximate million impairment charge for assets related to a ccp loading facility that was not being utilized for fly ash shipments as originally planned 
in  we recorded approximately million of restructuring costs as a result of actions taken to lower operating costs and improve operational efficiency  primarily in the light building products segment 
the charges consisted of workforce reductions and related severance expenses  facility closures and consolidations  and certain asset impairments and write downs  as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional restructuring costs related to the actions taken in  currently estimated to be approximately million  will be incurred in the restructuring effort was initiated primarily due to the ongoing depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets and is currently expected to be completed in other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the increase in net other expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million plus a decrease in net other revenue of approximately million 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to approximately million of premium relating to the early retirement of our senior secured notes plus approximately million of accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs associated with that early repayment  all as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases in interest expense related to the senior debt refinancing were partially offset by the lower rate senior debt which was outstanding for part of as compared to  lower interest on reduced balances of convertible debt in  and 
table of contents decreased premiums and accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs related to early retirements of convertible debt in based on the current balances of outstanding long term debt  interest expense in is currently expected to total approximately million 
the decrease in net other income of million was primarily the result of a million gain on the sale of our equity interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture in income tax provision 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the near income tax benefit recorded in and the income tax benefit recorded in  including the reasons for recording a full valuation allowance on net operating losses  tax credits and other deferred tax assets in discontinued operations 
coal sales of million in were lower than sales of million in primarily due to a decrease in tons sold at some facilities 
due to ongoing feedstock issues  low capacity utilization and idled facilities  the cost of revenue related to the coal cleaning business exceeded revenues in both and during the september quarter  the coal cleaning facilities operated at of aggregate capacity and as of september   operations at three of the facilities have been curtailed 
in addition to the losses from operations incurred in both years  asset impairments of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
largely due to the increased impairment charges in compared to  along with the million income tax provision recorded in as compared to the million tax benefit recorded in  there was a significant increase in the loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  to million in from million in reference is made to the sections titled overview and critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill for more background about the presentation of the coal cleaning business as a discontinued operation and for a detailed description of the procedures and estimates used in calculating an impairment 
we currently expect to sell the coal cleaning business to one or more buyers before the end of depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million and million was recorded in and  respectively  for the coal cleaning assets classified as held for sale in the september  consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the classification of those assets as held for sale  all depreciation and amortization has ceased 
it is currently expected that some losses will be incurred in operating some of the coal cleaning facilities until such time as they are sold  however  it is not currently possible to know when the facilities will be sold  or what the losses might be until that time 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 
summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit increased  from million in to million in our operating loss decreased from million in to operating income of million in  and the loss from continuing operations decreased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a loss of million  or per diluted share  in excluding the goodwill impairment of approximately million in  operating income increased from million in to million in the net loss including discontinued operations decreased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in 
table of contents revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in was due primarily to lower sales from our regional block category  and to a lesser extent  the continuing effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets which impacted sales across many of our other product lines 
our light building products business stabilized somewhat during the latter part of and we began to experience some growth in several product categories within certain geographic areas 
revenues from our siding accessories and architectural stone product categories increased by in the last half of as compared to the last half of the gross margin percentage increased from to due primarily to cost reduction efforts initiated in  which improved overall manufacturing productivity 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to a reduction in concrete consumption in the western us  particularly california and nevada  largely offset by increased revenue from site service contracts in the central and eastern regions of the us the reduction in concrete consumption resulted primarily from declines in commercial construction and state infrastructure spending 
the gross margin percentage decreased from to primarily because of product mix  a higher percentage of service revenue compared to product sales and fewer fixed costs being absorbed as a result of lower total sales 
energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for both periods included equity earnings from our joint venture investments in an ethanol plant located in north dakota and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea which was sold in late revenues for also included catalyst sales of million  but there were no catalyst sales in operating expenses  including impairments 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets in along with intangible assets that became fully amortized in research and development expense decreased by million from to  primarily because of lower spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies beginning in january selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due to reduced spending in most categories of expense  with the exception of incentive pay 
in  we recorded an approximate million impairment charge for assets related to a ccp loading facility that was not being utilized for fly ash shipments as originally planned 
with regard to the million goodwill impairment in  reference is made to the discussion in critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the increase in net other expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in net other income of approximately million 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to i significantly higher interest expense related to million of new senior secured notes issued in 
table of contents early  compared to a lower average balance of previous lower interest rate senior secured debt that was outstanding during  and ii approximately million of premium associated with the early repayment of million of our convertible debt in the increase in net other income of million was primarily the result of a million gain on the sale of our equity interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture in  a net loss in of approximately million from convertible debt extinguishment and conversion transactions  and approximately million more gain on sale of property  plant and equipment in than in income tax provision 
the recorded income tax benefit rates for and were and  respectively 
exclusive of the goodwill impairment in  most of which was not tax deductible  the effective rate would have approximated the statutory rate for that year 
the effective tax benefit rates  disregarding goodwill impairment in  differ from the statutory rate primarily due to section tax credits 
section refined coal tax credits have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits 
discontinued operations 
coal sales of million in were materially consistent with sales of million in the cost of revenue related to the coal cleaning business exceeded revenues in both and in addition to the losses from operations incurred in both years  an asset impairment of million was recorded in the impairment charge in was the primary reason for the increase in the loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  to million in from million in reference is made to the section titled critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill for a detailed description of the procedures and estimates used in calculating an impairment 
impact of inflation and related matters in certain periods  some of our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities  such as polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride in the light building products segment 
while the negative impact was generally somewhat less significant during than during prior years  during  we have experienced some significant cost increases for certain raw materials and transportation fuel 
we currently believe it is possible that costs for raw materials and other commodities such as fuels  along with the prices of other goods and services  could continue to increase in future periods 
in and in prior years  we have passed through certain increased raw materials costs to customers  but it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on future price increases 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended september  was million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended september  
the net loss in exceeded the net loss in primarily due to several non routine adjustments some of which did not involve the use of cash  including approximately million of asset impairments and restructuring costs in  compared to million of asset impairments in  million of accrued legal costs related to a judgment in an ongoing legal matter  and million of interest expense related to our senior debt refinancing 
in addition  in  we reported income tax benefits for continuing and discontinued operations combined of approximately million and had approximately million of income tax refunds 
in  we reported net income tax expense for continuing and discontinued operations combined of million and paid approximately million for income taxes 
the cash related change in net loss constitutes the most significant difference between the two periods in cash flows from operating activities 

table of contents in both periods  our primary investing activity consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
also in both periods  our financing activities consisted primarily of a significant restructuring of our long term debt  resulting in the issuance of new senior secured notes and the repayment of former senior secured debt and a portion of our outstanding convertible debt 
more details about these and other investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
total expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were million  an increase of million over in both periods  the majority of capital expenditures related to the maintenance of operating capacity in our light building products segment 
total capital expenditures are currently expected to be near the and levels 
capital expenditures are limited by the terms of our abl revolver to million in as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
in and  we realized million and million  respectively  of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  most of which represented non strategic assets in our light building products segment 
in  we had a net increase of approximately million for long term receivables and deposits  primarily in the energy technology segment 
in  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of two privately held companies in the light building products industry for total consideration of approximately million 
as noted earlier  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and are pursuing divestiture of certain businesses in the energy technology segment which do not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business  and we currently expect to sell the business to one or more buyers before the end of at the current time  it is not possible to predict the amount of cash we will realize upon sale of the coal cleaning business nor the amount of cash we will expend operating the facilities until such time as they are sold 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations and commercialization of technologies currently being developed 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of our long term business strategy  however  primarily because of covenant restrictions under our former senior secured notes  but also due to cash flow considerations and recent events affecting the debt and equity markets  we made only one small acquisition in and two small acquistions in we have also invested in joint ventures  one of which was sold in  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
we do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in any of the remaining joint venture entities 
current debt agreements limit potential acquisitions and investments in joint ventures 
during the four year term of the abl revolver  our acquisitions and investments in joint ventures and other less than owned entities are limited to total cumulative consideration of million and million annually 
financing activities 
in october  we issued approximately million of senior secured notes due for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the net proceeds to repay all of our obligations under the former senior secured credit facility and the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
in connection with the termination of the former credit facility and early repayment of the debt  we wrote off all remaining related debt issue costs  aggregating approximately million 
in addition  in connection with consultations related to recapitalization transactions that occurred in and other periods  we incurred million of costs that were expensed during  which amount is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations 
also in october  we entered into a million abl revolver for which we incurred approximately million of debt issue costs 
in march  we issued million of senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the net proceeds to repay the senior secured notes described above and the related early repayment premium of approximately million which premium was charged to interest expense 
the notes mature in april and bear interest at a rate of  payable semiannually 
the notes are secured by substantially all of our assets  with the exception of joint venture assets  however  the 
table of contents note holders have a second priority position with respect to the assets that secure the abl revolver  currently consisting of certain trade receivables and inventories of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments 
the notes are senior in priority to all other outstanding and future subordinated debt 
other terms of the new senior secured notes including redemption features  the abl revolver and our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the march refinancing accomplished several objectives  the most important of which was to extend the maturity of our senior debt 
it also reduced our future annual interest expense by approximately million and increased our future annual cash flow by approximately million 
in  we entered into separate  privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes to repurchase and cancel million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
terms of repayment included payment of a premium of of par  or million  which was recorded as interest expense 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were also charged to interest expense 
in  we repurchased and canceled million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
terms of repayment included premiums totaling approximately million  which were recorded as interest expense 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were also charged to interest expense 
following these transactions  approximately million of the notes remained outstanding as of september  there are currently no maturities of debt prior to  unless the holders of the notes exercise their put option on june  we also have the option to redeem the notes on or after june  during  we repurchased and canceled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes 
terms of repayment included premiums totaling approximately million  which were recorded as interest expense 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were also charged to interest expense 
approximately million of these notes remained outstanding as of september  subsequent to september   we repurchased and canceled million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for cash consideration of approximately million 
as of november   million of these notes remained outstanding 
as a result of the senior debt refinancing and the repayments of convertible notes in as described above  we have reduced annual cash interest expense on our long term debt from levels by approximately million  to an annual run rate of approximately million 
following certain asset sales  as defined  we could be required to prepay a portion of the senior secured notes 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  the senior secured notes and abl revolver limit the incurrence of additional debt and liens on assets  prepayment of future subordinated debt  merging or consolidating with another company  selling all or substantially all assets  making capital expenditures  making acquisitions and investments and the payment of dividends or distributions  among other things 
in addition  if availability under the abl revolver is less than of the total million commitment  or million currently  we are required to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of at least x for the preceding twelve month period 
there have been no borrowings under the abl revolver since it was entered into in october the abl revolver terminates three months prior to the earliest maturity date of the senior secured notes or any of the convertible senior subordinated notes currently november  but no later than october  at which time any amounts borrowed must be repaid 
availability under the abl revolver cannot exceed million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
availability under the abl revolver is further limited by the borrowing base valuations of the assets of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments which secure the borrowings  currently consisting of certain trade receivables and inventories 
in addition to the first lien position on these assets  the abl revolver lenders have a 
table of contents second priority position on substantially all other assets 
as of september   availability under the abl revolver was approximately million 
however  due primarily to the seasonality of our operations  the amount of availability varies from period to period and  while not currently expected  it is possible that the availability under the abl revolver could fall below the threshold  or million  in a future period 
as of september   our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the abl revolver agreement  is approximately the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing ebitdar minus capital expenditures and cash payments for income taxes by fixed charges 
ebitdar consists of net income loss i plus net interest expense  income taxes as defined  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges such as goodwill and other impairments  and rent expense  ii plus or minus other specified adjustments such as equity earnings or loss in joint ventures 
fixed charges consist of cash payments for debt service plus rent expense 
if availability under the abl revolver were to decline below million at some future date and the fixed charge coverage ratio were to also be below  the abl revolver lender could issue a notice of default 
if a notice of default were to become imminent  we would seek an amendment to the abl revolver  or alternatively  a waiver of the availability requirement and or fixed charge coverage ratio for a period of time 
approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under a universal shelf registration statement which the sec declared effective in the shelf registration expires in april a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering could commence under the registration statement 
in both periods  cash proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of options were not material 
option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts were not material in either period 
working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million including million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of september  the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from cash used in operations and for debt service  all as described previously 
notwithstanding the continuing pressure on our revenues as a result of existing economic conditions  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow in and in future years 
we currently believe working capital will be sufficient for our operating needs in  and that it will not be necessary to utilize borrowing capacity under the abl revolver for our seasonal operational cash needs during income taxes 
for  cash outlays for income taxes were only million  consisting primarily of payments to settle an irs audit and state income taxes in certain state jurisdictions where we generated taxable income 
we have utilized our and prior year federal nols by carrying those amounts back to prior years  receiving income tax refunds which totaled approximately million in 
nols and tax credit carryforwards for were offset by our existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  in  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets 
as of september   our nol and capital loss carryforwards total approximately million tax effected 
the us and state nols and capital losses expire from to substantially all of the non us nols do not expire 
in addition  there are approximately million of tax credit carryforwards as of september   which expire from to we do not currently expect cash outlays for income taxes in to be significant 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which amounts were not material in either period 
option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price which is not predictable  and likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises  if any 

table of contents summary of future cash requirements 
significant cash requirements for the next months  beyond seasonal operational working capital requirements  consist primarily of interest payments on long term debt and capital expenditures 
in future periods  significant cash requirements will also include the repayment of debt  but not prior to  or june if the convertible senior subordinated notes totaling approximately million are put to us 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements where the potential risks of litigation are described in detail 
adverse conclusions to those legal matters could involve material amounts of cash outlays in future periods 
legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and for other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  but otherwise do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary by period of our contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured notes convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations we may redeem at par any portion of the convertible senior subordinated notes due june on or after june  in addition  the holders of the notes  totaling million  have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  accordingly  that debt has been classified as current  and the related interest payments on that debt are presumed to cease as of june  if the debt is not repaid until the contractual repayment date in june  the timing of repayment of million of debt obligations will change  and additional interest totaling approximately million would be owed in the years through as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our abl revolver provides for potential borrowings of up to million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including million of potential interest and penalties 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments 

table of contents reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under employment agreements  cash performance unit awards  cash settled sars and executive change in control agreements 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of those agreements  depending upon the outcomes of the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
final resolutions of these matters that are different from our current expectations could affect the amounts included in the above table 
recent accounting pronouncements reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been issued which we have not yet adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to our stock price and the activities of one of our joint ventures  the blue flint joint venture  which has derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
future borrowings  if any  under our abl revolver will bear interest at a variable rate  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to the sale in of our interest in the south korean joint venture with evonik industries ag  we have limited operations in foreign jurisdictions 
the south korean joint venture was subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements through the date of sale 
during the year ended september   the joint venture recorded foreign currency exchange gains  of which million was included in our results of operations 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the compensation committee approved grants of performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  to be settled in cash  based on the achievement of goals related to consolidated free cash flow generated in the second half of fiscal in  we reversed approximately million of previously recognized expense for the performance unit awards due to a decrease in the average day stock price from september  to september  all future changes in our stock price through the final vest date of september  will result in adjustment of the expected liability  which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter 
assuming the average closing stock price for the days in the period ended september  of remains unchanged for the september  vesting date  the total payouts under this arrangement for both vest dates  all of which have been accrued as of september   would be approximately million 
a change in the day average stock price as of september  from the september  average of would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the september  payout liability 
in  the committee approved grants to certain employees of approximately million cash settled sars 
these sars will vest in annual installments through september   provided the participant is still employed at the respective vesting dates  and will be settled in cash upon exercise by the employee 
the sars terminate on september  and must be exercised on or before that date 
as of september   has been accrued for these awards because the stock price at september  was below the grant date stock price of 
future changes in our stock price in any amount beyond the grant date stock price of 
table of contents through september  will result in adjustment to the expected liability  which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter 
if all of the sars ultimately vest and the stock price is above the grant date stock price  a change in the stock price of would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the ultimate payout liability
