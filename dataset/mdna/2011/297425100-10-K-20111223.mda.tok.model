our current business and strategic plan focuses on the continued development of our products principally for aerospace and defense markets 
we are concentrating our efforts to expand our capabilities in these markets and to anticipate the global needs of our customers and respond to such needs with comprehensive solutions 
these efforts focus on continuous research and new product development  acquisitions and strategic realignments of operations to expand our capabilities as a more comprehensive supplier to our customers across our entire product offering 
on july   the company acquired the souriau group souriau 
souriau is a leading global supplier of highly engineered connection technologies for harsh environments 
souriau is included in our sensors systems segment 
on december   the company acquired eclipse electronic systems  inc eclipse 
eclipse is a designer and manufacturer of embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications 
eclipse is included in our avionics controls segment 
on september   we sold pressure systems  inc psi  which was included in the sensors systems segment 
the results of psi are accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
on november   we sold muirhead aerospace muirhead and traxsys input products limited traxsys 
muirhead and traxsys were included in the sensors systems segment 
the results of muirhead and traxsys are accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share compared with million or per diluted share in the prior year period 
the decrease in income from continuing operations reflected reduced operating earnings from avionics controls and sensors systems  increased operating earnings from advanced materials and the effect of souriau acquisition related expenses 
the decrease in operating earnings of avionics controls reflected lower sales and earnings of avionics systems and communication systems due to reduced requirements from defense customers  as well as the timing of receiving orders and increased research  engineering and development expense 
the decrease at sensors systems reflected an operating loss at souriau of million due primarily to the purchase accounting requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired inventory as expense over the first inventory turn 
the increase at advanced materials reflected strong earnings from our engineered materials operations and a gain on sale of a facility  partially offset by decreased earnings of our defense technologies operations due to lower demand from countermeasures 
income from continuing operations was also impacted by higher interest expense and benefited from a lower income tax rate of compared to in the prior year period 
the decrease in the income tax rate mainly reflected income tax benefits associated with the acquisition of souriau and lower earnings in the fourth fiscal quarter of during fiscal  income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share compared with million or per diluted share during fiscal  reflecting improved sales and earnings from avionics controls and advanced materials and weaker results from sensors systems 
sales and operating earnings were strong the first half of the year compared to the prior year period and weaker in the second half of the year  principally reflecting reduced sales and earnings from our defense focused business operations and the operating loss of souriau due to the inventory fair value adjustment noted above 
avionics controls reflected strong sales and earnings of avionics systems and control systems and weaker sales and earnings of communication systems and interface technologies 
sensors systems reflected improved sales and earnings of power systems and advanced sensors  partially offset by the operating loss of souriau 
advanced materials results reflected strong sales and earnings from engineered materials and weak performance from defense technologies  primarily due to decreased demand for countermeasures 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal net income in fiscal was million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal fiscal included income from discontinued operations of per diluted share in fiscal  reflecting the gain on the sale of psi in september results of continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal increased over the prior year 
sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the million or increase in avionics controls mainly reflected increased sales volumes of avionics systems of million  control systems of million  and communication systems of million  mostly offset by decreased sales volumes of interface technologies systems 
the increase in avionics systems principally reflected strong sales volumes of avionics products of million 
the increase in control systems reflected strong oem and after market sales and a million retroactive price settlement due to product scope changes 
the first six months of fiscal benefited from higher demand for after market spares due to restocking of depleted inventory by our customers 
during the second six months  demand levels for spares declined and more closely reflected the underlying activity of the flying fleet 
our after market spares sales volume level for fiscal is forecasted to continue this trend 
the increased sales of communication systems principally reflected million in incremental sales from the eclipse acquisition completed in the first fiscal quarter of  partially offset by decreased sales of hearing protection headset devices due to uncertainty over the us and us military budgets 
avionics controls segment sales are expected to increase modestly to about million in fiscal  reflecting a strong commercial aerospace market  improved requirements for headsets and embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications  higher requirements for input devices for medical applications  and partially offset by lower sales of avionics systems due to delayed orders for retrofits of military transport aircraft 
the million or increase in sensors systems mainly reflected incremental sales from the souriau acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal of million and increased sales volumes of advanced sensors of million and power systems of million 
the increase in advanced sensors sales mainly reflected strong aftermarket demand for temperature and pressure sensors 
the increase in power systems mainly reflected higher oem and retrofit sales for commercial aviation 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  souriau s sales were impacted by lower demand for industrial applications  which is expected to continue in the first fiscal quarter of and improve over the remaining three fiscal quarters of as sales for defense  nuclear  and other industrial applications increase 
segment sales in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal reflected a stronger pound sterling and euro compared to the us dollar compared to the prior year period  while sales in the first quarter of fiscal reflected a weaker pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar relative to the prior year period 
sensors systems sales in fiscal are expected to be nearly million in fiscal  reflecting a full year of souriau s sales 
the million or increase in sales of advanced materials principally reflected a million decrease in sales volumes of defense technologies and a million increase in sales of engineered materials 
the decrease in sales of defense technologies mainly reflected lower sales volumes of countermeasures  principally due to lower requirements from our non us customers 
the increase in sales of engineered materials reflected strong demand for elastomer and insulation materials for commercial aerospace applications 
advanced materials segment sales are expected to be nearly million in fiscal  reflecting strong commercial aerospace and energy markets and improved demand for non us flare countermeasures 
foreign sales  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million compared to million in the prior year period 
about of the net million increase in segment gross profit was due to strong sales volume and improved gross margin on avionics systems 
this reflects increased sales volumes of aviation products and higher gross margin on cockpit integration sales 
nearly of the increase in segment gross profit reflected robust sales of control systems due to strong aftermarket demand and the million retroactive price increase referenced above 
control systems gross profit was impacted by a million charge in the fourth fiscal quarter of for engineering costs not probable of recovery from the customer 
eclipse s gross profit was impacted by purchase accounting requirements resulting in a million inventory fair value adjustment and recognizing the adjustment as expense over the first inventory turn  approximately million was recorded as an expense in the fourth fiscal quarter of interface technologies gross profit decreased by approximately million  principally due to lower demand and gross margin for interface devices for casino gaming applications 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
connection technologies reported only minimal gross profit  net of a million inventory fair value adjustment  principally recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of an additional million in fair value adjustments will be recognized in the first fiscal quarter of approximately of the increase in segment gross profit was due to increased sales volumes of pressure sensors for oem and aftermarket requirements 
about of the increase in segment gross profit was due to improved gross margin on power systems reflecting increased retrofit and oem sales 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
a million increase in engineered materials gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit at our defense technologies operations 
the increase in engineered materials gross profit was principally due to increased sales volumes of elastomer and insulation material for commercial aerospace applications 
the decrease in gross profit of defense technologies mainly reflected lower sales volumes of countermeasures 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the million increase reflected an increase of million of corporate expense  million at our avionics controls segment  and million at our sensors systems segment 
the million increase at corporate primarily reflects souriau acquisition related expenses  approximately million was incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of the million increase at avionics controls reflects million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related to the eclipse acquisition 
the million increase at sensors systems reflects million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related to the souriau acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses at advanced materials increased slightly compared to the prior year period reflecting million for an estimated liability for an environmental issue  million in severance at our defense technologies operations and a million expense principally related to the write off of accounts receivable 
these increases were principally offset by a million gain on a sale of a facility and an insurance recovery in fiscal research  development and related engineering spending increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the million increase in research  development and related engineering expense principally reflects million in higher spending on avionics systems  million on control systems and million on communication systems 
in fiscal we benefited from million in foreign currency exchange gains associated with funding the acquisition of souriau 
segment earnings operating earnings excluding corporate expenses and other income or expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million or of sales  compared with million or of sales  for the prior year period 
the million decrease in earnings mainly reflected the operating loss of souriau of million  principally due to the fair value inventory adjustment noted above and partially offset by incremental earnings of eclipse of million 
the decrease also reflected weaker operating earnings at our avionics systems and communications headset operations totaling million and defense technologies countermeasure operations totaling million  partially offset by stronger operating results at our engineered materials operations of million 
avionics systems earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by higher research and development expense and lower shipments of the integrated cockpit for the t b military trainer compared to the same periods last year 
the decrease at communication systems and defense technologies was due to lower demand for headsets and flare countermeasures  respectively  which reflect slower than expected order releases from our defense customers 
engineered materials operations benefited from strong demand for elastomer and insulation materials for commercial aerospace 
the decrease in segment earnings also reflected a million write off of engineering costs at controls systems  a million inventory and accounts receivable write off at advanced sensors  a million write off of accounts receivable and inventory at defense technologies  and a million late delivery penalty at engineering materials  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of an engineered material facility 
segment earnings for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  mainly reflecting a million increase in avionics systems  a million increase in control systems  a million decrease in communication systems  and a million decrease in interface technologies 
avionics systems benefited from strong gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in research  development and engineering expense and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  reflecting increased bid and proposal expense and incentive compensation 
control systems benefited from increased gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in research  engineering and development  net of a million recovery of non recurring engineering expense upon settlement with the customer 
the decrease in communication systems earnings mainly reflected decreased gross profit from lower sales of certain communication systems for audio and data products for severe battlefield environments  resulting in a million decrease in communication systems earnings  partially offset by incremental income from the eclipse acquisition 
we expect that segment operating earnings will be about of sales on sales of million for fiscal  reflecting a strong commercial aerospace market and improved sales and profits from sales of headset devices and embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting a million increase in advanced sensors and a million increase in power systems  both operations benefiting from increased gross profit 
souriau incurred an operating loss of million  principally reflecting the inventory fair value adjustment referenced above 
as noted above  souriau s operating results will be impacted by a million fair value inventory adjustment in the first fiscal quarter of we expect that segment earnings will be nearly of sales on sales of million  reflecting a strong commercial aerospace market  stronger demand for connectors for industrial applications in the second half of the fiscal year and fully recognizing the fair value inventory adjustment related to the souriau acquisition in the first fiscal quarter of advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  primarily reflecting increased earnings from sales of engineered materials  partially offset by a million decrease in defense technologies 
the increase in engineered materials principally reflected the increase in gross profit  a million gain on sale of a facility  partially offset by a million increase in an estimated liability for an environmental issue 
defense technologies principally reflected a million decrease in earnings for countermeasures operations and increased earnings of combustible ordnance 
the decrease in earnings for countermeasures mainly reflected the decrease in gross profit and certain charges in the fourth fiscal quarter of totaling million  consisting principally of a write off of an accounts receivable of million and million in inventory 
also  million in severance was recorded in the third fiscal quarter of we expect that segment earnings will be nearly of sales on sales of about million  reflecting a strong commercial aerospace market and improved sales and profitability from sales of international flare countermeasures 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting higher borrowings 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
during fiscal  we recognized million of discrete income tax benefits as a result of the following items million of income tax benefits due to the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation credits and the release of a valuation allowance related to a net operating loss of an acquired subsidiary  million of income tax benefits associated with net operating losses of an acquired subsidiary as a result of concluding a tax examination  million of net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enactment of income tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate  and million of income tax expense as a result of reconciling the prior year s income tax returns to the prior year s provision for income tax 
we expect the income tax rate to be approximately in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of four events 
the first event was a million benefit as a result of the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions mainly associated with losses on the disposition of assets 
this release of tax reserves resulted from the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the second event was a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities  which was the result of the enactment of tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate 
the third event was a million tax expense related to tax liabilities associated with an examination of the us federal and state income tax returns 
the fourth event was a million reduction of valuation allowances related to acquired net operating losses and foreign tax credits that were generated in prior years 
the income tax rate differed from the statutory rate in fiscal and  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
it is reasonably possible that within the next months approximately million of tax benefits associated with research and experimentation tax credits  capital and operating losses that are currently unrecognized could be recognized as a result of settlement of examinations and or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and are as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders increased across all of our segments  principally reflecting the acquired backlog of eclipse and souriau and partially offset by order declines for avionics systems  certain communication systems and defense technologies

about of the increase in segment gross profit was due to strong sales of avionics systems  reflecting increased sales volumes of cockpit integration for the t b military trainer and a military transport cockpit retrofit program 
the remaining increase in segment gross profit reflected strong sales volumes of interface technologies systems and communication systems  partially offset by an million decrease in control systems 
the increase in interface technologies gross profit is due to higher sales volumes of input devices for casino gaming applications and higher sales volumes for medical applications 
the increase in communication systems gross profit mainly reflects incremental gross profit from the acquisition of racal acoustics in the first fiscal quarter of the decrease in gross profit on control systems is mainly due to weaker gross margin of controls for commercial and military applications  as well as higher operating costs from our new control systems facility 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit is principally due to the effect of a decrease in advanced sensors sales volume in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was mainly due to a million inventory write off in fiscal power systems gross profit improved slightly due to retrofits for commercial aviation applications and strong cost control  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting an increase in defense technologies offset by a small decrease in engineered materials 
the increased gross profit on defense technologies reflected a million increase on countermeasures  partially offset by decreased gross profit on combustible ordnance

interface technologies benefited from strong gross profit from sales of input devices for casino gaming and medical applications 
the increase in communication systems earnings was due to incremental earnings from the racal acoustics acquisition of million and improved gross margin 
control systems earnings were impacted by decreased gross profit and million in increased development costs 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  mainly reflecting a million decrease in advanced sensors gross profit  offset by decreased selling  general and administrative expenses  principally due to the million impairment on a subsidiary trade name recorded in fiscal advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  primarily reflecting a million increase in defense technologies  partially offset by decreased earnings from sales of engineered materials 
defense technologies principally reflected a million increase in earnings for countermeasures operations and decreased earnings of combustible ordnance 
the increase in countermeasures earnings reflected strong gross profit and a turnaround from a million operating loss incurred in fiscal the decrease in combustible ordnance is due to decreased gross profit 
the reduction in engineered materials earnings reflected million in costs associated with closing a facility and a million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains  principally on forward contracts which are marked to market each period 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting increased senior debt and higher borrowings under capitalized lease obligations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid off million in senior subordinated debt and incurred a loss of million due to the extinguishment of debt 
on january   we acquired racal acoustics for million or million 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense market segment 
the acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the sale of uk based muirhead and traxsys and our line of credit 
to facilitate the acquisition of racal acoustics  we executed a million us dollar denominated intercompany loan with a wholly owned subsidiary  for which its functional currency is the pound sterling 
due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  we incurred a million foreign currency transaction loss in january  which was recorded in other expense 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
the tax rate for fiscal was significantly lower due to enhanced tax benefits associated with specific foreign exchange losses and higher r d tax credits 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of four events 
the first event was a million benefit as a result of the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions mainly associated with losses on disposition of assets 
this release of tax reserves resulted from the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the second event was a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities  which was the result of the enactment of tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate 
the third event was a million tax expense related to tax liabilities associated with an examination of the us federal and state income tax returns 
the fourth event was a million reduction of valuation allowances related to net operating losses and foreign tax credits that were generated in prior years 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of five events 
the first event was a million tax benefit for the reduction of previously recorded withholding tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of a us canadian tax treaty 
the second event was a million expense resulting from the reversal of previously recorded tax benefits associated with the implementation of cmc s sadi program 
the third event was a million tax benefit associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s us income tax return to the us income tax provision 
the fourth event was an adjustment that resulted in a reclassification of million of tax benefits from discontinued operations to continued operations offset by a million tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for us foreign tax credits that are not expected to result in a current or future reduction in us income taxes 
the fifth event was a million tax expense associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s foreign income tax returns to the foreign income tax provisions 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and are as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders increased at our avionics controls and advanced materials and declined at sensors systems due to the downturn in commercial aviation 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal totaled million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
net working capital decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of the prior year 
sources of cash flows from operating activities principally consist of cash received from the sale of products offset by cash payments for material  labor and operating expenses 
cash flows from operating activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase principally reflected higher cash collections from customers  lower cash payments for income taxes  and partially offset by higher cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and payments for inventory and interest 
cash flows used by investing activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal principally reflected the use of cash for acquisition of businesses of million and capital assets of million 
cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal principally reflected the use of cash for capital assets of million  partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of pressure systems  inc of million

capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively excluding acquisitions and included facilities  machinery  equipment and enhancements to information technology systems 
capital expenditures for fiscal included million under a capitalized lease obligation related to a new facility for an avionics controls operation and a facility expansion for an interface technologies facility 
capital expenditures are anticipated to approximate million for fiscal we will continue to support expansion through investments in infrastructure including machinery  equipment  and information systems 
acquisitions on december   the company acquired eclipse electronic systems  inc eclipse for million 
eclipse is a designer and manufacturer of embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications 
eclipse is included in our avionics controls segment 
on july   the company acquired the souriau group souriau for approximately million  net of acquired cash 
souriau is a leading global supplier of highly engineered connection technologies for harsh environments 
souriau is included in our sensors systems segment 
debt financing total debt increased million from the prior year to approximately billion at the end of fiscal total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal consisted of million senior notes due in  million of senior notes due in  million million under our euro term loan  million in borrowings under our secured credit facility  million under capital lease obligations and million in various foreign currency debt agreements and other debt agreements 
in march  we entered into a secured credit facility for million made available through a group of banks 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and interest is based on standard inter bank offering rates 
the interest rate will range from libor plus to libor plus depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   we had million outstanding under the secured credit facility at an initial interest rate of libor plus or 
in july  we amended the secured credit facility to provide for a new million term loan euro term loan 
the interest rate on the euro term loan will range from euro libor plus to euro libor plus depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   the company had million outstanding or million under the euro term loan at an interest rate of euro libor plus or 
the loan amortizes at of the original principal balance quarterly through march  with the remaining balance due in july on august   the company issued million in senior notes due requiring semi annual interest payments in march and september of each year until maturity 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes  after deducting million of debt issuance cost  were million 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to august   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
in addition  before august   the company may redeem up to of the principal amount at plus accrued interest with proceeds of one or more public equity offerings 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after august   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning august   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after august  the company also has million outstanding of senior notes due in  with an interest rate of 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to march   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after march   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning march   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after march  we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal current conditions in the capital markets are uncertain  however  we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
permanent investment of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries our non us subsidiaries had million in cash and cash equivalents at october  cash and cash equivalents at our us parent and subsidiaries aggregated million of october   and cash flow from these operations is sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and debt repayments of our domestic operations 
the earnings of our non us subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely invested  and  accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practical to determine because of the complexities regarding the calculation of unremitted earnings and the potential for tax credits 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline and non us plans maintained by cmc 
our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements for the plans maintained by esterline and cmc to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type and  accordingly  believe a and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate for the esterline and cmc plan  respectively 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our esterline pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we made the following assumptions with respect to our cmc pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our esterline post retirement obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate we made the following assumptions with respect to our cmc post retirement obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate the assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on our post retirement benefit obligations 
our health care trend rate was based on the experience of our plan and expectations for the future 
a basis points increase in the health care trend rate would increase our post retirement benefit obligation by million at october  a basis points decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease our post retirement benefit obligation by million at october  assuming all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal post retirement benefit expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in the health care trend rate would not have a material effect on our post retirement benefit expense 
research and development expense for the three years ended october   research and development expense has averaged of sales 
we estimate that research and development expense in fiscal will be about of sales for the full year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of fiscal year end 
liabilities for income taxes were excluded from the table  as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt credit facilities interest obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations seasonality the timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers and  as a result  we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year 
moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters 
disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our debt includes fixed rate and variable rate obligations at october  we are not subject to interest rate risk on the fixed rate obligations

currency risks we own significant operations in canada  france and the united kingdom 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
furthermore  we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies 
at october   we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk us dollar denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  and certain forward contracts  which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro decreased to at october   from at october   the dollar relative to the uk pound decreased to from  and the dollar relative to the canadian dollar decreased to from 
foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets and forward contracts resulted in a million gain in fiscal  a million gain in fiscal  and a million loss in fiscal the million gain in fiscal included a million gain due to our holding euros to fund the souriau acquisition 
the million loss in fiscal was principally due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the racal acoustics acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  resulting in a million foreign currency transaction loss in january our policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions using forward exchange contracts with maturities up to months 
the company does not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes 
at october   and october   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and million  respectively 
the net fair value of these contracts was a million asset and an million asset at october   and october   respectively 
if the us dollar increased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be an increase of million 
if the us dollar decreased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be a decrease of million

contract rate total fair value at the company had no derivative contracts maturing after fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories at the lower of cost or market  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
when change orders have been approved by both the company and the customer for both scope and price and realization is deemed probable  the original contract price is adjusted and revenues are recognized on contract performance as determined by the achievement of contractual milestones and the cost to cost method 
for partially approved change orders  costs attributable to unpriced change orders are treated as costs of the contract performance in the period the costs are incurred 
claims are also recognized as contract revenue when approved by both the company and the customer  based on contract performance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory cost adjustments 
inventory cost adjustments are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated billion of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we performed our impairment review for fiscal as of july   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our reporting units 
during fiscal  management determined that the trade name useful life was no longer indefinite as a result of further integration of advanced sensors units and promotion of the advanced sensors brand name 
an impairment test was required to be performed to value the trade name at fair value  which resulted in the impairment charge of million 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
we used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our annual impairment test 
we believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
the fair value of all our reporting units exceeds its book value by greater than 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in any of our reporting units to be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the first step step one of an impairment test of long lived assets is to determine the amount of future undiscounted cash flow of the long lived asset 
in the event the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset  a second step is required step two  and the long lived asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
we performed a step one impairment test of property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million at our non us flare countermeasure operation 
our non us flare countermeasure operation incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal we determined that the undiscounted future cash flow of the business was significantly in excess of the book value of property  plant and equipment  and accordingly  no step two impairment test was required 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date 
we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended guidance related to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of and does not expect a significant impact to the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci  requiring presentation of comprehensive income in either a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or on separate but consecutive statements  the statement of operations and the statement of oci 
the amendment is effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows and will only impact the presentation of oci on the financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended the guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure 
the amended guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the amendment is effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal  with early adoption prohibited 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to materially affect the company s financial statements
