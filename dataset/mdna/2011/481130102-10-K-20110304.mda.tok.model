over the past few years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have deteriorated significantly 
retail and classified run of press rop advertising have decreased from historic levels due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment  automotive and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet and other advertising forms 
circulation declines and online competition have also negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
additionally  the continued housing market downturn has adversely impacted the newspaper industry  including real estate classified advertising as well as the home improvement  furniture and financial services advertising categories 
however  we believe the rate of deterioration of these fundamentals has moderated based on our results for in  our publishing businesses continued to be impacted by the uneven economic recovery and the secular and cyclical influences affecting the newspaper industry 
we have seen advertisers reduce their advertising spending in virtually all advertising categories 
in addition  due to the changing mix of revenue categories  frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and planned advertisting rate decreases in order to increase volume  we have seen a decrease in the average rate per inch of advertising 
retail advertising decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in rop and preprint advertising primarily in the communications  finance and insurance  food  home improvement  automotive and department stores advertising categories and the loss of certain advertisers from our total market coverage product our non subscriber product 
classified advertising revenue  primarily in the real estate category  also decreased in compared to national advertising revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in rop advertising in the health services  food and communications advertising categories

table of contents revenue from new printing customers for which we began printing in the second half of operating earnings at our publishing businesses increased million in compared to  primarily due to the reduction in the expense platform to better align with a reduced revenue base 
total expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a decrease of million in total payroll related costs  including a decrease of million in workforce reduction charges  the impact from the decrease in revenue and overall expense reduction initiatives 
revenues in the broadcast industry are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political and issue advertisers and  to a lesser extent  from barter  digital revenues  retransmission fees  network compensation and other revenues 
because television and radio broadcasters rely upon advertising revenue  they are subject to cyclical changes in the economy 
the size of advertisers budgets  which are affected by broad economic trends  affects the radio industry in general and the revenue of individual television stations  in particular 
other than the political and issue and automotive categories  our broadcasting business continues to experience an uneven economic recovery across the markets in which we operate due to continued challenges in employment and the housing markets 
our broadcasting business also is affected by audience fragmentation as audiences have an increasing number of options to access news and other programming 
television advertising revenue and rates in even numbered years  such as  typically benefit from political and issue advertising because there tends to be more pressure on available inventory as the demand for advertising increases and we have the opportunity to increase average unit rates we charge our customers 
revenue from our broadcasting businesses increased million in compared to primarily due to a million increase in political and issue advertising revenue  a million increase in national advertising revenue primarily due to an increase in automotive advertising revenue  a million increase in olympic advertising revenue  a million increase in local advertising revenue and a million increase in retransmission revenue 
operating earnings from our broadcasting business increased million in compared to  primarily due to the impact from the increase in advertising revenue and the decrease in expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to recording a million non cash broadcast license impairment charge in advertising revenue at our publishing and broadcasting businesses reflects continued cautious behavior of both our customers and consumers 
while we are seeing some improvement at our broadcasting businesses  persistent high unemployment  lack of strong economic growth and continued economic uncertainty temper our optimism with respect to improved revenue in the near term 
revenue levels in our broadcasting business will continue to be affected by increased competition for audiences 
we do not expect that revenues at our daily newspaper will return to revenue levels reported in or prior years given the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
in  we will seek in market growth opportunities in traditional or digital media  make capital investments in our businesses which we expect to increase revenue  and look for new market broadcast acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy will be subject to our ability to identify strategic acquisition candidates  negotiate definitive agreements on acceptable terms and  as necessary  secure additional financing

the retail advertising revenue decreases were in the communications  finance and insurance  food  home improvement  automotive  department stores  airline and travel and furniture categories  partially offset by increases in the health services  real estate and business services categories 
classified advertising revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in the real estate category 
circulation revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in the number of daily and sunday copies sold for home delivery and daily copies sold at single copy outlets at our daily newspaper 
partially offsetting these revenue decreases was a increase in commercial printing revenue at our daily newspaper in compared to we believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income 
secular changes affecting the newspaper industry also are resulting in the need to continue to reduce costs and align our cost structure in the face of continued decreasing revenues 
at our broadcasting businesses  advertising revenue increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in political and issue advertising revenue  an increase in national advertising revenue  an increase in olympic advertising revenue  an increase in local advertising revenue and an increase in retransmission revenue 
the increase in political and issue advertising revenue and olympic advertising revenue is part of the normal two year advertising cycle which affects our television stations in particular 
automotive advertising increased million  or  in compared to primarily at our television stations 
the decrease in total operating costs and expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll related costs reflecting the savings from workforce reduction initiatives implemented in  a decrease in costs related to the decrease in revenue at our publishing businesses  a decrease in workforce reduction charges  a decrease in syndicated and barter programming expenses and a smaller gain related to insurance proceeds from our tower replacement in wichita  kansas 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation due to the increase in operating earnings  and increase in advertising expenses and an increase in commission expense due to the increase in revenue  partially offset by decreases in payroll related costs reflecting the savings from the workforce reduction initiatives  a decrease in bad debt expense  a decrease in legal expenses and overall cost reduction initiatives

ebitda in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in which included a million non cash broadcast license impairment charge 
we define ebitda as net earnings loss excluding gain loss from discontinued operations  net  provision benefit for income taxes  total other expense  net which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization 
management primarily uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions 
we believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management  helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
ebitda is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net earnings to ebitda for and dollars in millions net earnings gain loss from discontinued operations  net provision for income taxes total other expense  net which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense depreciation amortization ebitda the increase in our ebitda is consistent with the increases in our operating earnings for the reasons described above

in the early part of the fourth quarter of  we re launched our total market coverage product which was transitioned from mail delivery to carrier delivery in as a mail based product aimed at recapturing and growing market share 
we believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income and advertisers are still decreasing their spending in traditional print products  including our daily newspaper 
the same trends persisted in our community newspapers and shoppers business 
the million decrease in revenue at our community newspapers and shoppers was primarily due to decreases in automotive  retail and real estate advertising and a decrease from publications we closed or sold

the lack of automotive advertising had a negative impact on the average unit rate we charge our advertisers 
national automotive revenue is heavily placed in prime time  which helps drive average unit rates among other advertisers 
when that placement doesn t occur in prime time  it negatively affects demand and does not allow us the opportunity to increase the rates we can charge our advertisers even when the sell out levels are high

on october   our board of directors approved an amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan to permanently suspend the plan and permanently cease all benefit accruals under the plan effective january  for all active participants  except for any employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires us to bargain over the permanent suspension of the plan accruals 
we also permanently suspended the unfunded non qualified plan that provided additional benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the pension plan and k plan were restricted due to limitations imposed by the internal revenue service 
for employees not covered by the qualified defined benefit pension plan  the k plan was also amended on october  the annual employer contribution will no longer be a component of the k plan effective january  in addition  effective january   the current matching contribution to our k plan has been enhanced

our secured credit facility with extending lenders expires on december  the commitments of the non extending lenders expire on june  since august   there has been no outstanding principal amount of revolving loans drawn under the commitments maturing on june  based on actuarial estimates  we expect to make contributions of million to the qualified pension plan over a ten year period 
if actual results differ from the estimates used  the amount of contributions to the qualified pension plan would likely change 
as of december   we expect to make payments over a ten year period for the non qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan of million and million  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenues or expenses 
we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations 
table of contents to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
an evaluation of impairment of our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles was performed in a decision was made to consolidate the radio and television operations in omaha  nebraska and sell one of the buildings 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of property at our broadcasting business 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment in the future 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
the interim and annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses in accordance with the fasb s guidance for goodwill and intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discreet financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we have three reporting units and we have allocated goodwill to two of them as of september   the date of our annual impairment test 
for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determined fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows were then discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value was estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach was based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach was weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of each reporting unit 
we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information  which are unobservable level inputs per the fasb s fair value hierarchy and which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our total company and our reporting units requires inputs and assumptions ie market growth  operating profit margins  and discount rates that reflect current 
table of contents market conditions as well as management judgment 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of those inputs and assumptions 
if expected cash flows of our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit continues to deteriorate and management concludes expected cash flows will not improve within a reasonable period of time  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used an income approach to estimate fair value 
the fair value estimates of our broadcast licenses contain significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market with the type of signal that each subject station produces 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market  including market population  household income and retail sales  market share and profit margins of an average station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 
we deduct broadcast licenses and tax deductible goodwill over a period of years from the date of acquisition 
the non cash goodwill and broadcast license impairment charges recorded during and the non cash broadcast license impairment charge recorded in are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and have caused us to recognize deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a tax benefit for our of our deferred tax assets and we believe that they will be utilized to offset future taxable income over the next years in accordance with current income tax law 
in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we have future operating losses or reductions in our expected future profitability which would cause us to believe we would be unable to utilize them 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 

table of contents there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in effect on pension benefit obligation as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserved the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
the discount rate and medical cost inflation assumptions could have a significant effect on our other postretirement benefits obligations 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of december  
table of contents new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued amended guidance for goodwill 
the guidance requires entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step one of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the guidance modifies step one so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with no early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued amended guidance for business combinations 
the guidance requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the material business combination s on an individual or aggregate basis that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance for business combination in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements
