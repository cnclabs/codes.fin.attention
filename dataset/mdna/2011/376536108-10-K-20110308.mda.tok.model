item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation law of the state of maryland on february   primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate that we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which are corporations that do not have publicly rated debt 
we have historically entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years and built in rental rate increases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
at december   we owned properties totaling approximately million square feet 
the total gross investment in these properties was approximately million at december  business environment the united states is beginning to recover from the recession that it entered into during late  though it continues to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions in its financial and capital markets 
unemployment remains high and housing starts are low  and these key economic indicators will need to improve in order for the economy to fully recover 
as a result  conditions within the us capital markets generally  and the us real estate capital markets particularly  continue to experience significant dislocation and stress 
while we are seeing signs of stabilization in both the equity and debt capital markets  these markets remain challenging and we do not know if adverse conditions will again intensify  nor are we able to gauge the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
we believe that it will take some time for the united states to fully recover from the recession 
as a result  the continued challenging economic conditions could still materially and adversely impact the financial condition of one or more of our tenants and  therefore  could increase the likelihood that a tenant may declare bankruptcy or default upon its payment obligations arising under a related lease 
moreover  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon our ability to procure external financing 
our principal sources of external financing generally include the issuance of equity securities  long term mortgages secured by properties  and borrowings under our line of credit 
the market for long term mortgages has been limited  as the collateralized mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  market has experienced significant disruption 
with the stresses upon the cmbs market  many banks are not lending on industrial and commercial real estate as they are no longer able to sell these loans to the cmbs market and are not willing or able to keep these loans on their balance sheets 
in addition  many banks have significantly curtailed their general lending practices  as they are having difficulty valuing the underlying real estate in this market 
we are  however  beginning to see banks that are willing to issue medium term mortgages  between two and five years  on substantially less favorable terms than were previously available 
consequently  we continue to focus on using medium term mortgages to finance our real estate activities until the market for long term mortgages returns 

table of contents recent developments investment activities on april   we originated a mortgage loan in the amount of million that was collateralized by an office building located in mclean  virginia in which gladstone management corporation  or our adviser  and gladstone administration llc  or our administrator  are subtenants 
the mortgage loan was originally set to mature in may  though  on july   it was fully repaid 
we received million of additional income and prepayment fees in connection with the early payment and the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our line of credit 
during the year ended december   we acquired one property 
the property is a  square foot office industrial building located in orange city  iowa for approximately million  including related acquisition expenses 
we funded this acquisition through a combination of borrowings from the new line of credit and the assumption of approximately million of mortgage debt on the property 
at closing  the seller assigned to us the existing triple net lease with staples contract commercial  inc  the commercial delivery and fulfillment division of staples  inc the existing triple net lease has a remaining term of approximately sixteen years  and the mortgage debt related to the property matures in december the existing triple net lease provides for aggregate rents of approximately million in with prescribed annual rental rate escalations commencing in financing activities in december  we procured a new line of credit  or the new line of credit  with capital one  na serving as a revolving lender  a letter of credit issuer and as an administrative agent and branch banking and trust company serving as a revolving lender and a letter of credit issuer  which matures on december  the new line of credit replaced our prior million senior secured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature on december   or the prior line of credit 
the new line of credit provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million  with a standby letter of credit sublimit of up to million 
the new line of credit is subject to a maximum borrowing base calculation which may  from time to time  affect the maximum amount available to be drawn 
the new line of credit may  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  be expanded up to million 
in connection with procuring the new line of credit  we repaid the million outstanding balance of the prior line of credit with funds drawn from the new line of credit and with existing cash 
we incurred no early termination penalties or fees in connection with the repayment of outstanding balance of the prior line of credit 
there was million outstanding under the line at december   and we had an available borrowing capacity of million thereunder at december  debt activities we had million of balloon principal payments maturing under one of our long term mortgages in  however  the mortgage has three annual extension options through  and we exercised one of these options on september  in connection with the exercise of the option  the interest rate reset from to 
at the time of notification of extension  we remitted a fee of of the outstanding principal balance  or  and a certification to the lender that our aggregate debt service coverage ratio is not less than the interest rate for the two additional extension periods will adjust based upon the year swap rate at the time of extension and a fixed spread of and  respectively 
we expect to exercise our remaining two annual extension options as they come due in and we have no other balloon principal payments due under any of our mortgages until 
table of contents equity activities we raised approximately million in net proceeds during under our open market sale agreement  or the open market sale agreement  with jefferies company  inc  or jefferies 
under this agreement we may  from time to time  offer to sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to million on the open market through jefferies  as agent  or to jefferies  as principal based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions that we may impose

the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our prior line of credit and fund the acquisition of the property in orange city  iowa 
on november   we entered into a dealer manager agreement  or the dealer manager agreement  as amended and restated on december   with halcyon capital markets  llc  or halcyon  pursuant to which halcyon agreed to act as our dealer manager in connection with our continuous private offering of up to  shares of our then newly designated unregistered senior common stock at per share 
holders of the unregistered senior common stock have the right  but not the obligation  following the fifth anniversary of the issuance of such shares  to exchange any or all of such shares of senior common stock for shares of our common stock 
on october   we terminated the private offering of unregistered senior common stock  including the dividend reinvestment plan for the senior common stock 
in connection with the termination  we wrote off approximately million of fees incurred in relation to the offering 
the expenses consisted primarily of legal  accounting and fees paid to halcyon  and are recorded as professional fees in our consolidated statement of operations

net proceeds from these sales  after selling commissions and dealer manager fees  were approximately  on february   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
subsequently  on february   we sold an additional  shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option

in the future  our adviser may provide investment advisory services to other funds  both public and private  of which it is the sponsor 
advisory and administration agreements we are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our adviser and our administrator 
our adviser and administrator employ all of our personnel and pay their payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
we have an advisory agreement with our adviser  or the advisory agreement  and an administration agreement with our administrator  or the administration agreement 
under the terms of the advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  stockholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
during the years ended december   and  none of these third party expenses were incurred by us directly 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties that we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans that we make 
table of contents and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
management services and fees under the advisory agreement the advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  or total common stockholders equity  and for an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo 
our adviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties as is common with other externally advised reits 
furthermore  there are no fees charged when our adviser secures long or short term credit or arranges mortgage loans on our properties  however  our adviser may earn fee income from our borrowers or tenants or other sources 
this fee income earned by our adviser  or a portion thereof  may  at the sole discretion of the board of directors  be credited against our base management fee as a rebate to the base management fee 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any distributions paid on preferred stock and senior common stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee would reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee  or pre incentive fee ffo  exceeds  or the hurdle rate  of total common stockholders equity 
we pay our adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre incentive fee ffo in each calendar quarter as follows no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre incentive fee ffo does not exceed the hurdle rate of annualized  of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized  and of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized 
quarterly incentive fee based on ffo pre incentive fee ffo expressed as a percentage of total common stockholders equity graphic percentage of pre incentive fee ffo allocated to incentive fee the incentive fee may be reduced because of a covenant which exists in our line of credit agreement which limits distributions to our stockholders to of ffo 
in order to comply with this covenant  our board of directors accepted our adviser s offer to unconditionally  irrevocably and voluntarily waive on a quarterly basis a portion of the incentive fee for the years ended december   and  which allowed us to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders 
these waived fees may not be recouped by our adviser in the future 
our adviser has indicated that it intends to continue to waive all or a portion of the incentive fee in order to support the current level of distributions to our stockholders  however  our adviser is not required to issue any such waiver  either in whole or in part 

table of contents administration agreement pursuant to the administration agreement  we pay for our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us  including  but not limited to  rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  internal counsel  treasurer  investor relations and their respective staffs 
our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions 
management relies on its experience  collects historical and current market data  and analyzes this information in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
a summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
below is a summary of accounting polices involving estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective or significant judgments in their application and that materially affect our results of operations 
allocation of purchase price when we acquire real estate  we allocate the purchase price  less any expenses related to the acquisition  to i the acquired tangible assets and liabilities  consisting of land  building  tenant improvements  long term debt and ii the identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  the value of unamortized lease origination costs  the value of tenant relationships and the value of capital lease obligations  based in each case on their fair values 
all expenses related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized into the cost of the acquisition as had been required by the previous accounting 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods  which primarily range from to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
management also considers the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and management s expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
a change in any of the assumptions above  which are very subjective  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet  the amounts allocated to the value of above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense 
thus  depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets  changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our ffo  a metric which is used by many reit investors to evaluate our operating performance  and the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly  and thus  changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases  which normally range from to years 
also  we depreciate our buildings over years  but do not depreciate our land 
these differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment evaluation we periodically review the carrying value of each property to determine if circumstances that indicate impairment in the carrying value of the investment exist or that depreciation periods should be modified 
in determining if impairment exists  management considers such factors as our tenants payment history  the financial condition of our tenants  including calculating the current leverage ratios of tenants  the likelihood of lease renewal  business conditions in the industry in which our tenants operate and whether the carrying value of our real estate has decreased 
if any of the factors above support the possibility of impairment  we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific property and determine if the carrying amount in such property is recoverable 
in preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows  we estimate the holding periods of the properties and cap rates using information that we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources 
if impairment is indicated  the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property s discounted future cash flows using assumptions from market participants 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations  as the changes would impact our determination of whether impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss that we would recognize 
using the methodology discussed above and in light of the current economic conditions discussed above in overview business environment  we evaluated our entire portfolio as of december  for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on those select properties that had an indication of impairment 
subsequent to this analysis  we concluded that none of our properties were impaired  and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any indicators that may change our conclusion 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans that we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
management reflects provisions for loan losses based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we had no outstanding mortgage loans receivable as of december  recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of all recently issued accounting pronouncements 

table of contents results of operations our weighted average yield on our occupied portfolio as of december  was approximately 
the weighted average yield on our occupied portfolio is calculated by taking the annualized straight line rents  reflected as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations  or mortgage interest payments  reflected as interest income from mortgage notes receivable on our consolidated statements of operations  of each acquisition or mortgage loan as a percentage of the acquisition or loan price  as applicable 
the weighted average yield does not account for the interest expense incurred on the mortgages placed on our properties

operating expenses depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively flat for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because we only acquired one property in december  which had a minimal impact on the expense 
property operating expenses consist of franchise taxes  management fees  insurance  ground lease payments and overhead expenses paid on behalf of certain of our properties 
property operating expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of overhead  insurance and franchise tax expenses for which we are now responsible at the two properties where our leases expired and the tenants subsequently vacated during due diligence expenses primarily consist of legal fees and fees incurred for third party reports prepared in connection with potential acquisitions and our due diligence analyses related thereto 
due diligence expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of the property in orange city  iowa in december total due diligence expenses remain relatively low  however  with our adoption of accounting standards codification  or asc  business combinations  on january   which requires that we no longer capitalize due diligence costs into the price of an acquisition  we expect that our due diligence expenses will increase significantly in as we intend to acquire more properties 
the base management fee decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to a decrease in total common stockholders equity  the main component of the calculation 
total common stockholders equity decreased because distributions to common stockholders for the year ended december  exceeded net income during the period by approximately million 
the calculation of the base management fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
the incentive fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the increase in pre incentive fee ffo caused by the million of additional income and prepayment fees we received in connection with the early repayment of our mortgage loan  coupled with the decrease in total common stockholders equity 
the calculation of the incentive fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
the administration fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of the total expenses allocated from our administrator during the periods 
the calculation of the administration fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal  consulting and accounting fees  increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the write off of approximately million of fees and expenses incurred in relation to the private offering of unregistered senior common stock and related dividend reinvestment plan  discussed in overview recent

insurance expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of an increase in the premiums for the period from september through september premiums for the period from september through september decreased by approximately  thus we anticipate a decrease in insurance expenses in directors fees remained relatively flat for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as we made no changes to the compensation paid to our non employee directors for general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of decreased costs associated with printing and filing our proxy materials and annual report in other income and expense interest income from temporary investments decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of lower interest rates earned on our money market accounts  coupled with interest received during from funds held on deposit for a prospective real estate acquisition 
interest income on employee loans decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was a result of loan payoffs made by employees during and  coupled with other principal repayments during other income increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of the million in additional income and prepayment fees we received in connection with the early repayment of our mortgage loan in july interest expense decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of the approximately decrease in the interest rate charged on our million mortgage loan that was renewed in september  coupled with a decrease in the london interbank offered rate  or libor  from  which reduced our interest expense under our line of credit and reduced interest expense on our long term financings from amortizing principal payments made during and discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  relates to the property that we sold in july  which was located in norfolk  virginia 

table of contents net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily because of the million in additional income and prepayment fees we received in connection with the early repayment of our mortgage loan in july  partially offset by the write off of million in fees related to the termination of our private offering of unregistered senior common stock

insurance expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of an increase in the premiums for the periods from september through september and from september through september directors fees decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of one of the independent directors becoming an interested director in january  and thus not being paid an annual stipend during general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of decreased costs associated with printing and filing our proxy materials 
other income and expense interest income from temporary investments decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of lower interest rates earned on our money market accounts  partially offset by interest received in from funds held on deposit for a prospective real estate acquisition  coupled with interest earned on amounts held in reserve accounts with our lenders

interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this was primarily a result of long term financings  which closed during  that were held for the full period during discontinued operations income from discontinued operations primarily relates to the property we sold  which was located in norfolk  virginia  including a gain on the sale of the property of approximately  this is partially offset by continuing expenses related to the two canadian properties  which we sold in july the expenses for the two canadian properties relate to legal fees associated with the dissolution of the entities  which sold the properties 
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest expense from the increased number of properties which have long term financing partially offset by the gain on sale of our property in norfolk  virginia coupled with the growth of our portfolio of investments in the past year and the corresponding increase in our revenues and the other events described above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources future capital needs overview as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  had an available borrowing capacity of million under our new line of credit and had obtained mortgages on of our properties 
as of december   we had investments in real properties having gross and net carrying values  including intangible assets  of approximately and million  respectively 
as discussed in overview business environment above  although it improved during  the us economy generally  and the equity and debt capital markets specifically  continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions 
because of these capital market conditions  our ability to issue equity securities  obtain additional mortgages and borrow debt proceeds  our three principal sources of external financing  was affected during therefore  we primarily focused upon building the value of our existing portfolio of properties by renegotiating existing leases and making capital improvements to our properties 
equity capital despite the aforementioned economic conditions  the equity capital markets did improve in the latter half of as a result  we were able to raise approximately million pursuant to our open market sales agreement and approximately  pursuant to our continuous private placement of unregistered senior common stock 
in december  we used a portion of these proceeds to finance the acquisition of our property that is located orange city  iowa and the remainder for general corporate and working capital needs 
with the continued improvement of equity capital market conditions  we were able to raise approximately million of additional equity capital in february see overview recent events above 
we used these proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the new line of credit and the remainder for general corporate and working capital needs 
currently  we have the ability to raise up to approximately million of additional equity and debt capital through the sale of securities that are registered under our universal shelf registration statement on form s the universal shelf in one or more future public offerings 
of the approximately million of available capacity under our universal shelf  approximately million of common stock is reserved for sale under our open market sale agreement 
debt capital despite the disruptions in the cmbs market discussed in overview business environment above  we believe that banks are recommencing their general lending practices 
specifically  we are beginning to see banks that are willing to issue medium term mortgages  between two and five years  on substantially less favorable terms than were previously available 
consequently  we will continue to focus on using medium term mortgages to finance our real estate activities until the market for long term mortgages returns 
as of december   we had obtained approximately million in long term financing which was secured by of our properties 
see mortgage notes payable below for a more detailed discussion of our mortgage notes payable 
on april   we originated a mortgage loan in the amount of million that was collateralized by an office building located in mclean  virginia in which our adviser  and our administrator  are subtenants 
the mortgage loan was originally set to mature in may  though  on july   it was fully repaid 
we received million of additional income and prepayment fees in connection with the early payment and the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our prior line of credit 
in the future  we intend to expand our mortgage lending activity to by generating additional mortgage loans and purchasing mortgage loans from lenders  banks and cmbs pools 
as of december   we had no mortgage loans outstanding 

table of contents in december  we procured our new line of credit which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million with a standby letter of credit sublimit of up to million 
the new line of credit replaced our prior line of credit which was scheduled to mature on december  upon procuring the new line of credit  we repaid the million outstanding balance of the prior line of credit with funds drawn from the new line of credit and with existing cash proceeds 
we incurred no early termination penalties or fees in connection with the repayment of outstanding balance of the prior line of credit 
as of december   we had an outstanding principal balance of million under the new line of credit at an interest rate of approximately  and we had remaining borrowing capacity of approximately million 
see line of credit below for a more detailed discussion of our prior line of credit and new line of credit 
future capital needs we actively seek conservative investments that are likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
if we are able to raise  procure or borrow additional equity and debt capital  we would intend to use the proceeds to continue to invest in industrial and commercial real property as well as expand our investment portfolio into other real property sectors  such as retail and medical properties  make mortgage loans  repurchase shares of our preferred stock on the open market or pay down outstanding borrowings under our new line of credit 
accordingly  to ensure that we are able to effectively execute our business strategy  we routinely review our liquidity requirements and continually evaluate all potential sources of liquidity 
our short term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to fund our distributions to stockholders  pay the debt services costs on our existing long term mortgages  and fund our current operating costs 
our long term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to grow and maintain our portfolio of investments 
we believe that our current cash flows from operations  coupled with borrowings from our new line of credit  are sufficient to fund our distributions to stockholders  pay the debt service costs on our existing long term mortgages and fund our current operating costs in the near term 
we further believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with the potential financing capital available to us in the future are sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs 
additionally  to satisfy either our short term or long term obligations or both  we may require credits to our management fees that are issued from our adviser although our adviser is under no obligation to provide any such credits  either in whole or in part 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of the additional income and prepayment fees that we received in connection with the early repayment of our mortgage loan in july coupled with reduced interest expense  partially offset by the increase in the net incentive fee  administration fee and property operating expenses 
the majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments that we receive from our tenants 
we utilize this cash to fund our property level operating expenses and use the excess cash primarily for debt and interest payments on our mortgage notes payable  interest payments on our line of credit  distributions to our stockholders  management fees to our adviser  and other entity level expenses 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of the repayment of our million mortgage loan  partially offset by the acquisition of our property located in orange city  iowa  net payments to our lenders for reserves and tenant improvements performed at certain of our properties  as compared to net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  of approximately  which primarily consisted of tenant improvements performed at our property located in maple heights  ohio and net payments to lenders for reserves and leasing commissions paid related to the extension of the lease for our property 
table of contents located in eatontown  new jersey  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our property located in norfolk  virginia 
we have had limited acquisition activity since because of the lack of access to capital as discussed in overview business environment above  which has resulted in a significant decrease in the cash used in investing activities 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of distributions paid to our stockholders  principal repayments on mortgage notes payable  payments for deferred financing costs and net repayments on our line of credit  partially offset by proceeds from sales of common and senior common stock 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of repayment of our short term loan  principal repayments on mortgage notes payable and distributions paid to our stockholders  partially offset by net borrowings from our line of credit 
mortgage notes payable as of december   we had fixed rate mortgage notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million  collateralized by a total of properties with terms at issuance ranging from years to years 
the weighted average interest rate on the mortgage notes payable as of december  was approximately as discussed in overview recent events above  we had million of balloon principal payments maturing under one of our long term mortgages in  however  the mortgage has three annual extension options through  and we exercised one of these options on september  in connection with the exercise of the option  the interest rate reset from to through september  at the time of notification of extension  we remitted a fee of of the outstanding principal balance  or approximately  and a certification to the lender that our aggregate debt service coverage ratio was not less than the interest rate for the two additional extension periods will adjust based upon the year swap rate at the time of extension and a fixed spread of and  respectively 
we have no other balloon principal payments due under any of our mortgages until line of credit in december  we procured a new million line of credit  or the new line of credit  with capital one  na serving as a revolving lender  a letter of credit issuer and as an administrative agent and branch banking and trust company serving as a revolving lender and a letter of credit issuer  which matures on december  the new line of credit replaced our prior million senior secured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature on december   or the prior line of credit 
the new line of credit provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million  with a standby letter of credit sublimit of up to million 
the new line of credit is subject to a maximum borrowing base calculation which may  from time to time  affect the maximum amount available to be drawn 
the new line of credit may  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  be expanded up to million 
currently  eight of our properties are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the new line of credit is equal to the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin of up to depending upon our leverage 
our leverage ratio used in determining the applicable margin for interest on the new credit line is recalculated quarterly 
we will be subject to an annual maintenance fee of per year 
our ability to access this source of financing is subject to our continued ability to meet customary lending requirements such as compliance with financial and operating covenants and our meeting certain lending limits 
one such covenant requires us to limit distributions to our stockholders to of our ffo  with acquisition related costs required to be expensed under asc added back to ffo 
in addition  the maximum amount that we may draw under this agreement is based on a percentage of the value of properties pledged as collateral to the banks  which must meet agreed upon eligibility standards 
the maximum amount that we may currently draw under the new line of credit is approximately million 
furthermore  those eight properties that are pledged as collateral to the banks are pledged through a perfected first priority lien in the equity interest of the special 
table of contents purpose entity  or spe  that owns the property 
in addition  our operating partnership owns the spes  and our operating partnership is precluded from transferring the spes or unconsolidated affiliates to us 
if and when long term mortgages are arranged for these pledged properties  the banks will release the properties from the line of credit and reduce the availability under the line of credit by the advanced amount of the released property 
conversely  as we purchase new properties meeting the eligibility standards  we may pledge these new properties to obtain additional advances under this agreement 
the availability under the line of credit will also be reduced by letters of credit used in the ordinary course of business 
we may use the advances under the line of credit for both general corporate purposes and the acquisition of new investments 
at december   there was million outstanding under the line of credit at an interest rate of approximately and approximately million outstanding under letters of credit at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
at december   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the line of credit was approximately million 
our ability to increase the availability under our line of credit is dependent upon our pledging additional properties as collateral 
traditionally  we have pledged new properties to the line of credit as we arrange for long term mortgages for these pledged properties 
currently  only nine of our properties do not have long term mortgages  and eight of those are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
accordingly  we have only one property which is unencumbered  and which may be pledged as collateral to increase the borrowing capacity available under the line of credit 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the new line of credit as of december  
table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects our material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations interest on debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total debt obligations represent borrowings under our line of credit  which represents million of the debt obligation due in  and mortgage notes payable that were outstanding as of december  the million mortgage note issued in september matures in october  and we expect to exercise each of our options to extend the maturity date until october interest on debt obligations includes estimated interest on our borrowings under our line of credit 
the balance and interest rate on our line of credit is variable  thus  the amount of interest calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of december  capital lease obligations represent the obligation to purchase the land held under the ground lease on our property located in fridley  minnesota 
operating lease obligations represent the ground lease payments due on our tulsa  oklahoma property 
the lease expires in june off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable  these features do not eliminate this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to further manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the year ended december   we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and that no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
the following table summarizes the impact of a  and increase in the one month libor for the year ended december  as of december   our effective average libor was  thus  a decrease could not occur 
increase to rental increase to interest net decrease to interest rate change interest income expense net income increase to libor increase to libor increase to libor as of december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit or long term mortgage debt which we use to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees and borrowers  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
