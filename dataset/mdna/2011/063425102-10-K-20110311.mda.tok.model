item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part ii item of this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
forward looking statements the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in part i captioned forward looking statements and item a captioned risk factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report 
executive summary we reported record annual earnings of million in  an increase of thousand  or from million a year ago 
earnings growth reflects a lower level of credit losses  continued focus on cost controls  and growth in interest earning assets 
our continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships has led to higher deposits  a core funding source for our loan portfolio 
deposit growth in was substantial at million  or  over a year ago without compromising our pricing discipline 
demand deposits grew million or over a year ago and comprised of total deposits at december  diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  totaled  up from in the prior year 
diluted earnings per share were reduced by related to bancorp s participation and withdrawal from the tcpp and related to an fdic special assessment  as discussed later 
we are committed to actively lend with a focus in our local community 
total loans reached million at december   representing an increase of million  or  over december  this growth primarily reflects growth in our san francisco and santa rosa markets and represents an increase in commercial real estate loans  partially offset by decreases in construction and commercial loans 
our focus on prudent lending standards  proactive management of credit risk and discipline in operating within markets that we know have kept our loan losses to a minimal level 
non accrual loans totaled million  or of the bank s loan portfolio at december   compared to million or a year ago 
accruing loans past due to days decreased to thousand at december  from thousand a year ago 
the provision for loan losses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses of million totaled of loans at december  compared to million or at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans reflects a higher level of non performing loans and the related specific reserves 
net charge offs in decreased to million in from million in  and primarily related to construction loans secured by real property where the value of collateral has declined 
net loans charged off in represent of average loans compared to in on march   bancorp repurchased all  shares of outstanding preferred stock issued in december under the tcpp program 
we determined that continued participation in the tcpp was not in the best interest of our common shareholders  customers or our employees  and it would impede our ability to compete after the u 
s government s actions  interpretations  and commentary regarding various aspects of the tcpp program 
the warrant issued to the us treasury to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp after the repurchase of the preferred stock under the tcpp  we continued to grow our capital during and the total risk based capital ratio for bancorp at december  totaled compared to at december   exceeding industry standards for being well capitalized 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was in compared to in decreases in the tax equivalent net interest margin were primarily due to lower yields on investment securities as a result of increased prepayments and lower yields on recent purchases and a shift in the relative composition of interest earning assets from higher yielding loans to lower yielding cash held at the federal reserve bank and other short term investments 
the excess liquidity from deposit inflows has not been deployed fully into higher yielding loans as the banking industry as a whole is experiencing challenges with loan demand from qualified borrowers 
the largest factors likely to affect our net interest margin in will be our ability to generate profitable loans to creditworthy borrowers  as well as our responsiveness to competitive pricing on loans and deposits in our market 
in the current environment of historically low short term interest rates  it is imperative for us to continue to mitigate exposure to potential increases in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  we anticipate that net interest income will rise 
the increase in interest income from asset repricing may be partially offset by deposit rate sensitivity 
additionally  it may take several upward market rate movements for variable rate loans at floors to move above the floor rates 
as such  if interest rates increase by less than basis points  we anticipate little impact on our net interest income 
further  we expect loan demand to continue to be challenging due to the uncertain economic climate and the intensifying competition for creditworthy borrowers  both of which could lead to loan rate concession pressure and could impact our ability to generate profitable loans 
as discussed in note  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of napa based charter oak bank on february  this transaction was completed under a modified whole bank purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic without loss share 
at december   charter oak bank reported gross loans totaling million and deposits totaling million 
the purchase price reflects an asset discount of million and no deposit premium 
loans at the former charter oak bank s book values totaling approximately million as of the bid valuation date october  were retained by the fdic 
the excluded loans mainly represent loans delinquent more than sixty days or more as of the bid valuation date and certain types of land and construction loans 
balances are subject to change based upon the activities between the bid valuation date and the purchase date 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are also subject to fair value adjustments in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations upon finalizing the valuation process 
we have also expanded our community banking footprint into sonoma county 
on october   the bank opened a loan production office in santa rosa  which will be converted to a full service commercial banking office in the second quarter of in addition  in december  the bank signed a lease for a branch in downtown sonoma 
this office is expected to open by mid summer we expect our non interest expenses to continue to increase in as we continue our expansion into sonoma and napa counties 
we expect that these strategic initiatives will contribute to our profitability in the long term 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  share based payment  accounting for income taxes and fair value measurements 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies 
management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing 
for loans that are determined impaired  formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan by loan basis 
our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on an analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category  including consideration of the bank s historical charge off history 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities at each financial statement date  we assess whether declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their costs are deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the instrument and economic factors that are relevant to the collectability of the instrument  such as current prepayment speeds  the current financial condition of the issuer s  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  credit default rates  interest rate trends and the value of any underlying collateral 
credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
non credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
the other than temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income for debt securities classified as held to maturity is accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner on the basis of the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
share based payment we recognize all share based payments  including stock options and non vested restricted common shares  as an expense in the statement of income based on the grant date fair value of the award with a corresponding increase to common stock 
we determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the black scholes pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior and stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of the common stock 
the estimates used in the model involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reflected in these financial statements 
the fair value of non vested restricted common shares generally equals the stock price at grant date 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp accounting for income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach 
we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
bancorp files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  we may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit or least amount of tax expense that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
management believes that all of our tax positions taken meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
to the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other than temporarily impaired 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements 
for detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

table of contents bank of marin bancorp net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on net interest margin 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which include demand deposits and stockholders equity 
table  distribution of average statements of condition and analysis of net interest income  compares interest income and average interest earning assets with interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities for the three years ended december   and the table also indicates net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period presented

yields on available for sale securities are calculated based on amortized cost balances rather than fair value  as changes in fair value are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
average balances on loans outstanding include non performing loans 
the amortized portion of net loan origination fees is included in interest income on loans  representing an adjustment to the yield 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp compared with tax equivalent net interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was due to an increase in volume of interest earning assets  offset by the effect of lower yields on investment securities 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to this included increases in average interest bearing due from banks of million  average investment securities of million and average loan growth of million 
in october  we opened our santa rosa loan production office  which is expected to position the bank for additional loan growth  particularly in commercial and industrial loans 
the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased to in  down twenty two basis points from the decrease in the tax equivalent net interest margin was primarily due to lower yields on investment securities as a result of increased prepayments and lower yields on recent additions and a shift in the relative composition of interest earning assets from higher yielding loans to lower yielding interest bearing due from banks 
the excess liquidity from deposit inflows has not yet been deployed into funding new loans  as the banking industry as a whole is experiencing challenges with loan demand and the competition for qualified borrowers intensified 
the net interest spread decreased nineteen basis points from the same period last year for the same reasons 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to the increases are pervasive in all categories of deposit accounts except money market accounts  with the most significant increase in time deposits including cdars  which increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in overnight borrowings of million 
we have experienced a shift in the relative composition of interest bearing deposits in compared to as the proportion of higher costing time accounts has increased  while the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased 
market interest rates are in part based on the target federal funds interest rate the interest rate banks charge each other for short term borrowings implemented by the federal reserve open market committee 
in december of  the target interest rate was brought to a historic low with a range of to where it remains as of december  the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised and of average earning assets in and  respectively  increased three basis points in compared to this is mainly due to the shift in the mix of loans from construction and commercial loans to higher yielding commercial real estate loans 
interest foregone on non accrual loans represented a seven basis point reduction to the net interest margin in both and the lower yields on investment securities are a result of increased prepayments resulting in accelerated amortization of premiums  and lower yields on recently purchased securities 
the yield on private label cmos  agency securities and municipal bonds decreased basis points  basis points and ten basis points  respectively  in the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased fifteen basis points in compared to  primarily reflecting lower offering rates on money market accounts  as well as the downward re pricing of time deposits as they mature 
in  the rate on other time deposits  cdars  and money market accounts decreased thirty seven basis points  twenty three basis points  and twenty basis points  respectively 
the rate on the subordinated debenture dropped sixty one basis points due to a decline in the three month libor rate  to which the debenture rate is indexed 
compared with the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased to in  down twenty four basis points from the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the repricing of our loan portfolio in a declining rate environment  and to a lesser extent  interest foregone on non accrual loans representing a seven basis point impact on the net interest margin in versus a two basis point effect in 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the net interest rate spread in is consistent with  reflecting a decrease of seventy five basis points in the yield on interest earning assets and a decline of seventy four basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in  there were seven downward adjustments to the target federal funds rate totaling basis points  bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of to 
market rate changes have a more immediate effect on deposit rates than on loan yields due to our fixed rate loans see table below for our fixed vs 
variable loans distribution 
in addition  the large majority of our variable loans are tied to the us treasury constant maturity indices with repricing intervals between one year to five years 
the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised approximately of average earning assets in both and  decreased eighty five basis points in due to the downward repricing of variable rate loans and new loans originated at lower market rates  as well as maturities and pay downs of higher yielding loans 
the yield on agency securities in decreased twenty basis points from  mainly reflecting a tighter spread between agency yields and treasury rates on newly purchased agency securities due to the stabilization of the mbs market in and increased prepayments of higher yielding securities which accelerated the amortization of premiums 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to the increase primarily relates to average loan growth of million and an increase in average investment securities of million  partially offset by a million decline in average federal funds sold 
there was no significant shift in the mix of interest earning assets in the overall cost of liabilities is affected by offered rates and the mix of deposits and other liabilities 
the overall rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased seventy four basis points in over the rate on savings and money market accounts  cdars  and time deposits decreased basis points  basis points  and basis points  respectively  in compared to  reflecting lower offered rates on deposits in response to lower market rates 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to the increases are pervasive in all categories of interest bearing liabilities  most notably in cdars deposits and purchased funds  which increased million and million respectively in late in the first quarter of  we began to offer cdars  a network through which the bank offers fdic insurance coverage in excess of the current thousand regulatory maximum by placing deposits in multiple banks participating in the network 
cdars contributed to an increase in average deposits of million in we experienced a shift in the relative mix of interest bearing liabilities in compared to the proportion of higher costing liabilities mainly cdars and purchased funds has increased from of interest bearing liabilities in to in  while the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased from in to in page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp table  analysis of changes in net interest income  separates the change in net interest income into two components volume change caused by increases or decreases in the average asset and liability balances outstanding  and yield rate changes in average yields on earning assets and average rates for interest bearing liabilities

the unallocated change in rate or volume variance has been allocated between the rate and volume variances on a pro rata basis 
yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
the table indicates that in and  our net interest income was favorably affected by an increase in the volume of interest earning assets  partially offset by declines in yields 
the decline in our asset yields in reflected the lower returns on investment securities discussed previously  while the decline in reflected the downward repricing of our variable loans as their indexed rates reset

page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on several factors including growth of the loan portfolio  analysis of probable losses in the portfolio  recent loss experience and the current economic climate 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance  and the allowance is increased through the provision for loan losses charged to expense to bring the allowance to a level  based on management s best judgment  to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
for further discussion  see the section captioned critical accounting policies 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in  which was relatively unchanged 
see the section captioned allowance for loan losses below for further analysis of the provision for loan losses

the increase in wealth management and trust services wmts income is due to higher estate settlement and trust services fees received in  as well as the increase in assets under management 
as of december  and  assets under management totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in customer banking fees  and other charges  is primarily due to higher visa debit card fees  attributable to a higher volume of visa debit card usage  as well as a bank wide visa debit card promotion program 
as previously discussed in item a risk factors  in december  the federal reserve proposed a new regulation to restrict interchange fees charged for debit card transactions by card issuers over billion in asset size 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of the proposed rule  and its effect on the market pricing of the interchange fees  we can not quantify the ultimate impact of this proposal on our visa debit card fees 
merchant interchange income increased due to the higher transaction volume from our merchant customers as well as one time billing adjustments 
the decrease in other non interest income is mainly due to a decrease in miscellaneous income  partially offset by an increase in the dividend received on federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb stock 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp compared with in  the mandatory redemption of a portion of our shares of visa  inc generated a net gain of thousand as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
excluding this nonrecurring gain  non interest income in increased thousand  or  from the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in was primarily due to the increase in the volume of deposit accounts 
the increase in wmts income in primarily reflected a higher level of assets under management 
the increase in bank owned life insurance boli income in is attributable to the full year s worth of income earned on the million of policies purchased in august the increase in customer banking fees in is primarily due to a k increase in visa debit fees attributable to a higher volume of visa card applications resulting from a promotion  as well as an increase in remote deposit capture fees 
merchant interchange fee income increased thousand in due to lower interchange costs charged by our data processing vendor resulting from the renegotiation of our data processing contract 
the decrease in other income in is primarily due to decreases of thousand of dividends on fhlb stock and the absence of thousand in interest we received in the second quarter of on amended tax returns

the number of average fte totaled and in and  respectively 
in addition  a rise in employee benefit rates contributed to the increase 
the increases in occupancy and equipment expense are mainly due to an increase in rent for our greenbrae branch in its first full year of service in  and also the new santa rosa loan production office  partially offset by cost savings from the relocation of our corte madera branch 
the decrease in fdic insurance is due to the absence of a special assessment totaling thousand in the second quarter of  partially offset by a higher fdic assessment rate and higher deposits 
further  we elected to participate in the fdic transaction account guarantee program  which provided unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts defined by the fdic  on which we paid a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand through the basis point surcharge on non interest bearing transaction accounts over thousand increased to basis points from january to december  at which time the program expired 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp as discussed in section the captioned fdic insurance assessments in item business above  on february   the fdic adopted a new fdic insurance assessment base effective in the second quarter of  which is expected to lower our fdic insurance cost by approximately one third annually 
the increase in data processing expense is due to process re engineering costs  an annual contractual rate increase  as well as the outsourcing of certain trust operations 
the increase in professional service expenses in when compared to is mainly due to higher costs associated with strategic expansion initiatives and investment advisory fees 
advertising expenses decreased  primarily due to a decrease in the usage of traditional print advertising channels as part of the marketing program 
director fees increased due to the director compensation rate increase  partially offset by fewer directors 
the increase in other non interest expense from a year ago was primarily due to a higher provision for losses on off balance sheet commitments due to a higher commitment amount  operational losses  printing and stationery costs  charitable contributions and staff relation costs 
compared with the increase in salaries and benefits in from the prior year primarily reflected annual merit increases  higher personnel costs associated with branch expansion  higher incentive compensation  as well as higher employee insurance 
average fte totaled and during and  respectively 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses in from was primarily related to higher premises rent associated with the new greenbrae branch opened in september and increases for renewed leases  as well as a full year of rent for the mill valley branch opened in june depreciation and amortization increased slightly in and reflected amortization of the recently capitalized leasehold improvements of the greenbrae and mill valley branches  partially offset by the effect of certain assets that became fully depreciated in the increase in fdic insurance in was due to a higher fdic assessment rate which more than doubled from  and higher deposits 
effective april   the fdic adopted a final rule revising its risk based insurance assessment system and effectively increasing the overall assessment rate 
the revised initial base assessment rates for risk category institutions ranged from twelve to sixteen basis points  on an annualized basis 
the fdic also imposed a special deposit insurance assessment of five basis points on all insured institutions total assets minus tier capital at june  in order to replenish the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  we recognized thousand from this special assessment in data processing costs decreased in over as we benefitted from the renegotiation of our contract with our data processing vendor 
the increase in professional services in over was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses relating to the repurchase of preferred shares as well as legal expenses relating to delinquent loans 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other professional fees associated with the discontinuation of a consulting agreement that began in july of and ended in june of the increase in advertising expenses from is primarily due to fees associated with a new public relations firm 
the decrease in director expense in is primarily due to the departure of two directors who retired in may page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp the increase in other expense in over reflected operational losses in the second quarter of as well as the absence of a thousand litigation liability cost reversed in in  other expense included a pre tax non recurring charge of thousand recorded in the fourth quarter for the potential obligation to visa usa in connection with certain litigation indemnifications provided to visa usa by visa member banks 
such amount was reversed in against other expense upon visa inc s initial public offering in as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes we reported a provision for income taxes of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
the effective tax rates were   and for those same periods 
these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
therefore  there are normal fluctuations in the effective rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax 
we have not been subject to an alternative minimum tax amt during these periods 
bancorp and the bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement which provides that income taxes shall be allocated between the parties on a separate entity basis 
the intent of this agreement is that each member of the consolidated group will incur no greater tax liability than it would have incurred on a stand alone basis

table of contents bank of marin bancorp allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are charged off against the allowance 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the remaining losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rates and economic and political environments 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
the components of the allowance for loan losses as stated previously in critical accounting policies  and note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends  and an allowance for changing environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management s ongoing loan grading process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually for impairment by management and specific allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan 
impaired loan balances increased from million at december  to million at december  the specific allowance increased from thousand at december  to million at december  the increase in the specific allowance primarily related to commercial  mobile home and home equity loans awaiting resolution of pending events before a determination can be made as to whether or not the loan should be charged off 
the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio 
this analysis encompasses loan types and economic and business conditions unique to each segment  including the bank s own loss history 
this analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above 
for loans graded substandard and not already evaluated for impairment in the first component analysis above  they are also assigned an allowance factor 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan at every reporting date 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loan types 
at december  and  the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase mainly related to an increased allowance factor for non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  as management recognizes increased inherent risk and concentration in these loans  as well as a factor added for loans graded substandard 
as disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements in item below  loans graded substandard totaled million as of december  the third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends 
the general valuation allowance  including the economic component and unallocated allowance  totaled approximately million at both december  and management proactively evaluates economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after assessing the economic outlook  management did not revise the economic component in due to limited signs of economic recovery and continued financial stress experienced by borrowers in our markets 
the persistently high unemployment rate and restrained spending by consumers and businesses are expected to prevent rapid economic expansion and recovery of housing prices

the economic downturn also appears to have impacted the general public s investment behavior  as evidenced by a national trend of increasing household savings and movement away from higher risk equity investments 
we have experienced a slight shift in the mix of interest bearing deposits in compared to the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased while the proportion of time deposits and non interest bearing deposits have increased slightly 
we believe the shift in relative proportions is due to the low interest rate environment as time deposit accounts generally offer higher interest rates and due to customers seeking safety as cdars deposits are fully insured by the fdic 
no individual customer accounted for more than of deposits

as permitted or required under california law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in  or not opposed to  our best interests  and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations  net of expected insurance recoveries  is minimal 
capital adequacy as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank s capital ratios are above regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized and bancorp s ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes 
the bank s total risk based capital ratio increased from at december   to at december   and bancorp s total risk based capital ratio increased from at december   to at december  the increases in the risk based capital ratio are primarily due to the accumulation of net income in of million 
we expect to maintain strong capital levels 
our potential sources of capital include future earnings and shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the warrant issued under the tcpp to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
the warrant  if exercised  would provide us with million additional tier capital 
we are also positioned to access capital markets  if necessary  for up to million through a shelf registration filed on form s in the fourth quarter of liquidity the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet both loan demand and unexpected deposit withdrawals 
we accomplish this goal by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid assets  and formal lines of credit with the fhlb  frb and correspondent banks that enable us to borrow funds as needed 
our asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of certain directors of the bank  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies 
management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
alco has also developed a contingency plan should liquidity drop unexpectedly below internal requirements 
we obtain funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows  investment security maturities and paydowns  federal funds purchased fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
our primary uses of funds are the origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  withdrawals of deposits  maturity of certificate of deposits  repayment of borrowings and dividends to stockholders 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp we must retain and attract new deposits  which depends upon the variety and effectiveness of our customer account products  service and convenience  and rates paid to customers  as well as our financial strength 
any long term decline in retail deposit funding would adversely impact our liquidity 
management does not anticipate significant reliance on federal funds purchased and fhlb advances in the near future  as our core deposit inflow has provided adequate liquidity to fund our operations 
if we were to rely on federal funds purchased or fhlb advances in the future  we expect to have the ability to post adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the sources of liquidity vary between periods 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  an increase of million over december  the primary sources of funds during included a million net increase in deposits  million in pay downs and maturities of investment securities  and million net cash provided by operating activities 
the primary uses of funds were million for investment securities purchases  and million in loan originations net of principal collections 
the excess liquidity from deposit inflows has not been deployed 
the banking industry  as a whole  is experiencing diminished loan demand from qualified borrowers 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available for sale securities maturing within one year totaled million 
the remainder of the unpledged available for sale securities portfolio of million provides additional liquidity 
these liquid assets equaled of our assets at december   compared to at december   well in excess of our internal liquidity policy 
the increased liquidity at december  was primarily due to deposit growth exceeding loan growth 
we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for our operating  investing and financing needs and our regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management monitors our liquidity position daily  balancing loan funding payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments 
our emphasis on local deposits combined with our equity to assets ratio  provides a very stable funding base 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have substantial additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with correspondent banks 
further  on march   we pledged a certain residential loan portfolio that increased our borrowing capacity with the frb  which totaled million at december  as of december   there is no debt outstanding to correspondent banks or the frb 
we are also a member of the fhlb and have a line of credit secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of essentially all of our financial assets in the amount of million  of which million was available at december  borrowings under the line are limited to eligible collateral 
the interest rates on overnight borrowings with both correspondent banks and the fhlb are determined daily and generally approximate the federal funds target rate 
undisbursed loan commitments  which are not reflected on the consolidated statement of condition  totaled million at december  at rates ranging from to 
this amount included million under commercial lines of credit these commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  million under revolving home equity lines  million under undisbursed construction loans  million under personal and other lines of credit  and a remaining million under standby letters of credit 
these commitments  to the extent used  are expected to be funded primarily through the repayment of existing loans  deposit growth and existing balance sheet liquidity 
over the next twelve months million of time deposits will mature 
we expect these funds to be replaced with new time or savings accounts 
since bancorp is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
under the california financial code  payment of a dividend from the bank to bancorp is restricted to the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or the amount of the bank s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years 
as the bank made a million distribution to bancorp in march in connection with bancorp s repurchase of preferred stock  distributions from the bank to bancorp will be subject to advance regulatory approval for three years beginning in the primary uses of funds for bancorp are stockholder dividends and ordinary operating expenses 
in  after approval by the dfi  the bank paid a million dividend to bancorp  which held million of cash at december  to cover bancorp s operational needs and cash dividends to shareholders for the near future 
management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the bank level to provide dividends to bancorp to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the risk is inherent in our deposit and lending activities 
management  together with alco  has sought to manage rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on our net interest margin 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on the net interest margin 
activities in asset and liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  borrowing  accepting deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset and liability management 
sensitivity of net interest income nii to interest rate changes results from differences in the maturity or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of our assets and liabilities is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits and borrowings 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii in changing interest rate environments 
we use simulation models to forecast nii 
exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the alco and the board of directors 
they utilize interest rate sensitivity simulation models as a tool for achieving these objectives and for developing ways in which to improve profitability 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments  borrowings and deposits 
if potential changes to net equity value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest changes are not within the limits established by the board of directors  management may adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within approved limits 
in the following simulation of nii under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against four interest rate change scenarios  in basis point increments 
as the federal funds target rate at december  was already at its historic low of  it is unlikely that there will be further reductions in the target rate 
therefore  a reduction in rate scenario is not considered in the following table at december  each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
table summarizes the effect on nii due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
table effect of interest rate change on net interest income at december  changes in interest estimated change in nii rates in basis points as percent of nii up up up up the above table estimates the impact of interest rate changes 
the estimated changes are within our policy guidelines established by alco 
the table indicates that at december   we were asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment 
the results shown reflect a lag in the upward re pricing of loans due to loans on floors 
we have mitigated earnings sensitivity somewhat through the procurement of fixed rate borrowings 
as stated previously in the section captioned supervision and regulation included in item business of this report  the dodd frank act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july  although the ultimate impact of this legislation on us has not yet been determined  we do not expect to incur significant interest expense on business transaction accounts immediately when the legislation takes effect in july if we were to pay interest on certain deposits that are currently non interest bearing  causing these deposits to become rate sensitive  we would become less asset sensitive than the model currently indicates 
page 
table of contents bank of marin bancorp from time to time  we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long term fixed rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long term fixed rate loans caused by changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
as with any simulation model or other method of measuring interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the process 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the changes in interest rates on certain categories of either our assets or liabilities may precede or lag changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates and timing of prepayments on loans and investment securities could vary significantly from the assumptions used in the various scenarios 
further  changes in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could produce different results from those presented in the table 
accordingly  the results presented should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
one aspect is the time frame within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates at repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames is called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in each of several periods of time 
another aspect is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of change in market rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are calculated as the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing during various time periods 
table shows our repricing gaps as of december  due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  we do not generally use it in managing interest rate risk 
instead we rely on the more sophisticated simulation model described above as the primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk
