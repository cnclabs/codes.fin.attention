item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january   fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january   and fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january  all references to years in this md a represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
management overview our revenues are primarily derived by selling  implementing and supporting software solutions  clinical content  hardware  healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure access to clinical  administrative and financial data in real time  allowing them to improve the quality  safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare 
we implement the healthcare solutions as stand alone  combined or enterprise wide systems 
cerner millennium software solutions can be managed by our clients or in our data centers via a managed services model 
our fundamental strategy centers on creating organic growth by investing in research and development r d to create solutions and services for the healthcare industry 
this strategy has driven strong growth over the long term  as reflected in five and ten year compound annual revenue growth rates of or more 
this growth has also created an important strategic footprint in healthcare  with cerner solutions licensed by approximately  facilities around the world  including more than  hospitals   physician practices covering more than  physicians  ambulatory facilities  such as laboratories  ambulatory centers  cardiac facilities  radiology clinics and surgery centers  home health facilities  and  retail pharmacies 
selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element of our future revenue growth 
we are also focused on driving growth through market share expansion by strategically aligning with healthcare providers who have not yet selected a supplier and by displacing competitors in healthcare settings that are looking to replace their current healthcare information technology hit partners 
we expect to drive growth through new initiatives and services that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate and expand our reach into healthcare 
examples of these include our careaware healthcare device architecture and devices  cerner healthe employer services  cerner itworks sm services  cerner revworks sm services  physician practice solutions and solutions and services for the pharmaceutical market 
finally  we are focused on selling our solutions and services outside the united states 
many non us markets have a low penetration of hit solutions and their governing bodies are in many cases focused on hit as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower the cost of healthcare 
beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth  we are also focused on earnings growth 
similar to our history of growing revenue  our net earnings have increased at more than compound annual rates over the most recent five and ten year periods 
we believe we can continue driving strong levels of earnings growth and leverage key areas to create operating margin expansion 
the primary areas of opportunity for margin expansion include becoming more efficient at implementing our software by leveraging tools and methodologies we have developed that can reduce the amount of effort required to implement our software  leveraging our investments in r d by entering new markets that do not require significant incremental r d but can contribute significantly to revenue growth  and leveraging our scalable business infrastructure to reduce the rate of increase in general and administrative spending to below our revenue growth rate 

table of contents we are also focused on increasing cash flow by growing earnings  reducing the use of working capital and controlling capital expenditures 
results overview the company delivered strong levels of bookings  revenues  earnings and cash flows in new business bookings revenue in  which reflects the value of executed contracts for software  hardware  professional services and managed services  was billion  which is an increase of compared to billion in our revenues increased to billion compared to billion in the year over year increase in revenue reflects improved economic conditions and demand driven by the stimulus incentives 
as discussed in the healthcare and healthcare it industry under part  item  we believe the hitech incentives and the nation s focus on improving the efficiency and quality of healthcare will create a period of increased hit demand in the united states 
our net earnings increased to million compared to million in diluted earnings per share increased to compared to in the and net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of accounting for stock based compensation using the fair value method to measure and record expense for stock options  pursuant to accounting standards codification asc   stock compensation 
the effect of these expenses reduced the net earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  and the earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively 
the growth in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and continued progress with our margin expansion initiatives  particularly leveraging r d investments and controlling general and administrative expenses 
though our full year operating margin was  compared to in  we achieved our long term goal of operating margins in the third and fourth quarters of over the next few years  we believe we can further expand our operating margins by basis points per year on average 
we had cash collections of receivables of billion in compared to billion in days sales outstanding decreased to days for the fourth quarter compared to days for third quarter and days for the fourth quarter  reflecting our improved cash collections 
operating cash flows for were strong at million compared to million in  with the growth driven by cash collections from clients

these expenses increased to million in from million in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is influenced by many factors  including the amount and timing of our revenues  our cash collections from our clients  and the amount we invest in software development  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  which consist of money market funds  time deposits and bonds with original maturities of less than days and short term investments 
at the end of  we had cash of million  cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  as compared to cash of million  cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at the end of additionally  we maintain a million  multi year revolving credit facility  which provides an unsecured revolving line of credit for working capital purposes 
interest is payable at a rate based on prime or libor plus a spread that varies depending on the net worth ratios maintained 
the agreement provides certain restrictions on our ability to borrow  incur liens  sell assets and pay dividends and contains certain net worth  current ratio and fixed charge coverage covenants  which as of the end of  we were in compliance with 
the current agreement expires on may  as of the end of  we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement  however  we have million of outstanding letters of credit  which reduced our available borrowing capacity to million 
we believe that our present cash position  together with cash generated from operations  short term investments and  if necessary  our available lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during during the second quarter of  fujitsu services limited s fujitsu contract as the prime contractor in the national health service nhs initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the southern region of england was terminated by the nhs 
this had the effect of automatically terminating our subcontract for the project 
we are in dispute with fujitsu regarding fujitsu s obligation to pay the amounts comprised of accounts receivable and contracts receivable related to that subcontract  and we are working with fujitsu to resolve these issues based on processes provided for in the contract 
part of that process requires resolution of disputes between fujitsu and the nhs regarding the contract termination 
during the fourth quarter certain events occurred in the resolution process between fujitsu and the nhs which reduced the likelihood the matter will be resolved in the next months 
therefore we reclassified the receivables  which represented more than of our net receivables  from current assets to other long term assets during the fourth quarter 
the circumstances surrounding these receivables remained unchanged at the end of and represent the significant majority of other long term assets at the end of and while the ultimate collectability of the receivables pursuant to this process is uncertain  management believes that it has valid and equitable grounds for recovery of such amounts and that collection of recorded amounts is probable 
in february and march  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the progressive failure of auctions representing all the auction rate securities held by us 
these conditions persisted through the remainder of and into during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement with the investment firm that sold us the auction rate securities 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we received the right to redeem the securities at par value during a period from mid through mid the settlement was in effect a put like instrument with a fair value generally equal to the difference between the auction rate securities fair value and par value 
at the end of  we held auction rate securities with a par value of million  which approximated fair value  as all outstanding auction rate securities were subsequently called at par value by the issuer in january for a more detailed discussion of the auction rate securities  please refer to note  cash and investments  in the consolidated financial statements

free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure used by management along with gaap results to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business 
the presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation  as a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results and investors should be aware that non gaap measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow may also be different from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
we believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial  operational and economic performance

the effects of inflation on our business during  and were not significant 
recent accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition for non software elements that became effective for us beginning on january  under the new guidance an entity is required to apply the relative selling price allocation method in order to estimate selling price for all units of accounting  including delivered items  when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or acceptable third party evidence tpe does not exist 
in addition  expanded disclosures are required to provide both qualitative and quantitative information about the significant judgments made in applying the guidance and subsequent changes in those judgments that may significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
further  for arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are assessing the adoption of the new guidance and do not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  potential impairments of goodwill and income taxes 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this md a 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue within our multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method 
key factors in our revenue recognition model are our assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of our software whereas implementation services are not  and the length of time it takes for us to achieve the delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software 
if our business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of our software  the period of time over which our licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of our licensed software over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
generally  both milestones are achieved in the quarter the contracts are executed 
if the period of time to achieve our delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software were to lengthen  our milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for our licensed software could materially change 

table of contents we also recognize revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method 
our revenue recognition is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to complete a project which generally can span several years 
we utilize our historical project experience and detailed planning process as a basis for our future estimates to complete current projects 
significant delays in completion of the projects  unforeseen cost increases or penalties could result in significant reductions to revenue and margins on these contracts 
the actual project results can be significantly different from the estimated results 
when adjustments are indentified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate is recognized in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design  which is when we determine that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release  and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years 
we expect that trend to continue in the future 
if we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to  the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
we are amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon our forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs 
historically  use of our software programs by our clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more 
we expect that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the hit market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
fair value measurements we determine fair value measurements used in our consolidated financial statements based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access 

table of contents level valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of the end of  we held investments in money market funds  time deposits  commercial paper and government and corporate bonds 
auction rate securities are debt instruments with long term nominal maturities  for which the interest rates regularly reset every days under an auction system 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of auction rate securities  we historically utilized valuation models that were based on discounted cash flow streams  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation was subject to uncertainties that were difficult to predict 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation  including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated holding periods for the auction rate securities  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates  including the liquidity discount rate  applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of these investments could have been significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
at the end of  we transferred our auction rate securities classified as level to level as all outstanding auction rate securities were subsequently called at par value by the issuer in january a considerable amount of judgment and estimation was applied in the valuation of auction rate securities 
in addition  we also apply judgment in determining whether the marketable securities are other than temporarily impaired 
we typically consider the severity and duration of the decline  future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value 
we assess goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluate impairment indicators at each quarter end 
we assessed our goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
in each respective year  the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by a significant margin 
we used a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing level inputs  to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
goodwill amounted to million and million at the end of and  respectively 
if future  anticipated cash flows from our reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected  our goodwill could be impaired  which could result in significant charges to earnings 
income taxes we make a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income taxes 
these assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate as well as current tax regulations 
accruals are established for estimates of tax effects for certain transactions  business structures and future projected profitability of our businesses based on our interpretation of existing facts and circumstances 
if these assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances  the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure contained herein 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a foreign currency denominated debt instrument to reduce our foreign currency exposure in the uk as of the end of  we designated all of our great britain pound gbp denominated long term debt million gbp as a net investment hedge of our uk operations 
because the borrowing is denominated in pounds  we are exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar usd and the gpb 
we estimate that a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the usd and gbp would have impacted the unrealized loss  net of related income tax effects  of the net investment hedge recognized in other comprehensive income by approximately million
