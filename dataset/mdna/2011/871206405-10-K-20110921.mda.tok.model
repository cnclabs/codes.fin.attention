executive summary we develop and market intelligent bandwidth management solutions for fixed line and mobile network operators worldwide and provide services associated with such products 
our current and prospective customers include domestic and international wireline and wireless network service providers  utility companies  large enterprises  multiple systems operators and government entities collectively referred to as service providers 
our existing bandwidth management portfolio of optical switches  multiservice cross connects and multiservice access platforms serve applications that extend across the network infrastructure  from multiservice access and regional backhaul to the optical core 
we also develop and market a mobile broadband optimization solution designed to help mobile operators reduce congestion in mobile access networks 
we believe our products enable network operators to efficiently and cost effectively provision and manage network capacity to support a wide range of converged services such as voice  video and data 
total revenue for fiscal  which was derived exclusively from our intelligent bandwidth management products and services  was million  a decrease of compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of compared to fiscal our net loss for fiscal was million compared to a net loss for fiscal of million 
on december   the company made a cash distribution to its stockholders of per share of its common stock  par value  amounting to million 
as a result of having an accumulated deficit  the cash distribution has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
we believe the portion of the bandwidth management market that we serve is in long term decline and continues to be challenged by high customer concentration  the project oriented nature of purchasing patterns and customer migration to next generation transmission technologies 
in addition  the current economic climate continues to create uncertainty with regard to the level and timing of capital expenditures by service providers 
with purchasing power concentrated in a small number of customers and with an excess of suppliers  competition remains intense 
we believe that these factors will result in a limited number of new opportunities for revenue growth  and will continue to influence quarterly revenue variability in this area of our business 
accordingly  our investments in these products will remain focused on customer support and sustaining engineering efforts  including limited new feature development tied to tangible revenue opportunities 
at the same time  we continue to invest in the area of mobile broadband optimization  which we believe represents an emerging market opportunity 
in the third quarter of fiscal  iqstream became generally available to the market 
iqstream is a mobile broadband optimization solution designed to help operators reduce congestion in mobile access networks 
table of contents caused by rising demand for internet video and other rich media subscriber content 
iqstream is designed to lower the cost of delivering mobile data services by freeing up capacity in the cost sensitive access network 
we currently are engaged in multiple customer trials in different market regions for iqstream 
as previously indicated  the timeframes for our trials have extended longer than originally anticipated due to a number of factors  including the rapid pace of change driving mobile data growth in the backhaul segment of mobile networks  the rigorous and demanding interoperability  security and performance testing required before the solution can be deployed  and certain implementation and feature set requirements of prospective customers 
given the extended trial process for iqstream  we are not providing a date for expected first revenue 
we are pleased with the progress we are making in our iqstream trials and continue to receive strong interest from mobile operators 
converting our iqstream trial prospects into customers remains a top priority 
we continue to consider other strategic options that may serve to enhance stockholder value 
these strategic options include  but are not limited to acquisitions of  or mergers or other business combinations with  companies with complementary technologies or companies in other market segments  the sale or spin off of certain assets  strategic alliances with  or investments in  other entities  the discontinuation or divestiture of certain products  and recapitalization alternatives  including stock buybacks  cash distributions or cash dividends 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million at july  we intend to fund our operations for the foreseeable future  including fixed commitments under operating leases and any required capital expenditures  utilizing these funds 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating requirements and enable us to pursue strategic alternatives 
as of july   sycamore and its subsidiaries employed persons  a net decrease of persons from the persons employed on july  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those relating to revenue recognition  investments  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  litigation and other contingencies  intangible assets and goodwill and share based compensation expense 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
differences between our estimates and the actual results are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the estimate is changed 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates can affect materially the amount of our reported net income or loss 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of sales contracts or agreements and customer purchase orders  delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer or the company receives written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance  
table of contents sales price is fixed or determinable 
the company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and collectability is reasonably assured 
collectability is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history with the company 
the company adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after august  under the new standards  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the individual elements 
for fiscal and future periods  pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  and software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
for transactions initiated prior to august   revenue for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  is allocated to each element using the residual method based on the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to asc topic software revenue recognition 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
as a result of the adoption of asu and asu  revenue for the year ended july   was approximately million higher than the revenue that would have been recorded under the prior revenue recognition guidance 
the company entered into a multiple element arrangement that included hardware and non essential software deliverables 
the hardware element was delivered during the fiscal year and the non essential software element was undelivered as of july  the company recognized million in revenue and deferred million related to this multiple element transaction 
under the prior revenue recognition guidance the company would have deferred million for this multiple element transaction 
the new guidance does not change the units of accounting 
service revenue includes revenue from maintenance  training  and installation services 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
revenue from training and installation services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the service period 
investments our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded as an element of stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments is determined based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments 
we evaluate our investments for potential 
table of contents impairment on a quarterly basis and would recognize an impairment charge should a decline in the fair value of investments below the related cost basis be judged to be other than temporary 
the primary factors that are considered in assessing the nature of the impairment include  i the credit quality of the underlying security  ii the extent to which and time period during which the fair value of the investment has been below cost  iii the expected holding or recovery period for the investment  iv the company s intent to hold each investment until recovery and the likelihood that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery  and v the existence of evidence of default by the issuer 
warranty obligations we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience a change in warranty claims that vary from historical experience in our costs to provide warranty services  we may be required to adjust our warranty accrual 
a change in the warranty accrual will impact our gross margin 
inventory we continuously monitor inventory balances and record inventory provisions for any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand  manufacturing quantities and market conditions 
while such assumptions may change from period to period  we measure the net realizable value of inventories using the best information available as of the balance sheet date 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional inventory provisions may be required 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value can not be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down to its net realizable value is subsequently sold  gross profit margins would be favorably impacted 
litigation and other contingencies we are subject to various claims  litigation and other disputes  as well as potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims  litigation and tax matters and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  it may be necessary to revise our estimates related to these pending claims  litigation and other disputes and potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities are reflected in our results of operations in the period of change and could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
we also review other long lived assets  including purchased intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future results and cash flows that our single reporting unit expects to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets  other long lived assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine 
table of contents whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
to measure impairment for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting unit 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded book value of the goodwill 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
the company had elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment testing on the last business day of our fiscal month june  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
reporting units are defined as operating segments or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
the company had determined that our single reporting unit is a component of our one operating segment 
the estimated fair value of our reporting unit is based on a discounted cash flow model derived from internal earnings and external market forecasts 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in connection with the preparation of its revised plan for fiscal and its outlook beyond  the company updated its estimates of future demand for its core and access products 
the revised outlook resulted in a projection of lower discounted cash flows 
the combination of business  economic and market conditions  together with our estimate of future demand and the resultant cost reduction actions initiated during our fourth quarter of fiscal  combined to give rise to an impairment in the carrying value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to the entire carrying value of goodwill of million  the remaining carrying value of identified intangible assets of million and million related to certain fixed assets 
during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain fixed assets 
these fixed assets were no longer being utilized by the company 
share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we have estimated the fair value of share based options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
results of operations fiscal years ended july  and revenue the following table presents product and service revenue in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue product service total revenue 
table of contents total revenue  which was derived exclusively from our intelligent bandwidth management products and services  decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal product revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in demand for our core products 
service revenue consists primarily of fees for services relating to the maintenance of our products  installation services and training 
service revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in the level of maintenance revenues partially offset by a decrease in installation revenue 
the lower year over year revenue is due in part to the challenging market conditions for our portfolio of intelligent bandwidth management products and our resulting decision to focus on customer support and sustaining engineering efforts versus the development of next generation transmission platforms 
for fiscal  two customers accounted for and of revenue  or a combined of our total revenue 
for fiscal  three customers accounted for  and of revenue  or a combined of our total revenue 
international revenue represented of revenue in fiscal  compared to of revenue in fiscal we expect future revenue will continue to be highly concentrated in a relatively small number of customers 
the timing of customer deployments in any given quarter may cause shifts in both the number of customers comprising greater than of our revenue and in the percentage mix of domestic and international revenue 
the loss of any one of these customers or any substantial reduction or delay in orders by any one of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit the following table presents gross profit for product and services in thousands  except percentages year ended july  gross profit product service total gross profit product service total product gross profit cost of product revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers for purchased materials and services  internal manufacturing costs as well as provisions for warranty and rework costs and adjustments which may be required to reduce inventories to their lower of cost or market 
product gross profit decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in both product gross profit dollars and percentage was primarily due to a decrease in demand for our core products while our fixed manufacturing expenses remained relatively flat year over year 
product gross profit may fluctuate from period to period due to revenue fluctuation  volume  pricing pressures resulting from intense competition in our industry as well as the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers 
in addition  product gross profit may be affected by changes in the mix of products sold  channels of distribution  overhead absorption  sales discounts  increases in labor costs  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  increases in component pricing or other material costs  the introduction of new products or the entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 
service gross profit cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer service contracts  which include salaries and related expenses and other fixed costs 
service gross profit increased in fiscal 
table of contents compared to fiscal the year over year dollar increase relates to a favorable shift in the mix of higher margin maintenance and support services rendered during fiscal compared to installation and training services  and lower year over year fixed costs 
as most of our service cost of revenue is fixed  increases or decreases in revenue will have a significant impact on service gross profit 
service gross profit may be affected in future periods by various factors including  but not limited to  the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  competitive and economic pricing pressures  the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers  maintenance contract renewals and the timing of renewals 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent research and development sales and marketing general and administrative asset impairments restructuring expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related expenses and prototype costs relating to design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower fixed and allocated costs of million resulting from cost containment actions initiated in the prior year  lower personnel costs of million resulting from lower headcount  and lower discretionary expenses of million resulting from the timing of project related costs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses  amortization of customer evaluation inventory and other sales and marketing support expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower fixed and allocated costs of million resulting from cost containment actions initiated in the prior year 
within our existing spending levels  we continue to allocate sales and marketing resources to those geographic regions where we see the most attractive opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary expenses of million resulting from a reduction in professional fees and lower personnel expenses of million resulting from lower headcount 

table of contents asset impairments in conjunction with the workforce reduction and early lease termination plans initiated during fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal related to certain fixed assets 
these fixed assets were no longer being utilized by the company 
restructuring during the first quarter of fiscal  the company made the decision to integrate and realign its operations group with other functional areas to enhance operational efficiency and realize the benefits of identified synergies within the respective groups 
the realignment resulted in the elimination of four positions 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of million  which was charged to cost of product revenue 
this charge relates to employee separation packages including severance pay  benefits continuation and outplacement costs 
in conjunction with the workforce reduction and early lease termination plans initiated in fiscal  certain additional actions were implemented in fiscal these actions were taken to further re align our cost structure  pace our development more closely in line with customer requirements and to better position the company for success in the longer term 
during fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million  of which million was charged to operating expense and million to cost of product revenue 
this charge related to i employee separation packages  including severance pay  benefits continuation and outplacement costs amounting to million  of which million was charged to operating expense and million to cost of product revenue  ii a million charge for a termination agreement related to our moorestown  new jersey facility  and iii a million charge related to the consolidation of our chelmsford  massachusetts facility for rent associated with the portion of the facility that is no longer being used 
as of july   remaining restructuring payments associated with these actions were million 
there can be no assurances that similar actions may not be required in the future 
interest and other income  net the following table presents interest and other income  net in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent interest and other income  net interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due a lower average investment balance primarily as a result of the cash distributions that were paid on december  and december  and to lower interest rates in fiscal when compared to fiscal income tax expense income tax expense of million was recorded in fiscal primarily related to income tax expense in certain states and profitable foreign jurisdictions 
income tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit reflects the tax effect of the november enactment of the home ownership and business assistance act of the new law provided for the utilization of previously of certain net operating loss carrybacks against alternative minimum taxable income and results in an aggregate refund of alternative minimum tax paid of million for fiscal and fiscal the benefit was partially offset by income tax expense in certain states and profitable foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents as a result of having realized substantial accumulated net operating losses  the company determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
therefore  we maintain a full valuation allowance 
if the company generates sustained future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some or all of the net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized and the valuation allowance reversed 
if the valuation allowance is reversed  portions would be recorded as an increase to paid in capital and the remainder would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense

general and 
table of contents administrative costs are net of insurance recoveries associated with the company s now concluded stock option investigation 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an insurance recovery of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  which had the effect of reducing general and administrative expenses in fiscal the impact of the lower insurance recoveries was partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses of million resulting from the cost reductions initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal and a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets of million due to the full write off of such assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal asset impairments in conjunction with the workforce reduction and early lease termination plans initiated during fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal related to certain fixed assets 
these fixed assets were no longer being utilized by the company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and in connection with the preparation of its revised plan for fiscal and its outlook beyond  the company updated its estimates of future demand for its core and access products 
the revised outlook resulted in a projection of lower discounted cash flows 
accordingly  the company conducted an assessment for impairment for its long lived assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of june   the last day of our fiscal month june  the company performed its annual goodwill assessment based on its revised outlook and discounted cash flow analysis 
the assessment indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
the subsequent step required that a valuation be conducted  similar to a purchase price allocation done in connection with an acquisition  in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
since the company operates as a single operating unit  the fair value of the intangible assets was determined as part of this valuation 
the result of the valuations determined that the reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets were impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets 
in addition  certain fixed assets were also impaired  resulting in an additional non cash impairment charge of million

the charges included workforce reductions primarily in sales  marketing  manufacturing and general administrative functions during the first and second quarters of fiscal totaling million million operating expense and million cost of product revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced further workforce reductions 
certain of those workforce reductions  primarily affecting research and development  were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in a charge of million 
the charge for workforce reductions primarily 
table of contents related to employee separation packages  which include severance pay  benefits continuation and outplacement costs

interest and other income  net the following table presents interest and other income  net in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent interest and other income  net interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal when compared to fiscal and a lower average investment balance as a result of the cash distribution that was paid on december  income tax expense income tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal versus an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit reflects the tax effect of the november enactment of the home ownership and business assistance act of the new law provides for the utilization of previously of certain net operating loss carrybacks against alternative minimum taxable income and results in an aggregate refund of alternative minimum tax paid of million for fiscal and fiscal the fiscal tax benefit reflects the benefit from the refundable federal research and development credit and a million benefit from the reversal of the accumulated deferred tax liability recognized from the impairment of the indefinite lived intangible assets 
the benefit in both years was partially offset by income tax expense in certain states and profitable foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources year ended july  total cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at july  compared to million at july  included in the july  balances were cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at july  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million was primarily attributable to cash used in financing activities of million and cash used in operating activities of million  offset by cash provided by investing activities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and consisted of net maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million 
net loss was million and included non cash charges  including share based compensation of million  an inventory provision of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
accounts receivable decreased to million at july  from million at july  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding are impacted primarily by the timing of shipments  collections performance and timing of support contract renewals 
deferred revenue decreased to million at july  from million at july  the decrease resulted from slightly lower deferred product shipments and the timing of service billings 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million 
on december   the company made a cash distribution to its stockholders of per share of its common stock  par value  amounting to million 
as a result of having an accumulated deficit  the cash distribution has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
the impact of the cash distribution was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash  cash equivalents and investments  which totaled million as of july  our investments are classified as available for sale and consist of securities that are readily convertible to cash  including certificates of deposits and government securities 
as of july   million of investments with maturities of less than one year were classified as short term investments 
based on our current expectations  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments may be consumed by operations 
certain investments have unrealized losses and the company s intent and ability is to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represent a concentration of credit risk because the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of a relatively small number of customer account balances 
as of july   more than of our accounts receivable balance was attributable to five of our customers 
as of july   we do not have any outstanding debt or credit facilities  and do not anticipate entering into any debt or credit agreements in the foreseeable future 
our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases and inventory purchase commitments 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures  or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities and inventory purchase commitments 
we currently intend to fund our operations  including our fixed commitments under operating leases  and any required capital expenditures using our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our current investment activities is to preserve investment principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government debt securities 
these available for sale investments are subject to interest rate risk and may decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates increased immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at july   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity while the majority of our operations are based in the united states  our business is global  with international revenue representing of total revenue in fiscal we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
generally  sales outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars 
in the future  to the extent that sales outside of the united states might be denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our financial results  although to date such impact has not been material 
we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currencies if the exposure is material  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date
