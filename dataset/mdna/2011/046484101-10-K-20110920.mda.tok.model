item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue for our aso business unit is primarily generated from various fixed priced contracts with launch service providers in both the commercial and governmental markets 
the services and facilities we provide to our customers support the final assembly  checkout  and countdown functions associated with preparing a spacecraft for launch 
other factors that have impacted  and are expected to continue to impact earnings and cash flows for this business include our ability to control our capital expenditures  which are primarily limited to modifications to accommodate payload processing for new launch vehicles  upgrading communications infrastructure and other building improvements 
the continuing limited availability of competing facilities at the major domestic launch sites that can offer comparable services  leading to an increase in use of our services 

table of contents our ability to complete customer specified facility modifications within budgeted costs and time commitments 
our ability to control and reduce costs in order to maximize profitability of our fixed priced contracts 
spacetech our spacetech business unit is an incubator intended to develop space industry technologies into commercial applications to be sold to consumers and industry 
spacetech is currently working on two business initiatives st detect corporation and astrogenetix  inc st detect s business began under a space act agreement with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for a chemical detection unit to be used on the international space station 
st detect engineers have developed a miniature chemical detector  based on ion trap mass spectrometry  that we believe fills a niche by being highly accurate  lightweight  battery powered  durable and inexpensive 
astrogenetix is a biotechnology company created to use the unique environment of space to discover and develop novel vaccine and novel therapeutic products 
a natural extension of the many years of experience preparing  launching  and operating scientific payloads in space  astrogenetix is in the process of developing products from microgravity discoveries 
business strategy astrotech space operations as a leading commercial provider of payload processing services  aso strives to provide our customers with the most advanced facilities and customer support that are unparalleled in the industry 
with that mission in mind  aso is continuously working to secure additional government and commercial customers that require our unique capabilities 
additionally  aso works to further grow the business with our service offering designing  building  and operating spacecraft processing equipment and facilities 
spacetech st detect is developing what we expect will be a revolutionary chemical detector based on ion trap mass spectrometry  which allows for the device s portability  versatility  sensitivity  durability and high speed at a low cost 
potential markets that st detect may serve include security and defense  industrial  medical and healthcare  critical infrastructure  and first responders 
over the last three years  astrogenetix has pursued an aggressive space access strategy to take advantage of the space shuttle program prior to its retirement 
this strategy gave astrogenetix unprecedented access to research in microgravity  as the company flew twelve experiments in this three year period 
astrogenetix dedicated its limited resources on pursuing this strategy of maximizing flight opportunities 
astrogenetix is currently focused on developing a salmonella vaccine as part of the ongoing commercialization strategy 
concurrently  astrogenetix is working on the continued development of a vaccine target for methicilin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa based on discoveries made in microgravity 
products and services astrotech space operations from our state of the art facilities in titusville  florida and vandenberg air force base vafb in california  aso has provided support for pre launch ground based operations for nearly years for both commercial and government satellites  and we are the leader in this sector 
our service offering includes advance planning  use of our unique facilities  and spacecraft checkout  encapsulation  fueling  and transport 
additionally  aso has extensive experience in designing  building  and operating spacecraft processing equipment and facilities 
aso also provides propellant services including designing  building and testing propellant service equipment for servicing spacecraft 
spacetech st detect s miniature chemical detector is a universal chemical analyzer that provides rapid analysis time and is capable of detecting residues and vapors from a wide range of chemicals including explosives  chemical warfare agents  toxic chemicals  and volatile organic compounds 
st detect s proprietary technology  leveraging advances in low power electronics and miniaturization technologies developed for the space program  allows for the device s portability  versatility  sensitivity  durability and efficiency at a low cost 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the united states patent and trademark office issued a key patent to st detect for its unique method to drive a mass spectrometer ion trap used for chemical detection and identification 
astrogenetix has used the unique environment of microgravity to discover a potential vaccine candidate for salmonella  which validates the use of microgravity in identifying commercially viable biomarkers 
astrogenetix believes this provides significant advantages over traditional earthbound vaccine discovery processes  thus reducing the development time and cost significantly for researchers 
follow on work with mrsa has resulted in the identification of a potential vaccine target for that microbe as well 
in addition to astrogenetix s proprietary research  the company has the capabilities to provide external researchers with the knowledge and access needed for microgravity research 

table of contents customers  sales and marketing astrotech space operations aso services a variety of domestic and international government and commercial customers sending satellites and spacecraft to low earth orbit  geosynchronous orbit  or on planetary missions 
aso has long term contracts in place with nasa  other us governmental agencies  and united launch alliance 
aso continues to look for opportunities to support spacecraft processing for government and commercial customers 
during fiscal year  aso accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
spacetech the broadband nature of the st detect technology  as well as the high performance provided by the ion trap architecture  opens up st detect to a variety of applications 
potential markets that st detect may serve include security and defense  industrial  medical and healthcare  critical infrastructure  and first responders 
astrogenetix is currently focused on starting the fda process with the salmonella vaccine candidate and is continuing drug development work for mrsa 
competition astrotech space operations the majority of the company s revenue is derived from aso  which processes satellites for us launch locations 
the only significant competition to aso s facilities is from commercial competitor spaceport systems international ssi and certain us government facilities 
however  we believe that the majority of domestic satellites  including many government satellites  are processed at aso due to the state of the art  professionally operated  full service environment 
commercial ssi operates and manages a commercial spaceport at vafb and is a provider of payload processing and launch services for both commercial and government users 
the ssi facility throughput capability is significantly less than that of aso in vafb and it is heavily influenced by government customers 
the aso vafb contract award for the five meter high bay construction significantly improves aso s competitive advantage at vafb 
ssi does not provide payload processing services in support of the cape canaveral air force station ccafs kennedy space center ksc launch site  and therefore  does not compete with aso in florida 
governmental nasa and the united states air force own and operate payload processing facilities at both the ccafs ksc and vafb launch sites 
these facilities  however  are used to process select government spacecraft only 
they are not used to process commercial spacecraft 
therefore  aso s competition from the us government is limited in scope 
spacetech there are many incumbent vendors that will compete with st detect s miniature chemical detector 
however  we believe the st detect product offers a combination of attributes that are currently unavailable in the marketplace in a single product 
regarding astrogenetix  there are many earthbound developers of vaccines  including most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biotechnology firms 
however  there are no known competitors to astrogenetix developing vaccines in microgravity 
with the completion of the construction of the iss and the focus of the iss now on operations through year  competition from foreign governments  academia and commercial companies is anticipated 
research and development we incurred million and million in research and development expense during fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development in fiscal year has been primarily directed towards development of st detect s miniature chemical detector and astrogenetix s microgravity processing platform 
astrogenetix continues to work on its investigational new drug application for its salmonella vaccine candidate while also furthering its research on mrsa which has led to a potential vaccine target for the deadly microbe  but the primary focus of and was to utilize the last remaining space shuttle flights before the program retirement

in thousands contract backlog month rolling aso missions aso facility programs spacetech grants total backlog the month rolling backlog for aso consists of pre launch satellite processing services  which include hardware launch preparation  advance planning  use of unique satellite preparation facilities and spacecraft checkout  encapsulation  fueling  and transport and design and fabrication of equipment and hardware for space launch activities at our titusville  florida and vafb locations 
the month rolling backlog for spacetech consists of grant revenue from the sbir program 
certain regulatory matters we are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment in order to protect our domestic technology from unintended foreign exploitation and to regulate certain business practices 
we believe that our policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and consequential financial liability to us 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations and technology export requirements has not had in the past  and  we believe  will not have in the future  material effects on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
our operations are also subject to various regulations under federal laws relative to the international transfer of technology  as well as to various federal and state laws relative to business operations 
in addition  we are subject to federal contracting procedures  audit  and oversight 
significant federal regulations impacting our operations include the following federal regulation of international business 
we are subject to various federal regulations as it relates to the export of certain goods  services  and technology 
these regulations  which include the export administration act of administered by the commerce department and the arms export control act administered by the state department  impose substantial restrictions on the sharing or transfer of technology to foreign entities 
our activities in the development of space technology and in the processing of commercial satellites deal with the type of technology subject to these regulations 
our operations are conducted pursuant to a comprehensive export compliance policy that provides close review and documentation of activities subject to these laws and regulations 
foreign corrupt practices act 
the foreign corrupt practices act establishes rules for us companies doing business internationally 
compliance with these rules is achieved through established and enforced corporate policies  documented internal procedures  and financial controls 
iran nonproliferation act of this act includes specific prohibitions on commercial activities with certain specified russian entities engaged in providing goods or services to the international space station 
our activities with rsc energia of russia are not subject to this act 
federal acquisition regulations 
goods and services provided by us to nasa and other us government agencies are subject to federal acquisition regulations 
these regulations provide rules and procedures for invoicing  documenting  and conducting business under contract with such entities 
the federal acquisition regulations also subject us to audit by federal auditors to confirm such compliance 
truth in negotiations act 
the truth in negotiations act was enacted for the purpose of providing full and fair disclosure by contractors in the conduct of negotiations with the us government 
the most significant provision included in the truth in negotiations act is the requirement that contractors submit certified cost and pricing data for negotiated procurements above a defined threshold 
defense security service 
occasionally  we are requested to process government spacecraft payloads that must be handled under federal security clearances 
to accommodate these requirements  we maintain facility security clearances within certain subsidiaries of the company and have persons engaged by the company with necessary active security clearances to support these requirements 
maintenance of an active facility clearance requires dedicated trained personnel  specified facility standards and recordkeeping 

table of contents regulatory compliance and risk management we maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and manage our risks through a program of compliance  awareness  and insurance  which includes the following safety 
we place a continual emphasis on safety throughout our organization 
at the corporate level  safety programs and training are monitored by a corporate safety manager 
export control compliance 
we have a designated senior officer responsible for export control issues and the procedures detailed in our export control policy 
this officer and the designated export compliance administrator monitor training and compliance with regulations relative to foreign business activities 
employees are provided comprehensive training in compliance with regulations relative to export and foreign activities through our interactive training program and are certified as proficient in such regulations as are relative to their job responsibilities 
insurance 
our aso operations  which are centered around specialized and unique processing facilities in titusville  florida and vafb  are subject to risk and potential loss due to a number of factors  but most notably  the transportation of heavy equipment and the consistent use by customers and employees 
to mitigate this risk we strive to maintain our facilities in optimal condition and we hold property and casualty lines of insurance on each of our facilities and a general liability policy for astrotech 
employees update as of june   we employed regular full time employees  none of which were covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
in june  general ret 
lance w 
lord resigned from the board of directors of astrotech and as the chief executive officer of astrotech space operations 
the vacancy on the board of directors created by general lord s resignation was fulfilled pursuant to the election of daniel t 
russler  jr 
at our annual meeting of shareholders on april  the company does not currently have any plans to fill the role of chief executive officer  astrotech space operations 
in july  the company simultaneously announced the termination of james royston  president of astrotech corporation  and a realignment of its corporate structure in order to optimize operational efficiencies 
the company s action follows an evaluation of each business and a review of strategic alternatives 
the corporate realignment will allow astrotech to put a greater focus on the pre launch satellite service offering of its aso business unit 
item a 
risk factors 
given the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the businesses that we engage in  our results from operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted as set forth below 
our success depends significantly on the establishment and maintenance of successful relationships with our customers 
we have relied on governmental customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
approximately of our revenue in fiscal year was generated by various nasa and us government contracts or subcontracts 
the loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot make any assurances that any customer will require our services in the future 
therefore  we continue to work on diversifying our customer base to include other government agencies and commercial industries  while going to great lengths to satisfy the needs of our current customer base 
termination of our future orders could negatively impact our revenues 
the company s rolling backlog at june   which includes contractual backlog and scheduled but uncommitted missions  is million 
the majority is for aso pre launch satellite processing services  which include hardware launch preparation  advance planning  use of unique satellite preparation facilities  and spacecraft checkout  encapsulation  fueling and transport 
since our backlog is not yet earned and can be terminated by our customers  we cannot assure that our backlog will ultimately result in revenues 
a branch of the us government or a commercial competitor could construct spacecraft ground processing facilities  which could significantly reduce the number of missions using astrotech facilities 
astrotech provides services for domestic launch sites 
in the event that the us government constructs spacecraft ground processing facilities for the launch sites currently serviced by astrotech  there could be a reduced need for the use of astrotech facilities 
this would result in direct competition for our existing customers in connection with servicing domestic launch sites  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any new competitor in this area or that these competitive pressures we may face will not result in reduced revenues and market share 

table of contents compliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively affect our financial condition 
our business  particularly our aso business unit  is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of our facilities and the release or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances  including spacecraft fuels and oxidizers  into the environment 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injury and cleaning costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil  and criminal penalties 
in the event of a violation of these laws  or a release of hazardous substances at or from our facilities  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a us government contractor  we are subject to a number of rules and regulations  the violation of which could result in us being barred from future us government contracts 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
these laws and regulations  among other things require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations 
impose acquisition regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts 
restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties  the termination of our contracts  or disbarment from bidding on us government contracts 
additionally  us government contracts generally contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of certain federal laws or regulations  reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract  and control and potentially prohibit the export of our services and associated materials 
prohibition against bidding on future us government contracts would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to comply with us export control laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are obligated by law and under contract to comply  and to ensure that our subcontractors comply  with all us export control laws and regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations and the export administration regulations 
we are responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals  if required  for exports of hardware  technical data  and software  or for the provision of technical assistance 
we are also required to obtain export licenses  if required  before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of our contracts if the foreign person will have access to export controlled technical data or software 
the violation of any of the applicable export control laws and regulations  whether by us or any of our subcontractors  could subject us to administrative  civil  and criminal penalties 
our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the us government 
us government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations  and standards 
the us government may also review the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation  and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm that may affect our non governmental business if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
our spacetech business unit is in an early development stage 
it has earned limited revenues and it is uncertain whether it will earn any revenues in the future or whether it will ultimately be profitable 
our spacetech business unit is in an early development stage with limited commercial sales and a limited operating history 
its future operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including  but not limited to  risks related to capital requirements  failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages as against larger and more established companies 
the spacetech business unit will require substantial amounts of funding to develop  test  and commercialize its products 
if such funding comes in the form of equity financing  such equity financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders 
even with funding  our product development program may not lead to commercial products  either because our product candidates fail to be effective or are not attractive to the market or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization 

table of contents the spacetech business unit can be expected to experience significant operating losses until it can generate sufficient revenues to cover its operating costs 
the spacetech business unit currently has no commercial products and there can be no assurance that the business will be able to develop  manufacture or market any products in the future  that future revenues will be significant  that any sales will be profitable or that the business will have sufficient funds available to complete its marketing and development programs or to market any products which it may develop 
any products and technologies developed and manufactured by our spacetech business unit may require regulatory approval prior to being made  marketed  sold  and used 
there can be no assurance that regulatory approval of any products will be obtained 
the commercial success of the spacetech business unit is expected to depend  in part  on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in any products it develops 
in addition  the spacetech business unit may need to license intellectual property to commercialize future products or avoid infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
the spacetech business unit may suffer if any licenses terminate  if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties  if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid  or if the spacetech business unit is unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms 
if the spacetech business unit  or any third party  from whom it licenses intellectual property  fails to obtain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property covering its products  or if any protection is reduced or eliminated  others could use the intellectual property covering the products  resulting in harm to the competitive business position of the spacetech business unit 
in addition  patent and other intellectual property protection may not provide the spacetech business unit with a competitive advantage against competitors that devise ways of making competitive products without infringing any patents that the spacetech business unit owns or has rights to 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for any products or the market share of the spacetech business unit and could have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations and financial condition 
our facilities located in florida and california are susceptible to damage caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  or other natural disasters 
our aso spacecraft processing facilities on the east coast of florida are susceptible to damage caused by hurricanes or other natural disasters 
in addition  our satellite processing facilities at vafb are subject to damage caused by earthquakes 
although we insure our properties and maintain business interruption insurance  there can be no guarantee that the coverage would be sufficient or a claim will be fulfilled 
a natural disaster could result in a temporary or permanent closure of our business operations  thus impacting our future financial performance 
due to our dependence on the timing of spacecraft launches  our results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the use of our aso spacecraft processing facilities is highly dependent upon the number of satellite launches planned and executed each year 
additionally  factors beyond our direct control  such as a delay or accident at a launch vehicle support facility  could cause a material change in our financial results 
as a result  significant fluctuations should be expected from quarter to quarter in our operating results 
the loss of key management and other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management  and our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
failure to attract personnel sufficiently qualified to execute our strategy  or to retain existing key personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to anticipate technological advances and customer requirements in the commercial and governmental markets  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our business strategy outlines the use of decades of experience to expand the services and products we offer to both government agencies and commercial industries 
we believe that our growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to anticipate technological advances and customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the necessary technological advances for us to remain competitive 
in fiscal year  we continued new business initiatives for advancing commerce in space 
these new business initiatives will require substantial investments of capital and technical expertise 
our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technological and market requirements  or delays in additional product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
additionally  the cost of capital to fund these businesses will likely require dilution of shareholders 

table of contents our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to pay off or refinance our indebtedness with near term maturities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we cannot assure that our business will generate cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our maturing indebtedness as it comes due 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of the debt or we may need to secure new financing before maturity 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all  particularly given the general economic situation and lending environment we currently face 
our earnings and margins may vary due to the nature of our fixed priced contracts 
our business mix includes cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed price contracts 
our aso business unit contracts are mainly fixed price contracts 
if we are unable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  the costs incurred to operate our core aso business are near term fixed 
as a result  if we are not able to schedule payload processing in order to optimize our facilities  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we plan to develop new products and services 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully develop these products and services 
our business strategy outlines the use of the decades of experience we have accumulated to expand the services and products we offer to both us government and commercial industries 
these services and products generally involve the commercial exploitation of space  and involve new and untested technologies and business models 
these technologies and business models may not be successful  which could result in the loss of any investment we make in developing them 
our financial results could be adversely affected if the estimates that we use in accounting for contracts are incorrect and need to be changed 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for scheduling and technical issues 
we rely on the application of consistent business processes in order to minimize material error and maximize reporting transparency 
the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion for many of our contracts is complicated and subject to many unknown variables 
if our performance under a cost reimbursable contract results in an award fee that is lower than we have estimated  we would be required to refund previously billed fee amounts and would have to adjust our revenue recognition accordingly 
if our performance was determined to be significantly deficient  we may be required to reimburse our customers for the entire amount of previously billed awards 
changes in underlying assumptions  circumstances  or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance 
our spacecraft payload processing facilities are specifically designed to process satellites and other payloads and we would lose a substantial portion of their value if we no longer provide these services 
our aso spacecraft processing facilities were built specifically to process satellites and space related payloads 
if we were required to terminate the processing businesses  the value of these facilities could be impaired and  as a result  our financial condition and results of operations would likely be negatively impacted 
our inability to maintain required government security clearances and the impact of foreign ownership or control could result in a loss of potential future spacecraft ground processing and other opportunities 
in order to be a service and product provider for spacecraft ground processing and other related activities  we are required to maintain certain government security clearances and we must comply with laws that limit foreign ownership and control 
we may be subject to regulatory action and other sanctions if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to required security clearances and foreign ownership and control 
this could harm our reputation  our prospects for future work  and our operating results 
we incur substantial upfront  non reimbursable costs in preparing proposals to bid on contracts that we may not be awarded 
preparing a proposal to bid on a contract is generally a three to six month process 
this process is labor intensive and results in the incurrence of substantial costs that are generally not retrievable 
additionally  although we may be awarded a contract  work performance does not commence for several months following completion of the bidding process 
if funding problems by the party awarding the contract or other matters further delay our commencement of work  these delays may lower the value of the contract  or possibly render it unprofitable 
if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market it may harm our stock price and make it more difficult to sell shares 
on august   we received a nasdaq staff determination letter indicating that we failed to comply with nasdaq marketplace rule c  which requires that we maintain a bid price  and our securities were  therefore  subject to delisting from the nasdaq capital market 
in order to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with this requirement 
if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  the level of trading activity of our common stock may decline and it may harm our stock price  increase the volatility of our stock price and make it more difficult to sell your shares of our common stock

additionally  aso provides propellant services including designing  building and testing propellant service equipment for servicing spacecraft 
aso accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended june  revenue for our aso business unit is generated primarily from various fixed priced contracts with launch service providers in both the commercial and government markets 
the services and facilities we provide to our customers support the final assembly  checkout  and countdown functions associated with preparing a spacecraft for launch 
the revenue and cash flows generated from our aso operations are related to the number of spacecraft launches  which reflects the growth in the satellite based communications industries and the requirement to replace aging satellites 
other factors that have impacted  and are expected to continue to impact earnings and cash flows for this business include our ability to control our capital expenditures  which primarily are limited to modifications to accommodate payload processing for new launch vehicles  upgrading communications infrastructure and other building improvements 
the continuing limited availability of competing facilities at the major domestic launch sites that can offer comparable services  leading to an increase in government use of our services 

table of contents our ability to complete customer specified facility modifications within budgeted costs and time commitments 
our ability to control and reduce costs in order to maximize profitability of our fixed priced contracts 
spacetech our other business unit is an incubator intended to commercialize space industry technologies into commercial applications to be sold to consumers and industry

the st detect miniature chemical detector  which is in development  is a low power  portable chemical detection device 
st detect has been awarded a developmental testing and evaluation designation from the us department of homeland security as a promising anti terrorism technology  and is the recipient of a phase i and phase ii award from the us army s chemical and biological defense cbd small business innovation research sbir program 
following the successful execution of the phase i sbir  st detect was awarded a million phase ii sbir contract from the joint science and technology office for chemical and biological defense 
additionally  st detect received a million award from the texas emerging technology fund in march astrogenetix is a biotechnology company formed to commercialize products processed in the unique environment of microgravity 
astrogenetix has pursued an aggressive space access strategy to take advantage of the space shuttle program prior to its retirement  which occurred in this strategy gave astrogenetix unprecedented access to research in microgravity  as the company flew twelve experiments over a three year period 
astrogenetix is currently developing a salmonella vaccine as part of the ongoing commercialization strategy 
concurrently  astrogenetix is working on the continued development of a vaccine target for methicilin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa based on discoveries made in microgravity 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition astrotech recognizes revenue employing several generally accepted revenue recognition methodologies across its business units 
the methodology used is based on contract type and the manner in which products and services are provided 
revenue generated by astrotech s payload processing facilities is recognized ratably over the occupancy period of the satellite while in the astrotech facilities 
the percentage of completion method is used for all contracts where incurred costs can be reasonably estimated and successful completion can be reasonably assured at inception 
changes in estimated costs to complete and provisions for contract losses are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue for the sale of commercial products is recognized at shipment 
a summary of revenue recognition methods services products provided contract type method of revenue recognition payload processing facilities firm fixed price mission specific ratably  over the occupancy period of a satellite within the facility from arrival through launch firm fixed price guaranteed number of missions for multi year contract  payments recognized ratably over the contract period commercial space habitat modules  integration operations support services and construction contracts firm fixed price percentage of completion based on costs incurred configuration management  engineering services cost reimbursable award fixed fee reimbursable costs incurred plus award fixed fee commercial products specific purchase order based at shipment grant cost reimbursable award as costs are incurred for related research and development expenses 
table of contents under certain contracts  we make expenditures for specific enhancements and or additions to our facilities where the customer agrees to pay a fixed fee to deliver the enhancement or addition 
we account for such agreements as a reduction in the cost of such investments and recognize any excess of amounts collected above the expenditure as revenue 
revenue for aso recognized under a building modification contract with a government agency was accounted for under the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred over the period of the agreement 
long lived asset in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  fixed assets  assets under construction and intangible assets  we evaluate the recoverability of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents amounts collected from customers for projects  products  or services expected to be provided at a future date 
deferred revenue is shown on the balance sheet as either a short term or long term liability  depending on when the service or product is expected to be provided 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based awards to employees based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using expected dividend yields of the company s stock  the expected volatility of the stock  the expected length of time the options remain outstanding and risk free interest rates 
changes in one or more of these factors may significantly affect the estimated fair value of the stock options 
additionally  the company estimates the number of instruments for which the required service is expected to be rendered 
the company estimates forfeitures using historical forfeiture rates for previous grants of equity instruments 
the fair value of awards that are expected to vest is recorded as an expense over the vesting period 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest accounting is applied for any entities where the company maintains more than and less than ownership 
the company clearly identifies the noncontrolling interest in the balance sheets and income statements 
we also disclose three measures of net income net income  net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  and net income attributable to astrotech corporation 
our operating cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows reflect net income  while our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect net income attributable to astrotech corporation 
state of texas funding the company accounts for the state of texas funding in the amount of million in its majority owned subsidiary st detect as a contribution of capital and has reflected the disbursement in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
while the award agreement includes both a common stock purchase right and a note payable to the state of texas  the economic substance of the transaction is that the state of texas has purchased shares of st detect in exchange for the granted award 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   the company has established a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets 
fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the company had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits on june   but has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of million for the period ended june  
table of contents for the year ended june  and  the company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to recording changes to the valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and in various states 
due to the company s loss carryover position  it is subject to us federal and state income tax examination adjustments to its carryover benefits generated after currently  the company is under examination by the internal revenue service for its through tax year
