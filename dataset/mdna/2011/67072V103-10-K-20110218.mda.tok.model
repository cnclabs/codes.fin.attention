item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we report the results of our operations in two segments the system one segment and the in center segment 
we distribute our products in three markets home  critical care and in center 
within the system one segment  we offer a similar technology platform of the system one for the home and critical care markets with different features 
we offer primarily needles and blood tubing sets in the in center segment 
our products are predominantly used by our customers to treat patients suffering from esrd or acute kidney failure 
we have marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market  although nearly all sales in the in center segment are made through distributors 
during  we grew our revenues by from million during to million during  with growth occurring in each market home  critical care and in center 
in the home market  revenues increased million  or  during compared to  with the significant majority resulting from an increase in the number of patients prescribed to use and centers offering the system one 
during  we increased both the average number of patients at existing centers and the number of total centers offering the system one  through new and existing relationships with service providers  including davita and fresenius 
critical care market revenues increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to increased sales of the system one resulting from our efforts to increase our market share and increased sales of disposables from our growing installed base of system one equipment 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our revenues  primarily driven by the system one segment due to the annuity nature of our business  as well as the life sustaining  non elective nature of dialysis therapy 
our two largest customers in the home market  davita and fresenius  will be important to that growth 
if the purchasing patterns of either of these customers adversely change  our business will be adversely affected  at least in the near term 
in center revenues increased million  or  during compared to the increase was driven by increased sales of our needle products 
we expect future demand will continue to be susceptible to fluctuation as a result of increased competition and variations in inventory management policies with both our distributors and end users 
we continue to see improvements in our financial performance below the revenue line 
we have not yet achieved profitable operating margins  but we continue to improve gross margins and cash flows from operating activities 
we have consistently improved gross margin on a quarterly and annual basis from during to during to during the improvements in gross margin were primarily driven by lower overall costs of revenues resulting from improvements in product design and reliability  leveraging our manufacturing infrastructure  transition of manufacturing and equipment service to lower cost labor markets and pricing strategies 
during  cash flows from operating activities were positive due to improvements in net loss versus and a million one time customer prepayment on first quarter orders 
while we expect to see continued improvements to our cash flows from operating activities  driven in meaningful part through continued improvement in our gross profits  in the near term  we expect cash flows from operating activities on a quarterly basis to fluctuate between negative and positive  primarily due to changes in working capital 
we are encouraged by the improvements to our operating margins and are continuing to work hard toward our long term goal of achieving profitable operating margins 
however  there 
table of contents can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to improve our operating margins or achieve positive operating margins 
our ability to become profitable and  its timing and sustainability  depend principally upon continued improvements in gross margins  growing revenues  and leverage of our operating infrastructure including any investment in selling and marketing or research and development activities 
statement of operations components revenues in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
in the home market  customers purchase or rent the system one equipment  including cycler and pureflow sl  and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
in the critical care market  we sell or rent the system one and related disposables to hospital customers 
in the in center segment  we derive our revenues from the sale of needles and blood tubing sets 
nearly all of our sales in the in center segment are through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
in the home market the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring sales of disposable products 
for customers that purchase the system one  we recognize revenue from the equipment sale ratably over the expected service obligation period 
for customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenue on a monthly basis 
we recognize revenues related to the disposable products upon delivery 
over time  as more home patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of related disposables 
our contracts with dialysis centers in the home market for esrd home dialysis patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to the number of prescribed treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in most instances  our pureflow sl hardware 
these contracts typically have a term of one to seven years  and may be renewed on a month to month basis thereafter  subject to a day termination notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis center 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the shipment of products to a designated vacation destination for a specified number of vacation days 
we derive a small amount of revenues from the sale of supplementary products and services such as ancillaries  reserve inventory and special deliveries 
in the critical care market we recognize revenues from direct product sales at the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
our contracts with hospitals generally include terms providing for the sale of our system one hardware and disposables  although we also provide a hardware rental option 
these contracts typically have a term of one year 
we derive a small amount of revenues from the sale of one and two year service contracts following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
to further support service in the critical care market  we have a bio medical training program  whereby we train bio medical engineers on how to service and repair certain aspects of the system one in the critical care setting 
bio medical training is typically provided under a two year contract following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
as more system one equipment is placed within hospitals  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable cartridges and fluids as well as  to a much lesser degree  from the sale of service and bio medical training contracts 
in the in center segment  nearly all sales to end users are structured through supply and distribution contracts with several significant distributors 
these contracts typically contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing triggers at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain cure rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  we offer certain customers rebates based on sales to specific end users and discounts for early payment 
our revenues are presented net of these rebates and discounts 
as of december   we had million and million reserved against trade accounts 
table of contents receivable for future rebates and discounts for customers in our in center and system one segments  respectively 
we recorded million  million and million during  and  respectively  as a reduction of in center segment revenues and million  million and million during  and  respectively  as a reduction of system one segment revenues in connection with rebates and discounts 
currently nearly all of our revenues have been generated from sales to customers in the us however  in we began selling our system one and certain of our other products internationally through distributors 
for sales to our international distributors  we recognize revenues from the equipment sale ratably over the expected term of our remaining obligation  which is typically five years 
we recognize revenues related to the disposable products upon delivery 
however  effective january   we adopted two new accounting standard updates  or asus  which will affect revenue recognition for sales to our international distributors within the system one segment 
under the new asus  for international sales beginning january   we will recognize revenues from equipment sales to international distributors at the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
we will adopt the new asus prospectively and therefore  equipment shipped prior to january  will continue to be recognized as revenues ratably 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we sell or rent to customers and manufacturing overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing system one equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and stock based compensation for certain personnel 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs and the design of our products 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients and their partners in the operation of our products and customer service and technical support personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight costs of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreements with our customers  salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel and the cost of any equipment lost or damaged in the distribution process 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and do not operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products under warranty from customers back to our service center for repair and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers or their patients 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees of outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services  and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses

during  we increased both the average number of patients at existing centers and the number of total centers offering the system one  through new and existing relationships with service providers  including davita and fresenius 
critical care market revenues increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to increased sales of the system one resulting from our efforts to further penetrate the market and increased sales of disposables from our growing number of system one equipment placed within hospitals 
growth in the critical care market in also benefitted from slightly improved economic conditions compared to future demand for our products in both the home and critical care markets is expected to remain strong due to the life sustaining  non elective nature of dialysis therapy 
as we further penetrate these markets and as we expand internationally  we expect revenues in the home and critical care markets to continue to increase 
in center segment revenues increased million  or  during compared to the increase in revenues was due to increased sales of our needles 
we expect future demand will continue to be susceptible to fluctuation as a result of increased competition and variations in inventory management policies with both our distributors and end users 
gross profit our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  revenues revenues system one segment in center segment gross profit the increase in gross profit was a result of increased revenues and improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was attributable to improvements in the system one segment  specifically  lower costs resulting from certain costs saving initiatives and improvements in product design  decreased equipment service costs per unit resulting from improved product reliability  lower overall cost of manufacturing as we continue to realize the benefits of leveraging our manufacturing infrastructure  increased relative sales of higher margin products and certain pricing strategies 
gross profit for the in center segment decreased slightly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues during compared to  due to costs incurred related to manufacturing process improvements to support future growth 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues will continue to improve over time for three general reasons  all of which we expect will reduce costs in the future 
first  we expect to introduce additional process improvements and product design changes that have inherently lower cost than our current products 
second  we anticipate that increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale will lead to better purchasing terms and prices and efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs 
finally  we expect to continue to improve product reliability  which would reduce unit service costs 
additionally  given the longevity of certain of our system one field equipment assets  in the fourth quarter of we changed the estimated useful life of these assets from five to seven years which will result in lower field equipment depreciation costs in the near term 
however  there is no certainty that our expectations will be achieved with respect to these cost reduction plans 

table of contents selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change system one segment in center segment total selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily the result of increased personnel and personnel related costs  primarily non cash stock based compensation expenses  and increased spending due to expanded marketing programs 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but continue to decline as a percentage of revenues as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the home market and to support growth in international markets 
research and development our research and development expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change research and development research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at for both and the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and personnel related costs  primarily non cash stock based compensation expense and increased project related spending 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in clinical trials expenses primarily related to our nocturnal ide as we completed the study in february for the near term  we expect research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenues as we seek to further enhance and improve the reliability of our system one and related products and as we continue with our freedom study  which is designed to quantify the clinical benefits and costs of daily home therapy administered to medicare patients using the system one versus conventional thrice weekly dialysis 
distribution our distribution expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change system one segment in center segment total distribution distribution expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to for versus for distribution expenses for the system one segment decreased as a percentage of revenues to for versus for  due primarily to efficiencies gained from economies of scale resulting from increased business volume  improved product reliability of our system one and pureflow sl hardware and better pricing obtained from carriers 
distribution expenses as a percentage of revenues for the in center segment 
table of contents increased slightly to for versus for  due primarily to increased delivery costs for certain products shipped from our international manufacturing locations to our customers 
we expect that distribution expenses in absolute dollars will fluctuate modestly from period to period driven in large part by changes in fuel prices but  overall  we expect distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume and improved reliability of system one equipment 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at for both and the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased personnel and personnel related costs  primarily non cash stock based compensation expenses 
these increases were offset by lower spending on corporate support functions  including consulting and other professional services  due to our continued initiatives to control costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as we continue to leverage our existing infrastructure 
other income and expense interest income is derived primarily from investments in money market funds 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on investments 
interest expense decreased million during compared to  due primarily to prepayment and other transaction fees of million incurred during to pay off the entire debt obligation owed under our credit and security agreement with general electric capital corporation  or ge 
the change in other expense during both periods is derived primarily by foreign currency gains and losses 
provision for foreign income taxes the provision for income taxes of million in and million in relates primarily to the profitable operations of certain of our foreign entities

table of contents the change in other expense during both periods is derived primarily by foreign currency gains and losses 
the change in fair value of the warrants issued on may  and august  in connection with the private placement resulted in the recognition of a million gain and the change in fair value of the obligation entered into on may  in connection with the second tranche resulted in the recognition of a million loss during the obligation relating to the second tranche was settled on august  and the fair value on settlement of million was recorded in equity 
the exercise price of the warrants was fixed at per share on december  based on the company s ability to achieve over  esrd patients prescribed to receive therapy using the system one 
as a result  beginning january   the warrants were classified in equity and thereafter  no longer result in the recognition of changes in fair value in earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k for further information 
provision for foreign income taxes the provision for income taxes of million in and million in relates primarily to the profitable operations of certain of our foreign entities 
liquidity and capital resources we have operated at a loss since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  product development and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and ongoing revenues 
historically  our business was fairly capital intensive due to the manner in which we placed our system one equipment in the home market 
prior to  the significant majority of our system one placements in the home market were made under a rental model rather than an outright sale 
over the last three years  we have increased the number of system ones we have sold versus rented  and in  the significant majority of our system one placements in the home market were made under a sale versus rental model 
shifting our customers to an equipment purchase versus rental model allows us to recover the cost of our products upon initial sale rather than over an extended period of time  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
a number of our home market customers  including davita  have committed to purchase  rather than rent  the significant majority of their future system one equipment requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to expand or sustain the percentage of our equipment placements that are purchased rather than rented 
other significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are our ability to continue to effectively manage our field equipment assets and working capital and execute upon cost reduction initiatives to lower product cost 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were positive due to improvements in net loss versus and a million one time customer prepayment on first quarter orders 
while we continue to make progress in improving our cash flows from operating activities  we expect cash flows from operating activities in the near term to fluctuate between negative and positive on a quarterly basis  primarily due to changes in working capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to improve cash flows from operating activities or whether we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 
we believe  based on current projections and the current nature of our business  that we have the required resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements 
our ability to and the rate at which we continue to improve cash flows from operating activities will depend on many factors  including growing revenues  continued improvements in gross margins  leverage of our operating infrastructure and continued sale versus rental of a significant percentage of our system one equipment 
we materially improved our cash position in through the completion of the registered sale of  shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with canaccord genuity 
we received proceeds of million  net of related expenses  from this offering 
the shares issued in this 
table of contents offering were registered under a registration statement on form s  which became effective on november  this registration statement allows for the potential future registered sale by us of various other equity and debt securities  although we have no current plans to make such a future offering 
we have two material debt instruments 
in may  we entered into a term loan and security agreement with asahi 
the million term loan bears interest at a rate of per annum  with fifty percent of such interest being deferred until the maturity date on may  principal is payable in one balloon payment at maturity 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in the event the term loan reaches maturity  asahi may require that all of the principal and interest on the term loan that is unpaid as of the maturity date be converted into shares of our common stock  with the number of shares to be determined based upon the average closing stock price of our common stock during the thirty business days preceding the maturity date  subject to certain conditions 
we used million of the proceeds to pay off the entire debt obligation  including prepayment and other transaction fees  owed under our prior credit and security agreement with general electric capital corporation 
the term loan and security agreement with asahi includes certain affirmative covenants including timely filings and limitations on contingent debt obligations and sales of assets 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the term loan and security agreement also contains customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants  material adverse effects  and bankruptcy 
in the event we fail to satisfy our covenants  or otherwise go into default  asahi has a number of remedies  including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness  subject to the rights of svb s senior security interest 
any of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have the flexibility under our term loan with asahi to seek up to million in additional debt at market interest rates 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  for a million revolving line of credit with a maturity date of april  this agreement is secured by all or substantially all of our assets 
in connection with this agreement  we amended our term loan and security agreement with asahi to provide for certain amendments  including granting to asahi junior liens on certain of our assets for so long as the agreement with svb remains outstanding 
upon termination of all obligations under that facility  asahi s security will revert to a security in all assets other than cash  bank accounts  accounts receivable  field equipment and inventory 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to two percentage points above the prime rate initial prime rate of 
pursuant to the agreement  we have agreed to certain financial covenants relating to liquidity requirements and adjusted ebitda  as defined in the agreement with svb 
the agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants  material adverse effect and bankruptcy 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants  there were no outstanding borrowings and we had nearly all of the million credit commitment available for borrowing under the agreement 
in may  we entered into a million private placement agreement to sell an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the exercise price of the warrants was fixed at per share on december  based on the company s ability to achieve over  esrd patients prescribed to receive therapy using the system one 
the warrants have a term of years and expire on may  and august  for the first and second tranches respectively 
the warrants also contain a net share settlement feature that is available to investors in the private placement once the underlying shares are registered 
additional provisions require the company  in the event of a change of control  to pay promptly to the warrant holder an amount calculated by the black scholes option pricing formula 
such payment is required to be in cash or shares in the same proportion that other stockholders receive in such change of control transaction 
we maintain postemployment benefit plans for employees in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the plans provide lump sum benefits  payable based on statutory regulations for voluntary or involuntary termination 
where required  we obtain an annual actuarial valuation of the benefit plans 
we have recorded a liability of 
table of contents million as other long term liabilities at december  for costs associated with these plans 
the expense recorded in connection with these plans was not significant during  and the following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities foreign exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents net cash flow net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during  which represents a million improvement in cash flows from operating activities from the improvement during was attributable to three main factors 
first  we improved our net loss after adjustments for non cash charges as we continue to increase revenue and improve gross margins 
second  net deferred revenues increased million during as a result of the increase in the number of customers who chose to purchase  rather than rent  the system one equipment  which included amortization of deferred revenues totaling million during currently  the majority of our system one placements in the home market are done under a sales versus rental model 
finally  working capital requirements increased  primarily due to inventory requirements  partially offset by a million one time customer prepayment on first quarter orders 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million during the decrease in net cash used in operating activities during was primarily due to a decrease in our net loss after adjustments for non cash charges as we continue to reduce product costs  and a decrease in inventory purchases for the production and placement of system one and pureflow sl hardware as a result of reduced costs  improved reliability and improved management of our field equipment assets 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of units with our customers increased million during  to support the growing number of patients using the system one 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of units with our customers decreased million during  due to improvements made in managing our field equipment assets  enabling us to continue to add patients without adding additional field equipment 
non cash transfers from field equipment to deferred costs of revenues increased million during and decreased million during this activity fluctuates based on the number of customers who choose to purchase rather than rent and customer conversions to purchasing from renting our system one equipment 
net cash used in investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for manufacturing operations and capital improvements to our facilities  research and development and information technology 
during  net cash used in investing activities included million of proceeds from short term investments and decreases in other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million during and decreased by million during net cash provided by financing activities during included net proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million and million of proceeds from stock option and stock purchase plans offset by cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock that were surrendered in payment for minimum required withholding taxes due on issuance of shares of our common stock under our bonus plan and vesting of restricted stock awards under our performance share plan 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of borrowings under our term loan with asahi offset by million in fees paid in connection with the asahi debt issuance  million in repayments of borrowings under our credit and security 
table of contents agreement with ge and a million amendment fee paid in connection with the march  amendment to our credit and security agreement with ge 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of additional borrowings under our credit and security agreement with ge and million net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and the effect those commitments are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total one year years years years debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt obligations include the aggregate outstanding principal amount under our million term loan with asahi and related deferred interest and estimated interest payments 
our purchase obligations include purchase commitments for system one components  primarily for equipment  blood tubing sets  needles  and fluids pursuant to contractual agreements with several of our suppliers that are in the normal course of business 
certain of these commitments may be extended and or canceled at our option 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales and services when earned 
revenues are recognized when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the product has been shipped or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and 
table of contents whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
certain agreements with distributors allow for product returns and credits 
for shipment of product sold to distributors  revenue is recognized at the time of sale if a reasonable estimate of future returns or refunds can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of future returns or refunds cannot be made  we recognize revenue using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue and related costs of revenue is deferred until the final resale of such products to end customers 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  in many agreements we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discounts for early payment 
rebates and discounts are recorded as a reduction of sales and trade accounts receivable  based on our best estimate of the amount of probable future rebate or discount on current sales 
system one segment we derive revenue in the home market from the sales of hemodialysis therapy to customers in which the customer either purchases or rents the system one and or pureflow sl hardware and purchases a specified number of disposable products and  in some instances  service 
for customers that purchase the system one and pureflow sl hardware  we must determine whether a the equipment has stand alone value and b the fair value of the undelivered items  typically the disposables and  in most instances service  can be determined 
if either criteria is not met  which is generally the case  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our remaining obligation and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment are amortized over the same period as the related revenue  while disposable products revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon delivery 
if both criteria are met  then the items are accounted for separately as delivered 
under the rental arrangements revenue is recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to binding customer purchase orders and fixed payment terms 
in the critical care market  we structure sales of the system one as direct product sales and have no significant post delivery obligations with the exception of standard warrant obligations 
we recognize revenue from direct product sales at the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
our contracts for the system one in the critical care market provide for training  technical support and warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the service revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
in center segment in the in center segment  nearly all sales to end users are structured through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
some of our distribution contracts for the in center segment contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing discounts at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on an estimated forecast of product demand for each of our existing product configurations 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase 
table of contents commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances as well as regulatory and quality manufacturing guidelines that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment field equipment consists of equipment being utilized under disposable based rental agreements as well as service pool cyclers 
service pool cyclers are cyclers owned and maintained by us that are swapped for cyclers that need repairs or maintenance by us while being rented or owned by a patient 
we continually monitor the number of cyclers in the service pool  as well as cyclers that are in transit or otherwise not being used by a patient  and assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for such equipment 
we also review field equipment carrying value for reasonableness 
we consider factors such as actual equipment disposals and our ability to verify the equipment s existence in the field to identify lost equipment 
charges for lost equipment are included in distribution expenses 
we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life 
we review the estimated useful life of our field equipment periodically for reasonableness and make changes when appropriate 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life include industry practice and the typical amortization periods used for like equipment  the frequency and scope of service returns and the impact of historical and planned future design improvements 
accounting for stock based awards stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period  based on the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including the expected term of our stock options  volatility of our stock  expected dividends  risk free interest rates over the expected term of the options and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our performance based programs  we make assumptions principally related to the number of awards that are expected to vest after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met 
valuation of intangibles and other long lived assets for our long lived assets including intangible assets  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results  significant negative industry factors and significant changes in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long lived assets 
if an impairment review is triggered  we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
goodwill may be considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of our reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
our reporting units are our system one and in center operating segments 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments including the identification of reporting units and determination of the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
we estimate reporting unit fair value using a discounted cash flow 
table of contents approach which requires the use of assumptions and judgments including estimates of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates 
our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values of reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we periodically assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the position changes  if the matter is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation expires  the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change  resolution or expiration occurs 
we file federal  state and foreign tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
we have accumulated significant losses since our inception in since the net operating losses may potentially be utilized in future years to reduce taxable income  all of our tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
our investments are subject to changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
foreign currency exposure we operate a manufacturing and research facility in germany as well as manufacturing facilities in italy and mexico 
we purchase materials for those facilities and pay our employees at those facilities in euros and pesos 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar  including the euro and peso 
we also have contracts with key suppliers that expose us to foreign currency risks  including the euro and the thai baht 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
although it is possible to do so and we may in the future  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency transactions since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
a movement in the euro  peso and baht would have an overall impact to the statement of operations of approximately million for  which would have been approximately of total annual expenses
