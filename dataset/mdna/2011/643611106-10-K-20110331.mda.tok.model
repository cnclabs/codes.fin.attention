item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview effective september   the company completed the acquisition of certain entities  mineral interests and related assets through entities named carl e 
smith  inc  a west virginia corporation  two of its affiliates  carl e 
smith petroleum  inc and carl e 
smith real estate  inc and other privately owned related assets collectively cesi 
immediately after the acquisition  all of the acquired entities and assets were merged into carl e 
smith  inc  the name of which was changed to mountaineer state energy  inc mountaineer which became a wholly owned subsidiary of nce 
the assets acquired include producing gas wells  non producing wells and related equipment  mineral leases covering  acres located in athens and meigs counties in ohio as well as calhoun  jackson and roane counties in west virginia 
in addition to the wells and mineral leases  the acquisition included a complex covering approximately acres of land with  square feet of office and storage buildings  an adjacent acre site with a stall horse barn  machinery and equipment in excess of the needs of the gas operation and approximately million in cash 
nce has evaluated the excess equipment and since the acquisition has sold currently plans on selling certain excess land and equipment not needed for current or planned future operations 
the cash portion of the asset acquisition totaling approximately million was paid from existing working capital held by nce 
as part of the acquisition the company entered into certain non interest bearing long term obligations which will paid out over the next years 
the company has evaluated the above notes and after factoring in certain offsets provided for in the agreement has valued the above obligations at  at december  as of december   the company leased one independent living community in oregon  with a capacity of residents 
a number of years ago the company has owned  leased and operated assisted living and retirement communities throughout the united states 
during that period of time the company has both acquired and sold over seventy communities 
the property in oregon is a holdover from that time period 
while not an integral part of our business plan the one remaining facility is profitable and it is anticipated that it will remain a part of the company s operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based upon the company s historical experience  current trends and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are more significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
oil and gas property accounting the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs  geological expenditures  dry hole costs  tangible and intangible development costs and direct internal costs are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas properties when incurred 
the full cost method requires the company to calculate quarterly  by cost center  a ceiling  or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet 
to the extent capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties subject to amortization  the cost of properties not being amortized  and the related tax amounts  such excess capitalized costs are charged to expense 
beginning december   full cost companies use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the month period preceding the calculation date to calculate the future net revenues of proved reserves 
prior to december   companies used the price in effect at the calculation date and had the option  under certain circumstances  to elect to use subsequent commodity prices if they increased after the calculation date 
the company assesses any unproved oil and gas properties on an annual basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
the company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment of unproved properties not subject to amortization  the associated costs incurred to date for such properties are then included in unproved properties subject to amortization 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is based on an analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant  customer or other debtor and the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor 
management s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change 
deferred tax assets significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carry forwards 
at december   the company had a deferred tax asset due to tax deductions available to it in future years 
however  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would be realized  a valuation allowance was established 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  and  at december  new concept s principal sources of cash are property operations  sales of oil and gas  and proceeds from sales of assets 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was  in   in and  in net cash provided by used in investing activities was  in   in and million in net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in   in and million in the million used in was the result of the payment of related party debt of million  partially offset by receipt of million for the issuance of  shares of common stock 
results of operations fiscal as compared to revenues and operating expenses total revenues for totaled million compared to million in the primary reason for the increase is higher occupancy in our retirement facility 
operating expenses totaled million for compared to million for in  oil and gas operating costs totaled million compared to million in due to the cost reductions and efficiency in well production 
also in  the company recorded accretion of discount related to its asset retirement obligation of  real estate operating expenses remained relatively constant 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased from million to  due primarily to the write down of receivables of approximately  and the accrual of  in interest and penalties on unpaid taxes in that were one time in nature and did not reoccur in interest income expense interest income decreased approximately  from to due to the reduction of the principle during interest expense remained relatively unchanged from to other income expense other income expense changed from  in income for to a  expense in the company had a write off of  for an attempted acquisition that did not occur 
fiscal as compared to revenues and operating expenses total revenues for totaled million compared to million in the primary reason for the increase is the acquisition of the oil and gas operations in september fiscal reflects a full twelve months of operating revenue for the oil and gas operations  while reflects only four months of such revenue 
oil and gas revenue did not increase as much as may have been anticipated due to the expiration of a fixed price contract in the first quarter of for the remainder of the year  gas was sold at the spot price  which was substantially less than the original contract price 
revenue for the retirement facility totaled approximately million for and operating expenses totaled million for compared to million for in  oil and gas operating costs totaled million compared to  in due to the acquisition of the oil and gas operations described above 
in  the company recorded a non cash charge to operations of million for impairment of natural gas and oil properties  pursuant to the results of the full cost ceiling test 
also in  the company recorded accretion of discount related to its asset retirement obligation of  real estate operating expenses remained relatively constant 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  to million  due primarily to the write down of receivables of approximately  and the accrual of  in interest and penalties on unpaid taxes  offset by reductions in salaries and wages of approximately  interest income interest income decreased approximately  from to due to the reduction interest rate on portions of the notes receivable from eight percent to the prime rate plus two percent during interest expense interest expense for decreased approximately  due to the pay off of million of related party debt in the first quarter of gain on sale of assets in  the company sold its investment in mineral rights in the fayetteville shale for a gain of approximately million 
no gain or loss was recorded on sales of assets in other income other income decreased from  in to  in other income in is primarily due to cash received from receivables that were previously fully reserved 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of the company s debt is financed at fixed rates of interest 
therefore  the company has minimal risk from exposure to changes in interest rates
