item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a  interest rates  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with our financing arrangements 
economic conditions general economic conditions may continue to impact our revenue and operating results according to the national bureau of economic research  the united states economy was in a recession from december until june it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  auto sales and employment  were in decline before december  and have still not recovered to pre recession levels 
 and revenue  operating results and cash flows were significantly impacted by the recession and its aftermath 
the duration and depth of an economic recession  and pace of economic recovery  in markets in which we operate may influence our future results 
operating revenue our revenue may not return to historical levels a significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising 
the demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic activity  both locally and nationally 
operating revenue in most categories decreased in  and and may decrease in the future 
such decreases may not be offset by growth in advertising in other categories  such as digital revenue which  until  had been rising significantly and began to rise again in historically  newspaper publishing has been viewed as a cost effective method of delivering various forms of advertising 
there can be no guarantee that this historical perception will guide future decisions on the part of advertisers 
web sites and applications for mobile devices distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity 
as a result  audience attention and advertising spending are shifting and may continue to shift from traditional media to digital media 
we expect that advertisers will allocate greater portions of their future budgets to digital media  which can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media through pay for performance and keyword targeted advertising 
if our efforts to adapt to evolving technological developments in the media industry are unsuccessful  or if we fail to correctly anticipate shifts in audience demand and digital media trends  we may be unable to provide the services  media and content that audiences and potential audiences in our markets prefer and we may be unable to provide the returns that our advertisers seek 
to the extent that advertisers shift advertising expenditures to other media outlets  including those on the internet  the profitability of our business may continue to be impacted 
the rates we charge for advertising are  in part  related to the size of the audience of our publications and digital products 
there is significant competition for readers and viewers from other media 
our business may be adversely affected to the extent individuals decide to obtain news  entertainment  classified listings and local shopping information from internet based or other media  to the exclusion of our outlets for such information 
retail advertising many advertisers  including major retail store chains  automobile manufacturers and dealers  banks and telecommunications companies  have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last several years  and some have gone out of business  effectively reducing the number of brand names under which the merged entities operate 
our retail revenue is also being impacted by the current economic environment 
for example  a decline in the housing market negatively impacts retail advertising related to home improvement  furniture and home electronics 
classified advertising classified advertising is the category that has been most significantly impacted by the current economic environment 
in employment classified advertising  including both print and digital  declined as unemployment increased 
this trend began to reverse in and employment revenue grew in automotive classified advertising revenue declined in and  due to industry wide issues affecting certain domestic auto manufacturers and overall weak economic conditions 
in  and real estate classified advertising also suffered declines due primarily to cyclical issues  such as declining sale prices and high levels of unsold homes  affecting the residential real estate market nationally 
see item  advertising  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with advertising revenue 
circulation although our overall audience is stable and our circulation unit results have historically benchmarked favorably to national averages  as compiled by the abc  circulation unit sales have nonetheless been declining fractionally for several years 
the possibility exists that future circulation price increases may be difficult to accomplish as a result of future declines in circulation unit sales  and that price decreases may be necessary to retain or grow circulation unit volume 
we are maintaining strong audiences through stable newspaper readership and rapid digital audience growth 
nonetheless  declines in circulation unit sales could also adversely impact advertising revenue 
in addition  as audience attention increasingly focuses on digital media  circulation of our newspapers may be adversely affected  which may decrease circulation revenue and exacerbate declines in print advertising 
if we are not successful in growing our digital businesses to offset declines in revenues from our print products  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
see item  audiences  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with circulation revenue 
operating expenses we may not be able to reduce future expenses to offset potential revenue declines we reduced cash costs ie  compensation  newsprint and ink  other operating expenses and workforce adjustments  or more than  since such expense reductions are not expected to significantly impact our ability to deliver advertising and content to our customers 
as a result of the significant reductions of our cost structure we have achieved since  future cost reductions will be more difficult to accomplish 
cash costs are expected to decrease in on a comparable basis from the level  excluding a rd week of business activity in newsprint comprises a significant amount of our operating costs 
see item  newsprint and item a  commodities included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with changes in newsprint costs 
in addition  technological developments and any changes we make to our business may require significant capital investments 
we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products  services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure 
as a result  our digital business could suffer 
we may incur additional non cash impairment charges we have significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets 
in and  we recorded substantial impairment charges to reduce the value of certain of these assets 
should general economic  market or business conditions decline  and have a negative impact on our stock price or projected future cash flows  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future 
see item  critical accounting policies  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with such assets 
sustained increases in funding requirements of our pension and postretirement obligations may reduce the cash available for our business our pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities  many of which were affected by the disruption in the credit and capital markets in  and future volatility and disruption in the stock and bond markets could cause further declines in the asset values of our pension plans 
in addition  a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the liability for pension obligations could result in increased future contributions 
if either occurs  we may need to make additional cash contributions above what is currently estimated  which could reduce the cash available for our business 
moreover  under the pension protection act of  continued losses of asset values may necessitate accelerated funding of pension plans in the future to meet minimum federal statutory requirements 
equity capital a decrease in our stock price may limit the ability to trade our stock or for the company to raise equity capital as of july   our common stock traded at an average day closing market price of less than per share 
under the nyse listing standards  if our common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and total market capitalization  our common stock could be removed from the nyse and traded in the over the counter market 
in july  the nyse first notified us that our common stock did not meet the nyse continued listing standard due to the failure to maintain an adequate share price 
under the nyse rules related to the average share price  lee common stock is allowed to continue to be listed during a cure period 
continued listing is subject to ongoing reassessment by the nyse and the return to compliance with all quantitative listing requirements  which would require an increase in the average closing price to per share or per share if the refinancing of our debt discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  is consumated 
we are currently operating under an nyse approved plan to address those quantitative listing requirements as to which we are non compliant  and expect those issues to be successfully addressed within the time frames required under the nyse rules 
we may be able to mitigate the effect of a low stock price in the future through implementation of a reverse stock split 
other our operations will be subject to the uncertainties of the bankruptcy process while our voluntary  prepackaged refinancing plan has been approved by substantially all of our creditors and we expect to complete the filing process expeditiously  negative events or publicity associated with our process and events during the proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with customers  vendors or employees  which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
further  our ability to obtain court approval of routine motions that will allow us to operate our business normally is not within our control 
the voluntary  prepackaged refinancing plan is also subject to certain closing conditions including  but not limited to  achieving a minimum level of liquidity  all of which must be satisfied in order for the company to emerge from the chapter process 
cybersecurity risks could harm our ability to operate effectively in  of our advertising revenue was obtained from advertising in our digital products and one of our businesses provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for other companies 
we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations 
such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks 
we have preventive systems and processes in place to protect against the risk of cyber incidents 
prolonged system outages or a cyber incident that would be undetected for an extended period could reduce our digital revenue  increase our operating costs  or disrupt our operations 
we maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks

item legal proceedings in  a group of newspaper carriers filed suit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of california  claiming to be our employees and not independent contractors 
the plaintiffs seek relief related to alleged violations of various employment based statutes  and request punitive damages and attorneys fees 
in july  the trial court granted the plaintiffs petition for class certification 
we filed an interlocutory appeal which was denied 
after concluding discovery  we filed a motion to reverse the class certification ruling 
this motion is currently pending before the trial court 
the company denies the allegations of employee status  consistent with our past practices and industry standards  and will continue to vigorously contest the action  which is not covered by insurance 
at this time we are unable to predict whether the ultimate economic outcome  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole 
we are involved in a variety of other legal actions that arise in the normal course of business 
insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these other matters 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions  it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  we believe the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate our financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
we also believe such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income loss before depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets  curtailment gains and equity in earnings of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations excluding such non cash factors 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income loss and operating income loss margin  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands of dollars percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and other assets curtailment gains equity in earnings of associated companies reduction in investment in tni operating income loss nm nm adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude both unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information by identifying matters that are not indicative of core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share to income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth in item  included herein  under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures  if any  consummated in the current or prior year 
we believe such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in our revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
we own of tni and also own of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of our accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  we make a determination of the fair value of our business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
a non cash impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by us 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
we analyze goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of our intangible assets 
due primarily to the difference between our stock price and the per share carrying value of our net assets  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in and again in continued deterioration in our revenue and the weak economic environment were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
we concluded the fair value of our business did not exceed the carrying value of our net assets in and as a result  we recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets in and additional pretax  non cash charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of tni 
we also recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment in  and we recorded deferred income tax benefits related to these charges 
a summary of impairment charges is included in the table below thousands of dollars goodwill nonamortized intangible assets amortizable intangible assets property and equipment reduction in investment in tni we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
we also periodically evaluate our determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact our cash flows 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
future decreases in our market value  or significant differences in revenue  expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value  could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans we evaluate our liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors  as applicable 
if we used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan funded status and may necessitate additional contributions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
recent changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions can result in additional variability in our effective income tax rate 
we file income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  we are subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
we have considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believe our positions taken regarding our filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
we do not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related digital product 
circulation revenue is recorded over the print or digital product subscription term or as newspapers are individually sold 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for print or digital products or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks we are self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of our employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
we accrue our estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
our accrued reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
an increasing frequency of large claims  deterioration in overall claim experience or changes in federal or state laws affecting our liability for such claims could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment  which provides new guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
this new guidance gives us  subject to certain conditions  the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
we adopted this guidance in  as permitted 
adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires additional disclosure related to the three level fair value hierarchy 
this new guidance requires us to disclose significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy and to disclose separately information related to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements classified as level the new guidance also clarifies previous disclosure requirements by increasing the level of disaggregation to the class level for investments and by requiring more disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques for fair value measurements in level and level adoption of asu occurs in two parts with the requirements to disclose purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements classified as level to occur in we adopted the remaining requirements of asu in  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

these changes were effective in october our digital sites attracted million unique visitors in the month of september  an increase of from a year ago  with approximately million page views

in  and  we made payments totaling   and  respectively  related to this provision 
the credit agreement also requires us to accelerate future payments under the a term loan in the amount of of our annual excess cash flow  as defined 
we do not anticipate making a payment related to excess cash flow 
we had no excess cash flow in or we had excess cash flow of approximately  in and  as a result  paid  originally due under the a term loan in the acceleration of such payments due to future asset sales or excess cash flow does not change the due dates of other a term loan payments prior to the april maturity

pulitzer may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding or reduce commitments under the pulitzer notes at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  upon proper notice and consent from the noteholders and the lenders  and subject to certain limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments 
the notes amendment provides for mandatory scheduled prepayments  including quarterly principal payments of  beginning on june  and an additional principal payment from restricted cash of  in october in  and  all payments due were made prior to the end of the previous fiscal quarter 
in addition to the scheduled payments  we are required to make mandatory payments under the pulitzer notes under certain other conditions

we made payments of  and  related to this provision in and  respectively 
the notes amendment establishes a reserve of restricted cash of up to  which was reduced to  in october to facilitate the liquidity of the operations of pulitzer 
all other previously existing restricted cash requirements were eliminated 
the notes amendment allocates a percentage of pulitzer quarterly excess cash flow as defined between pulitzer and the credit parties and requires prepayments to the noteholders under certain specified events 
principal prepayments of  and  were made under the pulitzer notes from excess cash flow of pulitzer in and  respectively 
an additional payment of  was made in november the pulitzer notes contain certain covenants and conditions including the maintenance  by pulitzer  of the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda limit of at september   as defined in the guaranty agreement  minimum net worth and limitations on the incurrence of other debt 
the notes amendment added a requirement to maintain minimum interest coverage limit of at september   as defined 
the notes amendment amended the pulitzer notes and the guaranty agreement covenants to take into account economic conditions and the changes to amortization of debt noted above 
at september   pulitzer was in compliance with such covenants 
further  the notes amendment added and amended other covenants including limitations or restrictions on additional debt  distributions  loans  advances  investments  acquisitions  dispositions and mergers 
such covenants require that substantially all future cash flows of pulitzer are required to be directed first toward repayment of the pulitzer notes and that cash flows of pulitzer are largely segregated from those of the credit parties 
the credit agreement contains a cross default provision tied to the terms of the pulitzer notes and the pulitzer notes have limited cross default provisions tied to the terms of the credit agreement 
the purchase price allocation of pulitzer resulted in an increase in the value of the pulitzer notes in the amount of  which was recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
at september   the unaccreted balance totals  this amount is being accreted over the remaining life of the pulitzer notes  until april  as a reduction in interest expense using the interest method 
this accretion will not increase the principal amount due  or reduce the amount of interest to be paid  to the noteholders 
other in  we paid fees to the lenders and noteholders for the amendments and notes amendment which  along with the related legal and financial advisory expenses  totaled   of the fees were capitalized and are being expensed over the remaining term of the credit agreement and pulitzer notes  until april at september   we have total unamortized financing costs of  related to existing debt 
at september   our weighted average cost of debt is 
status of debt refinancing and liquidity at september   we had  outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and after consideration of the amendments and letters of credit  have approximately  available for future use 
including cash and restricted cash  our liquidity at september  totals  this liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows 
since february  we have satisfied all interest payments and substantially all principal payments due under our debt facilities with our cash flows 
in april  we announced a plan to offer to qualified institutional buyers  subject to market conditions   of first priority lien senior secured notes due in   of second priority lien senior secured notes due in and up to  shares of common stock 
the proceeds from the offerings  net of offering costs  would have been used to refinance the credit agreement and pulitzer notes 
as a result of market conditions  we terminated the offering process in may and charged  of related debt financing costs to expense in in september  we announced a plan to amend our current credit agreement and extend the april maturity in a structure of first and second lien debt 
the first lien debt will consist of a term loan of  along with a  revolving credit facility that is not expected to be drawn at closing 
the second lien debt will be a  term loan 
the first lien term loan will bear interest at libor plus  with a libor floor of 
principal payments for the first lien term loan will be required quarterly beginning in june and total  annually in the twelve month period ending march  increasing to  in the following twelve months and to  annually thereafter 
a quarterly cash flow sweep will also be used to reduce first lien debt 
covenants include a minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum total leverage ratio and capital expenditure limitation 
the maturity is in december interest on the revolving credit facility  when used  will be at libor plus  with a libor floor of 
the revolving credit facility will also support issuance of letters of credit 
the maturity is in december the second lien term loan will bear interest at and mature in april it requires no amortization and has no affirmative financial covenants 
lenders under the second lien term loan will share in the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock  an amount equal to of outstanding shares on a pro forma basis as of the closing date 
as a condition to the refinancing of the credit agreement  we were expected to refinance the remaining  of our current pulitzer notes debt with a separate  loan to be arranged in the leveraged loan or high yield markets 
subsequent credit market conditions did not allow for that debt to be refinanced on acceptable terms  and as a result  we chose to amend the pulitzer notes and extend the maturity with the existing noteholders 
under the agreement with the noteholders  which was announced in december  the amended pulitzer notes will carry an interest rate of  increasing in january and january of each year thereafter 
annual mandatory principal payments will total  per year 
a quarterly cash flow sweep will also be used to reduce the balance of the pulitzer notes 
covenants include a minimum ebitda ratio and capital expenditure limitation 
after consideration of unscheduled principal payments totaling  of which  were made in december  offset by  of non cash fees to be paid to the noteholders in the form of additional pulitzer notes debt  the amended pulitzer notes will have a balance of  at the closing of the transaction 
the maturity is in december substantially all of our assets will secure the debt  as is the case today 
our weighted average cost of debt will increase from at september  to approximately under the refinanced agreements 
mandatory annual principal payments will total  in cash payments to the lenders  noteholders and legal and professional fees are expected to total approximately  of which  was paid in   was charged to expense in and the remainder of which will be paid and charged to expense in upon consummation of the transactions 
in addition  previously capitalized financing costs of  at september  will be charged to expense in prior to  or upon consummation of  the transactions 
the terms of the amended agreements require that substantially all future cash flows be directed toward repayment of the credit agreement or pulitzer notes and that cash flows of pulitzer are largely segregated from those of the credit parties 
the credit agreement and pulitzer notes require lender or noteholder approval  respectively  for key changes  including extension of maturities 
because credit market conditions dictated the need to extend the pulitzer notes with current noteholders  we were not able to increase the pulitzer notes facility to  as discussed above 
consequently  we were unable to redeem the interests of the last of non consenting lenders under the credit agreement for cash 
as a result  we will make use of a voluntary  prepackaged filing under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on or about december  to effect the amendments to the credit agreement and pulitzer notes discussed above 
this process is not expected to have an adverse effect on our governance or operations 
immediately upon filing  we will request authority to pay all suppliers and other vendors without delay  which request is commonly approved in similar situations 
all our digital and print products will be published as usual and no employees will be impacted 
our owned equity interests in tucson  az and madison  wi are not included in the filing 
lender and noteholder balloting related to the chapter process is expected to be completed on or before december  we expect to complete the restructuring process quickly and without disruption to our business  likely in days or less from the date of filing 
we have received commitments for a  debtor in possession financing facility that will provide additional liquidity during the restructuring process and will  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  be converted into the revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement upon our emergence from chapter proceedings 
support agreements have been executed by of lenders under the credit agreement and of noteholders of the pulitzer notes and are in effect as of september  and december   respectively 
such support agreements require the lenders and noteholders to support the amendments to the credit agreement and pulitzer notes  respectively  contemplated in the prepackaged filing 
an amendment to the credit agreement to allow unscheduled principal payments on the pulitzer notes and to facilitate other aspects of the refinancing process was declared effective on december  we do not expect the refinancing process to affect the trading of our common stock on the nyse 
we are currently operating under an approved plan  which is subject to periodic reassessment by the nyse  to address non compliance issues  including the need to increase the average closing price of our common stock to per share 
since our refinancing process was not completed at the time of the filing of our annual report on form k  there is significant uncertainty about our ability to operate as a going concern 
accordingly  the opinion of our independent registered accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements contains explanatory going concern language 
our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain approval by the us bankruptcy court of the refinancing plan approved by creditors and to generate cash flows and maintain liquidity sufficient to service our debt 
there are numerous potential consequences under the credit agreement  and guaranty agreement and note agreement related to the pulitzer notes  if an event of default occurs and is not remedied 
many of those consequences are beyond our control  and the control of pulitzer and pd llc  respectively 
the occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the lenders or the noteholders  or both of them  to exercise their remedies under the credit agreement and the note and guaranty agreements  respectively  including  without limitation  the right to accelerate all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents 
in  we filed a form s shelf registration statement shelf with the sec  which has been declared effective 
the shelf gives us the flexibility to issue and publicly distribute various types of securities  including preferred stock  common stock  secured or unsecured debt securities  purchase contracts and units consisting of any combination of such securities  from time to time  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of  in july  the sec announced changes to the issuer eligibility rules which will require us to have a public float of at least  in order to use the shelf 
if the market price of our common stock increases sufficiently  the shelf may enable us to sell securities quickly and efficiently when market conditions are favorable or financing needs arise 
net proceeds from the sale of any securities must be used generally to reduce debt subject to conditions of existing debt agreements

we continuously evaluate price increases  productivity improvements  sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation 
changes in laws and regulations energy costs energy costs have become more volatile  and may increase in the future as a result of carbon emissions and other regulations being developed by the united states environmental protection agency 
health care costs the affordable care act was enacted into law in as a result  in we wrote off  of deferred income tax assets due to the loss of future tax deductions for providing retiree prescription drug benefits 
we expect the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  many of which have not been issued 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our current medical plans  such as higher maximum age for dependent coverage  elimination of lifetime benefit caps  and  free choice vouchers for certain lower income employees 
administrative costs are also likely to increase as a result of new compliance reporting 
new costs being imposed on other medical care businesses  such as health insurers  pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers  may be passed on to us in the form of higher costs 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases through changes in plan design 
we do not expect the affordable care act will have a significant impact on our postretirement medical benefit obligation liability 
income taxes certain states in which we operate are considering changes to their corporate income tax rates 
at this time  the impact of such changes cannot be determined 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  thousands of dollars payments or commitments due years nature of obligation total less than more than debt principal amount financial expense operating lease obligations capital expenditure commitments maturities of long term debt exclude the possible impact of acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement or pulitzer notes due to a future default under such agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates restricted cash and investments interest rate risk in our restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only in short term securities 
only us government and related securities are permitted 
debt our debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
our primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase or decrease to libor would  if in excess of libor minimums discussed more fully below  decrease or increase respectively  income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september  our debt under the credit agreement is subject to minimum interest rate levels of  and for borrowings for one month  three month and six month periods  respectively 
at september   all of our outstanding debt under the credit agreement is based on one month borrowing 
based on the difference between interest rates at the end of november and our minimum rate for one month borrowing  day libor would need to increase approximately basis points before our borrowing cost would begin to be impacted by an increase in interest rates 
since november   the full amount of the outstanding balance under the credit agreement has been subject to floating interest rates  as all interest rate swaps and collars expired or were terminated at or prior to that date 
at september   approximately of the principal amount of our debt is subject to floating interest rates 
we regularly evaluate alternatives to hedge the related interest rate risk 
certain of our interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
commodities certain materials used by us are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
we participate in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for the acquisition of newsprint 
we are also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
newsprint pricing has remained relatively flat since mid with some minor adjustments as west coast producers attempted to close the pricing gap with east coast suppliers 
north american newsprint producers continue to face declining domestic demand which has already forced them to shutter excess production and to pursue exports to fill current active production capacities 
a strong canadian currency and increased input costs  particularly recycled fiber  energy  and chemicals  have put significant financial pressure on higher cost producers 
future price changes  if any  will be influenced primarily by the balance between supply capacity and demand  domestic and export  in addition to the producers ability to mitigate input cost pressures 
the final extent of future price change announcements  if any  is subject to negotiations with each newsprint producer 
north america newsprint producers continue to deleverage under difficult market conditions 
the largest producer  resolute forest products  exited u 
s and canadian reorganization proceedings in december white birch paper holding company continues to operate under us and canadian financial reorganization protection after filing for protection in february sp newsprint filed for us financial reorganization protection in november white birch and sp newsprint continue to negotiate their exit plans 
a per tonne price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of tni and mni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
we manage significant newsprint inventories  which may help to mitigate the impact of future price increases 
sensitivity to changes in value our fixed rate debt consists of the pulitzer notes  which are not traded on an active market and held by a small group of noteholders 
coupled with the volatility of substantially all domestic credit markets that exists we are unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of our fixed rate debt from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  could be significant
