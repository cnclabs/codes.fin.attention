item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the subheading japan earthquake and tsunami and thailand flooding  which is incorporated herein by reference 
the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions that could damage the company s reputation  business operations  and financial conditions 
the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions 
these may be caused by natural disasters  accidents  power disruptions  telecommunications failures  acts of terrorism or war  computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  or similar events or disruptions 
system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate  and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company s online stores and services  preclude retail store transactions  compromise company or customer data  and result in delayed or cancelled orders 
system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products  delivery of online services  transactions processing and financial reporting 
the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems  which could damage the company s reputation  business partner and customer relationships  and access to online stores and services 
such breaches could subject the company to significant reputational  financial  legal  and operational consequences 
the company s business requires it to use and store customer  employee  and business partner personally identifiable information pii 
this may include names  addresses  phone numbers  email addresses  contact preferences  tax identification numbers  and payment account information 
although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries  the company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed 
the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems 
the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data 
these security measures may be compromised as a result of third party security breaches  employee error  malfeasance  faulty password management  or other irregularity  and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts 
third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names  passwords or other sensitive information  which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems 
to help protect customers and the company  the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances  which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 
the company devotes significant resources to network security  data encryption  and other security measures to protect its systems and data  but these security measures cannot provide absolute security 
the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data 
moreover  if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii  the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the company s products and services could decrease 
the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws  rules  policies and other obligations regarding data protection 
the company is subject to federal  state and international laws relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of pii 
in many cases  these laws apply not only to third party transactions  but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries  and among the company  its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations 
several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices 
noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability 
the company s privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website 
any failure by the company  its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policies or with other federal  state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors 
under these rules and obligations  if information is compromised  the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties 
in addition  if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards  even if no customer information is compromised  the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels 
the company s software  accessories  and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products 
gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions  pricing and configuration changes  and component  warranty  and other cost fluctuations 
the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners 
in addition  the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages  as well as overall profitability  may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product  geographic or channel mix  new products  component cost increases  strengthening us dollar  or price competition 
the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand 
furthermore  the company sells more products from time to time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  issues with new product introductions  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s logistics  components supply  or manufacturing partners  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s stock price is subject to volatility 
the company s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility 
additionally  the stock market as a whole has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations 
if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline  which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations 
compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations  such as import and export requirements  anti corruption laws  tax laws  foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions  data privacy requirements  environmental laws  labor laws  and anti competition regulations  increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 
although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations  a violation by the company s employees  contractors  or agents could nevertheless occur 
the consequences of such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including  but not limited to  economic and labor conditions  increased duties  taxes and other costs  political instability  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 
margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including duties  tariffs and antidumping penalties 
the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets 
there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide 
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing  potentially reducing demand for the company s products 
in some circumstances  due to competition or other reasons  the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar s strengthening  or at all  which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
conversely  a strengthening of foreign currencies  while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments  thereby limiting the benefit 
additionally  strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies  thus adversely affecting gross margins 
the company has used derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward and option contracts  to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 
the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 
although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  any significant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
given the global nature of its business  the company has both domestic and international investments 
credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity  credit deterioration  financial results  economic risk  political risk  sovereign risk or other factors 
as a result  the value and liquidity of the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable  vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers  wholesalers  retailers and value added resellers 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited 
cellular network carriers accounted for a significant portion of the company s trade receivables as of september  the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the company s non trade receivables as of september  in addition  the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components 
while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments  there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of business  and additional claims may arise in the future 
results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and  regardless of the merit of the claims  litigation may be expensive  time consuming  disruptive to the company s operations  and distracting to management 
in recognition of these considerations  the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 
although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote  if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations  the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
further  such an outcome could result in significant compensatory  punitive or trebled monetary damages  disgorgement of revenue or profits  remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 
changes in the company s tax rates  the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results 
the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the company s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties the company s headquarters are located in cupertino  california 
as of september   the company owned or leased approximately million square feet of building space  primarily in the us  and to a lesser extent  in europe  japan  canada  and the asia pacific regions

the company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business 
the company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products 
item legal proceedings as of september   the end of the annual period covered by this report  the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below  as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss  or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual  with respect to loss contingencies 
however  the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty 
therefore  although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote  if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations  the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
see the risk factors the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 
and unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company

japan earthquake and tsunami and thailand flooding on march   the northeast coast of japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami  with continuing aftershocks 
these geological events have caused significant damage in the region  including severe damage to nuclear power plants  and have impacted japan s power and other infrastructure as well as its economy 
certain of the company s suppliers are located in japan  and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in japan in the production of its products 
to the extent that component production has been affected  the company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures 
the company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of unless conditions worsen  including  but not limited to  power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants 
beyond the first quarter of  uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power  the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure 
thus  there is a risk that the company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products and or price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
in addition  in recent months several regions of thailand have experienced severe flooding  causing damage to infrastructure  housing and factories 
a number of the company s suppliers are located in thailand 
as with japan  to the extent that component production has been affected  the company will work to obtain alternative sources of supply or implement other measures 
based on the company s current assessment of the situation  it does not believe this event will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of  however  because the situation in thailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  valuation and impairment of marketable securities  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  digital content and applications  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products  software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware  and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products  ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality  undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software  and undelivered non software services  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
for sales of iphone  ipad  apple tv  for sales of ipod touch beginning in june  and for sales of mac beginning in june  the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers 
in june  the company announced it would begin providing various non software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services  revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps 
amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices  which range from to months 
the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment 
the company s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change  including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non software services or the estimated lives of the related devices  or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors  the company s esp for software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change 
if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change  the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also change 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s policy requires that  if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for customer incentive programs  the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired  which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  the company evaluates  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and the company s intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell  the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis 
the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired  could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs  which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded 
the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods up to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in note  commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss  or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual  with respect to loss contingencies 
however  the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty 
therefore  although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote  if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations  the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

gross margin gross margin for the three years ended september   are as follows in millions  except gross margin percentages net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin percentage the gross margin percentage in was  compared to in this year over year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs 
the gross margin percentage in was compared to in this year over year decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures  including ipad  partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone  which had a higher gross margin than the company average 
the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods  as compared to levels achieved during  largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers  and potential future component cost and other cost increases 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage are forward looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including  but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i  item a  risk factors under the subheading future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities  which is incorporated herein by reference 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components  as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins 
in response to these competitive pressures  the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions  which would adversely affect gross margins 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
due to the company s significant international operations  financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three years ended september   are as follows in millions  except for percentages research and development percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales research and development expense r d r d expense increased million or to billion in compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded r d activities

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
the internal revenue service the irs has completed its field audit of the company s federal income tax returns for the years through and proposed certain adjustments 
the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office 
the irs is currently examining the years through all irs audit issues for years prior to have been resolved 
in addition  the company is subject to audits by state  local  and foreign tax authorities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

the company believes its existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs  capital asset purchases  outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next months 
the company s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
as of september  and september   billion and billion  respectively  of the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollar denominated holdings 
amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us capital assets the company s capital expenditures were billion during  consisting of approximately million for retail store facilities and billion for other capital expenditures  including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  real estate for the future development of the company s second corporate campus  and other corporate facilities and infrastructure 
the company s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during were billion  of which million relates to retail store facilities 
the company anticipates utilizing approximately billion for capital expenditures during  including approximately million for retail store facilities and approximately billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  and corporate facilities and infrastructure  including information systems hardware  software and enhancements 
during  the company expects to open about new retail stores  approximately three quarters of which will be located outside of the us off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company 
the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september  and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in millions total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due in more than years operating leases purchase obligations other obligations total lease commitments the company s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years 
leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to years  the majority of which are for years  and often contain multi year renewal options 
as of september   the company s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were billion  of which billion related to leases for retail space 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers the company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods up to days 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
as of september   the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of billion 
other obligations other outstanding obligations were billion as of september   and were comprised mainly of commitments under long term supply agreements to make additional inventory component prepayments and to acquire capital equipment  commitments to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  and commitments related to advertising  research and development  internet and telecommunications services and other obligations 
the company s other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities  gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties 
as of september   the company had non current deferred tax liabilities of billion 
additionally  as of september   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of billion and an additional million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september  or september  the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers 
under these agreements  the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim 
however  the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations  and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
further  the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the fair value of those securities  as well as costs associated with hedging 
the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investment policy generally requires investments to be investment grade  with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures  typically for up to six months 
however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions
