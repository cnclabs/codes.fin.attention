on april  that subsidiary has one wholly owned subsidiary  paso rico usa inc  incorporated on august  in the state of wyoming  usa which subsequently changed its name to rare element resources  inc on february  narrative description of business the company s business is the acquisition  exploration and development of mineral properties 
the company s principal property is the bear lodge property located in northeastern wyoming  usa 
this property contains the bear lodge ree project  a large disseminated ree deposit  as well as the sundance gold project  extensive gold occurrences 
the bear lodge property was acquired through the july reverse takeover acquisition of rare element holdings ltd 
formerly paso rico resources ltd  which originally had an option to acquire full ownership of the property through exploration expenditures on the property before the reverse takeover by rare element  and had obtained ownership in september the company is exploring the bear lodge ree project and  as of june   had expended  on exploration

recent corporate developments the following significant corporate developments occurred during our fiscal year ended june  incorporated the ree drilling program results into an updated mineral resource and announced an upgraded and increased ni compliant mineral resource estimate on june  completed the drilling program on the bear lodge ree project in november the drilling included drill holes and an additional large diameter core holes 
the large diameter core holes provided a bulk sample for pilot plant testing 
advanced a preliminary ree metallurgical recovery process in july  with percent estimated recoveries of rare earth elements from the bear lodge ree project with a goal to produce a percent rare earth oxide reo concentrate 
completed a preliminary economic assessment  in compliance with the ni  which shows positive economics using year trailing average prices for rare earth concentrates 
collected an ton sample of ree mineralized material with the large diameter core holes and additional bulk sample material excavated to be used in a pilot plant test in completed a hole gold focused drilling program in november on the sundance gold project focusing on three main gold targets 
the targets provided the highest gold grades found to date 
filing of the company s first ni compliant inferred mineral resource estimate reported  ounces of gold in these three deposits contained in million metric tonnes averaging g au t using a g t cutoff grade 
discovery of heavy rare earths enriched mineralization at whitetail ridge  east taylor and carbon and higher grade at east taylor within the bear lodge ree project 
successfully listed the company s common shares for trading on the nyse amex headquartered in new york  ny  as well as graduating the trading of our common shares in canada from tier one of the tsx venture exchange to the tsx main trading board

cautionary note to us investors please read carefully the section titled cautionary note to us investors regarding resource and reserve estimates above 
plan of operations source of funds for fiscal year ending june  the company s primary source of funds since incorporation has been through the issuance of common shares 
as at june   the company had cash of  during the period ended september   a total of  options were exercised  resulting in an increase in cash by cdn  the company had working capital of  at june  as of september  the company had  outstanding warrants with an exercise price of cdn  which if exercised  would raise an additional cdn   outstanding stock options with exercise prices ranging from cdn to cdn  which if exercised  would raise an additional cdn  and  outstanding broker s warrants with an exercise price of cdn  which if exercised  would raise an additional cdn  there is no guarantee that the warrants  the stock options or the broker s warrants will be exercised 
management believes that with the cash the company currently has on hand and with the potential exercise of the stock options  warrants and broker s warrants  the company will be able to fund its expenditures through the end of fiscal year use of funds for fiscal year ending june  the company s current capital expenditures are for the exploration acquisition and evaluation expenses in its rare earth and gold properties 
for fiscal  the company estimates that it might expend million on general administrative expenses and million on prefeasibility study and property acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company estimates that it might expend million on rare earth acquisition exploration expenses and million on gold acquisition exploration expenses 
anticipated changes to facilities employees the company has established an office in denver  colorado  usa and hired a full time chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
the company will continue to add key personnel to develop the corporate infrastructure to support the current project development and future production operation 
trends rare earth market prices of rare earth elements are affected by the supply and demand fundamentals of the market 
recent years has seen raising prices due to increased demand and a reduction in supply 
raising demand has come from various new uses of rare earth metals in batteries  magnets and other high tech uses 
the chinese control most of the world s production of rare earth metals and the chinese have reduced exports to the rest of the world 
we expect the demand of rare earth elements to continue to increase 
we also expect supply to also increase due to several large mines outside china that are expected to be in production soon 
we cannot anticipate with any certainty what the chinese may due in the future as to rare earth metal exports 
our ability to raise additional funds in order to complete our plan of operations at our bear lodge property may be impacted by future prices for metals 
as a natural resource exploration and development company  the marketability of our common shares and our ability to raise other sources of financing has been dependent on the prices of rare earth elements and gold 
if the global demand for rare earth and gold decrease  it could adversely impair the company s ability to raise financing and fund the exploration and future development of its mineral properties 
factors that could influence upward demand for rare earth products include the use of neodymium  praseodymium  terbium and dysprosium in high strength ndfeb magnets that are critical to hybrid and electric vehicles and the increased construction of wind power generation facilities  particularly off shore installations  the use of lanthanum and cerium for nimh batteries that are utilized in hybrid and electric vehicles  the use of europium  terbium and yttrium in the production of compact fluorescent light bulbs  the use of high strength ndfeb magnets in the miniaturization of electronic products  the use of lanthanum in fluid cracking catalysts by refineries processing lower quality crude oil that consumes greater quantities of the catalysts  the increased use of rees in the drive to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas  or ghgs  by the united states and the european union  the use of cerium in glass  ceramics  glass polishing  and advanced water filtration applications  and continued research and commercialization of new applications for rare earths products the company s acquisition exploration evaluation activities vary from period to period depending upon property acquisition opportunities and exploration results 
accordingly  amounts expended in past periods may not be indicative of future activities 
likewise  amounts of external capital raised to finance such activities may vary from period to period 
segment information segmented information is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained under the section heading item financial statements and supplementary data below of this annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
sources and availability of raw materials the company is currently in the predevelopment stage and as such does not require any significant raw materials in order to carry out its primary operating objectives 
the company s primary operating objective is to gather geological and processing information in order to complete a prefeasibility study on the bear lodge project 
for at least the next year  the company is expected to continue to require the use of contract drilling services in order to obtain additional geological information 
in the past year the company has been able to secure contract drilling services without excess delay and excessive costs 
we except the contract drilling services will continue to be available over the next year 
the raw materials that the company s current operations rely are gasoline and diesel fuel for the exploration vehicles and for the heavy equipment required to build roads and conduct drilling operations 
in addition water is purchased from local municipalities to assist with the drilling activities  and a variety of drilling muds and additives are needed to ensure drill sample recovery 
seasonality seasonality in the state of wyoming is not a material factor to the company s operations for its project 
snow fall in the winter limits access to the company s bear lodge property  but it is not a material issue for the company 
competition our industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition  exploration and development of mineral properties 
there is competition for the limited number of mineral property acquisition opportunities  some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources  staff and facilities than we do 
as a result  we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties  staking claims related to our properties  and exploring and developing our properties 
china accounts for the vast majority of rare earth element production 
while rare earth element projects exist outside of china  very few are in actual production 
further  given the timeline for current exploration projects to come into production  if at all  it is likely that the chinese will be able to dominate the market for rare earth elements into the future 
this gives the chinese a competitive advantage in controlling the supply of rare earth elements and engaging in competitive price reductions to discourage competition 
any increase in the amount of rare earth elements exported from other nations  and increased competition  may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of potential market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
as a result of these factors  we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
environmental regulation the company exploration activities are subject to extensive and costly environmental requirements regulated in all countries in which the company operates under various federal  state  provincial and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  which generally includes air and water quality  hazardous waste management and reclamation 
environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which the company holds interests which are unknown to the company at present and which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
current and future laws  regulations and permits will impose significant costs  liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent the company s ability to continue operations or undertake new operations 
in particular  the company s bear lodge ree project and sundance gold project in wyoming are subject to federal and state environmental laws  regulations  and permits 
the federal agency involved with compliance is the united states forest service  sundance  wyoming district office 
the state agency involved is the wyoming department of environmental quality 
the company operates under permits granted by these two agencies and has established bonds to ensure environmental reclamation of areas disturbed 
in addition  the company operations and exploration activities in canada are subject to national and provincial laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
as of june   the company had reclamation bonds totaled  minerals exploration regulation mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national  state  provincial and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in the united states 
there are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant potential liabilities 
changes in these regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
mine safety and health administration regulations pursuant to section a of the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  issuers that are operators  or that have a subsidiary that is an operator  of a coal or other mine in the united states are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the sec information regarding specified health and safety violations  orders and citations  related assessments and legal actions  and mining related fatalities 
during the fiscal year ended june   our us exploration properties were not subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act 
employees at september   the company had twenty three full time employees consultants and thirty one part time employees consultants  sixteen of the full time and two of the part time employees consultants are directly engaged in exploration activities  and three full time and twenty five of the part time employees consultants are directly engaged in evaluation and development activities

item a 
risk factors and uncertainties readers should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to invest in our common shares 
our failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or results of operations  and the trading price of our common shares may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business 
estimates of mineralized material are forward looking statements inherently subject to error 
unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have a significant impact on mineralized material estimates and actual results may differ from estimates 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and will require additional financing to fund exploration and  if warranted  development and production 
failure to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operation and could cast uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern 
for the fiscal year ended june   our net loss was 
our accumulated deficit at june  was 
at june   our cash position was  and our working capital position was  we have not commenced commercial production on any of our mineral properties 
we have no revenues from operations and anticipate we will have no operating revenues until we place one or more of our properties into production 
all of our properties are in the exploration stage 
our management believes that based on our current working capital position  we will be able to continue operations only through the end of fiscal without raising additional capital either through debt or equity financing 
we currently do not have sufficient funds to fully complete exploration and development work on any of our properties  which means that we will be required to raise additional capital  enter into joint venture relationships or find alternative means to finance placing one or more of our properties into commercial production  if warranted 
if we fail to raise additional funds we will curtail our activities and may risk being unable to maintain our interests in our mineral properties 
failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration and development or production on one or more of our properties and any properties we may acquire in the future or even a loss of property interests 
this includes our leases over claims covering the principal deposits on our properties  which may expire unless we expend minimum levels of expenditures over the terms of such leases 
we cannot be certain that additional capital or other types of financing will be available if needed or that  if available  the terms of such financing will be favorable or acceptable to us 
future financings may cause dilution to our shareholders 
our ability to arrange additional financing in the future will depend  in part  on the prevailing capital market conditions as well as our business performance 
the most likely source of future financing presently available to us is through the sale of our securities 
any sale of common shares will result in dilution of equity ownership to existing shareholders 
this means that if we sell common shares  more common shares will be outstanding and each existing shareholder will own a smaller percentage of the shares then outstanding 
alternatively  we may rely on debt financing and assume debt obligations that require us to make substantial interest and capital payments 
also  we may issue or grant warrants or options in the future pursuant to which additional common shares may be issued 
exercise of such warrants or options will result in dilution of equity ownership to our existing shareholders 
we have no history of producing metals from our mineral properties 
we have no history of producing metals from any of our properties 
our properties are all exploration stage properties in various stages of exploration and evaluation 
our bear lodge ree project and sundance gold project are advanced exploration stage projects with identified mineralization  and our eden lake property and nuiklavik property are each early stage exploration projects 
advancing properties from exploration into the development stage requires significant capital and time  and successful commercial production from a property  if any  will be subject to completing feasibility studies  permitting and construction of the mine  processing plants  roads  and other related works and infrastructure 
as a result  we are subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including completion of feasibility studies to verify reserves and commercial viability  including the ability to find sufficient ree or gold reserves to support a commercial mining operation  the timing and cost  which can be considerable  of further exploration  preparing feasibility studies  permitting and construction of infrastructure  mining and processing facilities  the availability and costs of drill equipment  exploration personnel  skilled labor and mining and processing equipment  if required  the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and or refining arrangements  if required  and securing a commercially viable sales outlet for our products  compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements  the availability of funds to finance exploration  development and construction activities  as warranted  potential opposition from non governmental organizations  environmental groups  local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities  potential increases in exploration  construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel  power  materials and supplies  and potential shortages of mineral processing  construction and other facilities related supplies 
the costs  timing and complexities of exploration  development and construction activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies 
it is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and  if warranted  development  construction and mine start up 
accordingly  our activities may not result in profitable mining operations and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at any of our properties 
increased costs could affect our financial condition 
we anticipate that costs at our projects that we may explore or develop  will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors  such as changing ore grade  metallurgy and revisions to mine plans  if any  in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body 
in addition  costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel  rubber  and electricity 
such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements  including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable 
a material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and  if warranted  development operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production 
mining and resource exploration is inherently dangerous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans 
mining and mineral exploration involves various types of risks and hazards  including environmental hazards  power outages  metallurgical and other processing problems  unusual or unexpected geological formations  personal injury  flooding  fire  explosions  cave ins  landslides and rock bursts  inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery  equipment  or labor  metals losses  fluctuations in exploration  development and production costs  labor disputes  unanticipated variations in grade  mechanical equipment failure  and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
these risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties  production facilities or other properties  personal injury  environmental damage  delays in mining  increased production costs  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance against certain environmental risks  including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from production  may be prohibitively expensive 
we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by our insurance policies 
we operate in the resource industry  which is highly speculative  and has certain inherent exploration risks which could have a negative effect on our operations 
our long term success depends on our ability to identify mineral deposits on our existing properties and other properties we may acquire  if any  that we can then develop into commercially viable mining operations 
resource exploration is a highly speculative business  characterized by a number of significant risks including  among other things  unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits which  though present  are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production 
substantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable reserves through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal  and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
the marketability of minerals acquired or discovered by us may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond our control and which cannot be accurately predicted  such as market fluctuations  the proximity and capacity of milling facilities  mineral markets and processing equipment  and such other factors such as government regulations  including regulations relating to royalties  allowable production  importing and exporting of minerals  and environment protection 
any one or a combination of these factors may result in us not receiving an adequate return on our investment capital 
the decision to abandon a project may have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities and our ability to raise future financing we have no known reserves and no economic reserves may exist on our properties  which could have a negative effect on our operations and valuation 
despite exploration work on our mineral claims  no known bodies of commercial ore or economic deposits have been established on any of our mineral properties 
in addition  we are at the exploration stage on all of our properties and substantial additional work will be required in order to determine if any economic deposits exist on its properties 
we may expend substantial funds in exploring its properties only to abandon them and lose its entire expenditure on the properties if no commercial or economic quantities of minerals are found 
even if commercial quantities of minerals are discovered  the exploration properties might not be brought into a state of commercial production 
finding mineral deposits is dependent on a number of factors  including the technical skill of exploration personnel involved 
the commercial viability of a mineral deposit once discovered is also dependent on a number of factors  some of which are the particular attributes of the deposit  such as content of the deposit including harmful substances  size  grade and proximity to infrastructure  as well as element prices and the availability of power and water in sufficient supply to permit development 
most of these factors are beyond the control of the entity conducting such mineral exploration 
we are an exploration stage company with no history of pre tax profit and no income from its operations 
there can be no assurance that our operations will be profitable in the future 
there is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by us in the exploration of our properties will result in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities 
most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of mineral reserves will in fact be realized or that any identified mineral deposit will ever qualify as a commercially mineable or viable mineral deposit which can be legally and economically exploited 
there can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale tests will be duplicated in large scale tests under on site conditions or in production 
if we are unsuccessful in our exploration efforts  we may be forced to acquire additional projects or cease operations which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities and our ability to raise future financing 
the figures for our resources are estimates based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated 
unless otherwise indicated  mineralization figures presented in this annual report and in our filings with securities regulatory authorities  press releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time are based upon estimates made by independent geologists and our internal geologists 
when making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development  we must rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineral reserves and grades of mineralization on our properties 
until ore is actually mined and processed  mineral reserves and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only 
estimates can be imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unreliable 
we cannot assure you that these estimates will be accurate  resource or other mineralization estimates will be accurate  or this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably 
any material changes in mineral resource estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and a property return on capital 
because we have not completed feasibility studies on any of our properties and have not commenced actual production  mineralization estimates  including resource estimates  for our properties may require adjustments or downward revisions 
in addition  the grade of ore ultimately mined  if any  may differ from that indicated by our feasibility studies and drill results 
minerals recovered in small scale tests may not be duplicated in large scale tests under on site conditions or in production scale 
the resource estimates contained in this annual report have been determined and valued based on assumed future prices  cut off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate 
extended declines in market prices for gold  silver or other commodities may render portions of our mineralization and resource estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability determinations we reach 
any material reductions in estimates of mineralization  or of our ability to extract this mineralization  could have a material adverse effect on our share price and the value of our properties 
there are differences in us and canadian practices for reporting reserves and resources 
our reserve and resource estimates are not directly comparable to those made in filings subject to sec reporting and disclosure requirements  as we generally report reserves and resources in accordance with canadian practices 
these practices are different from the practices used to report reserve and resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the sec 
it is canadian practice to report measured  indicated and inferred resources  which are generally not permitted in disclosure filed with the sec by united states issuers 
in the united states  mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made 
united states investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves 
further  inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically 
disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations  however  the sec only permits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures 
accordingly  information concerning descriptions of mineralization  reserves and resources contained in this report  or in the documents incorporated herein by reference  may not be comparable to information made public by other united states companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec 
see cautionary note to us investors regarding resource and reserve estimates above 
our operations contain significant uninsured risks which could negatively impact future profitability as we maintain no insurance against our operations 
our exploration of our mineral properties contains certain risks  including unexpected or unusual operating conditions including rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  fire and earthquakes 
it is not always possible to insure against these risks 
should events such as these arise  they could reduce or eliminate our assets and shareholder equity as well as result in increased costs and a decline in the value of our securities 
we expect to maintain only general liability and director and officer insurance but no insurance against our properties or operations 
we may decide to take out this insurance in the future if it is available at economically viable rates 
mineral operations are subject to market forces outside of our control which could negatively impact our operations 
the marketability of minerals is affected by numerous factors beyond our control including market fluctuations  government regulations relating to prices  taxes  royalties  allowable production  imports  exports and supply and demand 
one or more of these risk elements could have an impact on the costs of our operations and if significant enough  reduce the profitability of our operations 
permitting  licensing and approval processes are required for our operations and obtaining and maintaining these permits and licenses is subject to conditions which we may be unable to achieve 
many of our operations require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities 
we believe we hold or are in the process of obtaining all necessary licenses and permits to carry on the activities which we are currently conducting or propose to conduct under applicable laws and regulations 
such licenses and permits are subject to changes in regulations and changes in various operating circumstances 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to maintain our exploration and mining activities including constructing mines or milling facilities and commencing operations of any of our exploration properties 
in addition  if we proceed to production on any exploration property  we must obtain and comply with permits and licenses which may contain specific operating conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such permits and licenses or that we will be able to comply with any such conditions 
costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration and development activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions  including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed  and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures  installation of additional equipment  or remedial actions 
parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations 
amendments to current laws  regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies  or more stringent implementation thereof  could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties 
we are subject to significant governmental regulations  which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business 
our current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition  prospecting  development  mining and production  laws and regulations related to exports  taxes and fees  labor standards and regulations related to occupational health and mine safety  environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal  toxic substances  land use and environmental protection  and other matters 
companies engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits may result in enforcement actions  including the forfeiture of claims  orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities requiring operations to cease or be curtailed  and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures  installation of additional equipment or costly remedial actions 
we may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of our mineral exploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws  regulations and permits 
existing and possible future laws  regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies  or more stringent implementation  could have a material adverse impact on our business and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration 
our operations are subject to environmental risks and compliance with environmental regulations which are increasing and costly 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
these laws address emissions into the air  discharges into water  management of waste  management of hazardous substances  protection of natural resources  antiquities and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations and future changes in these laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays and may cause material changes or delays in our operations and future activities 
it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant adverse impact on our properties or some portion of our business  causing us to re evaluate those activities at that time 
us federal laws the comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and comparable state statutes  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
it is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions  demands for reimbursement for government incurred cleanup costs  or natural resource damages  or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance  as well as requirements for corrective actions 
cercla  rcra and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration  mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed 
the clean air act  as amended  restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including mining and processing activities 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment  storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment  which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the clean air act and state air quality laws 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
in addition  permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions  including issuance of permits to mining facilities  and assessing alternatives to those actions 
if a proposed action could significantly affect the environment  the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an environmental impact statement eis 
the us environmental protection agency  other federal agencies  and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the eis and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final eis 
this process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts  which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project 
the clean water act cwa  and comparable state statutes  impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the environmental protection agency epa or an analogous state agency 
the cwa regulates storm water mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities 
such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run off from its operations 
the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
the cwa and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
the safe drinking water act sdwa and the underground injection control uic program promulgated thereunder  regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells 
epa directly administers the uic program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state 
the program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well 
violation of these regulations and or contamination of groundwater by mining related activities may result in fines  penalties  and remediation costs  among other sanctions and liabilities under the swda and state laws 
in addition  third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies  property damages  and bodily injury 
legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of if enacted  such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be  the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of unpatented mining claims and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance 
regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change 
legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us  our venture partners and our suppliers  including costs related to increased energy requirements  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations 
any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 
given the emotion  political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with  we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition  operating performance and ability to compete 
furthermore  even without such regulation  increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain  and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate 
these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities  water shortages  changing sea levels and changing temperatures 
these impacts may adversely impact the cost  production and financial performance of our operations 
land reclamation requirements for our properties may be burdensome and expensive 
although variable depending on location and the governing authority  land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies as well as companies with mining operations in order to minimize long term effects of land disturbance 
reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents  treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards  and reasonably re establish pre disturbance land forms and vegetation 
in order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our potential development activities  we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs 
we plan to set up a provision for our reclamation obligations on our properties  as appropriate  but this provision may not be adequate 
if we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work  our financial position could be adversely affected 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future 
the mining industry is intensely competitive 
significant competition exists for the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing  ree  gold or other metals 
we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional mining properties because we must compete with other individuals and companies  many of which have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities than us 
we may also encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to hire experienced mining professionals 
competition for exploration resources at all levels is currently very intense  particularly affecting the availability of manpower  drill rigs  mining equipment and production equipment 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future 
we compete with larger  better capitalized competitors in the mining industry 
the mining industry is competitive in all of its phases  including financing  technical resources  personnel and property acquisition 
we will require significant capital  technical resources  personnel and operational experience to effectively compete in the mining industry 
because of the high costs associated with exploration  the expertise required to analyze a project potential and the capital required to develop a mine  larger companies with significant resources may have a competitive advantage over us 
we face strong competition from other mining companies  some with greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities than us 
as a result of this competition  we may be unable to maintain or acquire financing  personnel  technical resources or attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
joint ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks 
historically  we have entered into joint venture arrangements to help fund the exploration and potential development of our properties 
in the future  we may enter into joint ventures or other partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration  development and production of certain of the properties in which we have an interest 
joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital  merger  division  dissolution  amendments of constating documents  and the pledge of joint venture assets  which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership 
further  we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties 
any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties  or any disputes with respect to the parties respective rights and obligations  could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial performance  cash flows and the price of the common shares 
foreign currency fluctuations may have a negative impact on our financial position and results 
our property interests in the united states make us subject to foreign currency fluctuations that may adversely affect our financial position and results 
as we maintain our accounts in canadian dollars  any appreciation in the us dollar against the canadian dollar will increase our costs of carrying out operations in the united states 
management has not entered into any foreign currency contracts to mitigate this risk  as such  we may suffer losses due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the absence of any of these individuals could adversely affect us 
our success is currently largely dependent on the performance  retention and abilities of our directors  officers  employees and management 
the loss of the services of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
there is no assurance that we can maintain the services of our directors  officers  employees or other qualified personnel required to operate its business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse affect on us and our prospects 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 
we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth  and the failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
competition for additional qualified management is intense  and we may be unable to attract and retain additional key personnel  or to attract and retain personnel on terms acceptable to us 
management personnel are currently limited and they may be unable to manage our expansion successfully and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not entered into non competition agreements 
as our business is substantially dependent upon the directors  executive officers and consultants  the lack of non competition agreements poses a significant risk to us in the event such persons were to resign or be terminated from such positions 
under such circumstances  such persons may provide confidential information and key contacts to our competitors and we may have difficulties in preventing the disclosure of such information 
such disclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our directors senior management are engaged in other businesses 
potential conflicts of interest and other obligations of management could interfere with corporate operations 
most of our directors and officers are engaged and will continue to be engaged in the search for additional business opportunities on behalf of other entities  and situations may arise where these directors and officers will be in direct competition with us 
conflicts  if any  will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of applicable regulations and legislation 
some of our directors and officers are or may become directors or officers of other entities engaged in other business ventures 
in order to avoid the possible conflict of interest which may arise between the directors and officers duties to us and their duties to the other entities they are involved  our directors and officers have been advised as follows by us participation in other business ventures offered to the directors or officers should be allocated between the various entities and on the basis of prudent business judgment and the relative financial abilities and needs of such entities to participate  no commissions or other extraordinary consideration will be paid to such directors and officers  and business opportunities formulated by or through other entities in which the directors and officers are involved should not be offered to us except on the same or better terms than the basis on which they are offered to third party participants 
our directors and officers are  or may become  involved in other business activities 
as a result of their other business endeavors  our directors and officers may not be able to devote sufficient time to our business affairs  which may negatively affect its ability to conduct ongoing operations and to generate revenues 
in addition  our management of may be periodically interrupted or delayed as a result of its officers other business interests 
title to our properties may be subject to other claims  which could affect our property rights and claims 
there are risks that title to our properties may be challenged or impugned 
our material property is located in wyoming and may be subject to prior unrecorded agreements or transfers or native land claims and title may be affected by undetected defects 
there may be valid challenges to the title of our properties which  if successful  could impair development and or operations 
this is particularly the case in respect of those portions of our properties in which we hold our interest solely through a lease with the claim holders  as such interest is substantially based on contract and has been subject to a number of assignments as opposed to a direct interest in the property 
several of the mineral rights to our properties consist of unpatented mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the us general mining law 
unpatented mining claims are unique property interests  and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain 
this uncertainty arises  in part  out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under the us general mining law 
also  unpatented mining claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or validity contests by the federal government 
the validity of an unpatented mining or mill site claim  in terms of both its location and its maintenance  is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of us federal and state statutory and decisional law 
in addition  there are few public records that definitively determine the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims 
should the federal government impose a royalty or additional tax burdens on the properties that lie within public lands  the resulting mining operations could be seriously impacted  depending upon the type and amount of the burden us investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against us or our directors  controlling persons and officers 
it may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against us 
we are incorporated in the province of british columbia under the british columbia business corporations act 
many of our directors are residents of canada  and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside of the united states  predominately in canada 
as a result  it may be difficult for us holders of our common shares to effect service of process on these persons within the united states or to realize in the united states upon judgments rendered against them 
in addition  a shareholder should not assume that the courts of canada i would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or other laws of the united states  or ii would enforce  in original actions  liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the us federal securities laws or other laws of the united states 
risk related to our securities we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends 
we have not declared any dividends since incorporation and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
our present policy is to retain all available funds for use in our operations and the expansion of our business 
payment of future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  contractual restrictions  capital requirements  business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant 
accordingly  investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of our securities appreciates 
dilution through outstanding common share options could adversely affect our shareholders 
because our success is highly dependent upon our employees and consultants  we have granted to some or all of our key employees  directors and consultants options to purchase common shares as non cash incentives 
to the extent that significant numbers of such options may be granted and exercised  the interests of the other shareholders may be diluted 
as of the date of this form k  there are  share purchase options outstanding  which  if exercised  would result in an additional  common shares being issued and outstanding 
price volatility of our publicly traded securities could adversely affect investor s portfolios 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states and canada have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market prices of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
there can be no assurance that continual fluctuations in price will not occur 
it may be anticipated that any quoted market for the common shares will be subject to market trends and conditions generally  notwithstanding any potential success of the company in creating revenues  cash flows or earnings 
the price of our common shares have been subject to price and volume volatility in the past and will likely continue to be subject to such volatility in the future 
we likely constituted a passive foreign investment company during the tax year ended june   which will likely have adverse us federal income tax consequences for us shareholders 
us investors in our common shares should be aware that we believe that we were classified as a pfic during the tax year ended june   and based on current business plans and financial expectations  we expect that we will be a pfic for the current tax year 
if we are a pfic for any year during a us shareholder s holding period  then such us shareholder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of common shares  or any so called excess distribution received on its common shares  as ordinary income  and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distributions  unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective qualified electing fund election qef election or a mark to market election with respect to the common shares 
a us shareholder who makes a qef election generally must report on a current basis its share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a pfic  whether or not we distribute any amounts to our shareholders 
however  us shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurance that we will satisfy record keeping requirements that apply to a qualified electing fund  or that we will supply us shareholders with information that such us shareholders require to report under the qef election rules  in the event that we are a pfic and a us shareholder wishes to make a qef election 
thus  us shareholders may not be able to make a qef election with respect to their common shares 
a us shareholder who makes the mark to market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the common shares over the taxpayer s basis therein 
each us shareholder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the us federal  us federal alternative minimum  us federal estate and gift  us state and local  and foreign tax consequences of the pfic rules and the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares

a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings holds a percent mineral rights interest in a group of unpatented mineral claims  known as the bear lodge property  which consists of the bear lodge ree project and the sundance gold project 
the property is situated in the bear lodge mountains of crook county  northeastern wyoming 
these claims were  in part  acquired from freeport mcmoran copper gold freeport  which was known as phelp dodge corporation at that time  by way of a mineral lease and option for deed 
some of the claims and a portion of a defined area of influence surrounding the claims were previously subject to a production royalty of percent of net smelter returns nsr payable to freeport 
rer  inc owns a portion of the claim group outright and those claims were not subject to the nsr 
on march   the company re purchased the nsr for  the core group of claims is free of royalties

these fees are paid up to date 
the bear lodge ree project contains high grades of predominantly the light ree lanthanum  cerium  praseodymium  neodymium  and samarium and some of the highest grades in north america of the heavy ree europium and terbium plus significant quantities of the heavy ree dysprosium 
accessibility  climate  local resources  infrastructure and physiography the bear lodge property is located in central crook county  northeastern wyoming  in the northwestern portion of the black hills uplift 
the property is situated immediately north of the crest of the bear lodge mountains  a relatively small northwesterly trending range 
the property is flanked to the west by the powder river basin  famous for its extensive coalmines  and is surrounded by the great plains 
the bear lodge property lies about road miles northwest of the small town of sundance  wyoming  approximately air miles west of the south dakota state line  air miles east of the larger town of gillette  wyoming  and miles north of cheyenne  the state capitol 
gillette has many of the services required by the mining industry 
access to the bear lodge property is very good  but in the winter months the property is not as readily accessible due to snow accumulation 
primary access to the property is from the town of sundance  wyoming  situated along us interstate highway the project area is reached by traveling on paved roads west from sundance about miles along us highway  then north on us forest service taylor divide road for miles to the summit of warren peaks 
the final miles to the bull hill area of the property is on well maintained gravel roads continuing on usfs and then right on usfs until the turnoff to the bull hill road  about miles of a narrow one lane dirt road leading to the bull hill ree target area 
road access within the property is relatively extensive via a number of good quality logging roads and four wheel drive trails that were cleared during previous exploration and logging activities 
motels  restaurants  and gas stations are available to the south in the nearby town of sundance  and a greater variety of accommodations and services are available to the east in spearfish  south dakota 
necessary infrastructure  such as housing  food  fuel  etc  would be available in either town  or further to the west in gillette  wyoming  should the property enter the development stage 
water rights would likely be available through purchase  and a major power line runs within a mile of the property 
supplies can be trucked to the site miles from gillette  which is located on both us interstate highway and rail lines 
a burlington northern rail transport line also runs through moorcroft  miles west of sundance 
the gillette area has a coal fired power plant  and the city would be a major logistics center for any development at the bear lodge property 
the current size of the property is sufficiently large to support a mining operation  with no foreseeable obstacles regarding expansion  subject to a favorable environmental permitting outcome 
the bear lodge mountains have a warm and relatively dry climate during summer  followed by cold winters with variable amounts of snow 
optimal field conditions extend from april to november 
the taylor divide road is not maintained during winter months  and snowmobile access is given priority from december through march 
the property lies within the black hills national forest along the crest of the northern part of the bear lodge mountains  a narrow northwest trending range situated in northeastern wyoming 
physiographically it is a northwesterly extension of the black hills of western south dakota 
the range is characterized by rounded grass and pine covered mountains reaching elevations of  feet within the property 
the mountains have moderate slopes covered by western yellow pine forest interspersed with dense thickets of brush 
narrow grassy meadows cover the upper reaches of seasonal drainages 
the lowest point within the property is about  feet elevation 
bear lodge ree project mineral resources the company s comprehensive ni compliant technical report with an initial mineral resource estimate of ree plus yttrium at the bull hill deposit was dated april  the report incorporated descriptions of all the exploration work and metallurgical testing completed by the company since the initial exploration ni compliant report was issued in the report also included recommendations for additional exploration work to expand the ree mineral resource and the metallurgical testing program 
the recommended work was completed 
on may   the company reported an updated mineral resource estimate of ree plus yttrium contained in two deposits located in the bull hill area of the bear lodge ree project 
the updated mineral resource estimate increased the total pounds of rare earth oxides reos contained in the bull hill deposits by more than percent from million pounds to  million pounds at a percent reo cutoff grade 
the mineral resource was estimated by an independent consultant ore reserves engineering ore 
on june   the company announced the results of an upgraded and increased ni compliant mineral resource estimate of ree plus yttrium contained in three deposits located in the bull hill area of the bear lodge ree project table 
the updated resource estimate upgrades million tons mm metric tonnes to the indicated category and increases the total pounds of reo contained in the bull hill high grade deposits by percent from  million pounds million kg to  million pounds million kg at a percent reo cutoff grade tables and 
the mineral resources were estimated by ore  an independent consultant 
the new resource estimate is derived from a ree database that includes eighty six core drill holes completed by the company between and for a total of  feet  m 
the new resource estimate focuses on the dike sets in the bull hill bull hill southwest deposit  plus the bull hill northwest and the whitetail ridge deposit areas 
in addition  the drilling indicates significant potential for expansion of all three deposits  for discovering mineralization in the undrilled areas between the deposits  and for definition of resources in other areas  such as bull hill west  east taylor and the carbon ree target

the current upgraded resource  plus additional resources planned for upgrade during the drill program  will be included in a preliminary feasibility study scheduled for completion in early the company s exploration program is planned to include more than in fill and step out drill holes to further upgrade and expand the resource 
geology mineralization ree mineralization occurs in the north central core of the bear lodge alkaline igneous complex located in northeastern wyoming 
all of the most important ree deposits and occurrences in the bear lodge district are controlled by rer  inc s lode claims  and are located in the vicinity of bull hill 
rare earth mineralized bodies occurring as dikes and veins within the bull hill area of the district include a well defined  near surface oxidized fmr iron oxide manganese oxide ree zone  a near surface oxidized but incompletely leached carbonatite zone oxide carbonate zone  a transitional or mixed zone oxide sulfide  and a deeper sulfide bearing carbonatite a high carbonate igneous rock zone 
the oxide carbonate and transitional zones were referred to collectively in previous new releases and technical reports as transitional zone 
as the company s understanding of the deposit has progressed  it made sense to subclassify mineralized zones based on key characteristics of those zones 
the fmr dikes and veins contain no matrix carbonates or sulfides 
the sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides  and the non ree bearing carbonate minerals calcite and strontianite are completely leached from the zone  which ranges from the surface to depths of about feet 
the oxide carbonate zone generally occurs beneath the oxide zone  but may locally breach the surface in select dikes 
it is characterized by an absence of sulfides  with the residual iron oxides formed during the complete oxidation of the former sulfide minerals  and by variable amounts of relict matrix carbonates calcite strontianite 
as now defined  the transitional zone is relatively flat lying and occurs as a thin layer immediately above the sulfide bearing carbonatite zone 
it contains mixed iron oxides and sulfides  along with a significant amount of relict matrix carbonates 
the iron oxides in this zone are derived primarily from the variable partial to complete oxidation of constituent sulfide minerals 
the unoxidized sulfide bearing carbonatite at depth has not been leached of matrix carbonates and retains all of its initial sulfide content 
metallurgy of the oxide zone is well established and has been reported previously 
initial metallurgical testing of the oxide carbonate zone resource indicates that mineral pre concentration test results are similar to those for the oxide zone mineralization 
early indications suggest that chemical concentration of the reo from this zone will consume more reagents than the oxide zone mineralization 
the bull hill deposit  formerly known as bull hill sw  contains the bulk of the current resources 
the deposit comprises a steeply dipping fmr carbonatite dike swarm 
geological interpretation of results from the drill program indicate that the bull hill resource area is dominated by northwest striking mineralized bodies in the southern two thirds of the resource area  while the northern part of the resource area exhibits a transitional change in strike from dominantly northwesterly to almost due north 
the dike swarm primarily intrudes heterolithic intrusive breccia of the bull hill diatreme 
carbonatite dikes at depth are interpreted to transition toward the surface into either oxide carbonate bodies or fmr bodies  which range in size from veinlets to large dikes more than feet in width 
the bull hill deposit consists of one dominant dike set and several subsidiary dike sets in a swarm that strikes over  feet in length and covers several hundred feet in width 
the dikes appear to pinch and swell in both strike and dip directions  and they can be traced in drill holes more than  feet down dip 
a number of gold deposits and other occurrences of anomalous gold are distributed peripherally to the bull hill ree mineralization and are part of the company s sundance gold project 
the bull hill northwest deposit shares many characteristics with the bull hill deposit 
the oxide zone extends somewhat deeper  probably owing to a complex regime of intersecting fault structures 
the structural controls for the mineralized bodies remain incompletely understood in this resource area  but it appears most likely that northerly striking mineralized bodies predominate 
the dikes cut alkalic silicate rocks  predominantly trachytes and phonolites  and they are part of an fmr carbonatite dike system that appears to be distinct from the bull hill sw dike system 
the deposit is open to the north and at depth 
additional drilling will be done during the program to better define the orientation of the system and to expand the current resource 
the whitetail ridge deposit is marked at the surface by a zone of fmr stockwork and a coincident geophysical anomaly 
the size of the geophysical anomaly approximately  by  feet elongate northeasterly provides an indication that the ree target may be larger than others in the district 
detailed mapping suggests that the ree mineralization consists of northwest striking fmr dikes and an fmr stockwork zone that is elongate northeasterly  with dimensions of roughly  feet meters by feet meters 
the enveloping geophysical anomaly is larger and may indicate a broader distribution of ree mineralization beneath the extensive soil and colluvial cover 
this is the same area that the us bureau of mines drilled in the early s and estimated a large tonnage of low grade stockwork mineralization 
only a small part of this target area has been tested with the company s drill holes 
drilling during the company s planned program is expected to expand and better delineate the current whitetail ridge resource 
the major dike sets in all of the resource areas are accompanied by peripheral zones of lower grade stockwork ree mineralization 
the term stockwork refers to a rock cut by a network of small veins or dikes that contain the mineralization 
ree grades in the stockwork zones range between about and percent reo 
the company is investigating low cost physical processing methods to upgrade the contained ree mineralization in the stockwork for eventual inclusion with the resources reported here 
the company considers the geologic modeling and resource estimation results encouraging for the following reasons a portion of the oxidized resource was upgraded to the indicated category 
the tonnage of the overall resource was expanded relative to the may  ni compliant resource estimate  but with slightly lower reo grades 
the more extensively drilled bull hill deposit shows excellent lateral and vertical continuity of mineralization and grades within the dike sets 
the ree mineralization that constitutes the bull hill resource is open for expansion at depth  to the southeast  and to the northwest toward whitetail ridge 
the whitetail ridge deposit was defined by drilling in only a small part of the target area 
the bull hill west target area hosts fmr carbonatite dikes that may be related to both the bull hill and whitetail ridge mineralizing systems and mineralization appears to be open in all directions 
the company believes that there is room for the mineral resource tonnage to increase significantly in all deposit and target areas 
bulk tonnage  lower grade stockwork mineralization adjacent to the higher grade zones is extensive  and only a small part of the potential has been tested by drill holes 
with further metallurgical testing  this material may be defined as an additional resource 
the updated mineral resource estimate confirms that potentially economic resources are present in the bull hill area  and it justifies further technical work including drilling  metallurgical testing  and engineering studies 
considerable in fill definition drilling is required to increase the confidence level and upgrade more of the inferred resources to the indicated category 
step out drilling is planned to expand the resource and define the boundaries of the mineralization 
cutoff grade metallurgy the resource size is sensitive to an assumed cut off grade  which is sensitive to metallurgical operating costs 
the company is advancing its rare earth metallurgical studies at mountain states research development international  vail  arizona  nagrom  perth  australia  and hazen research  golden  colorado 
the objective for each of these testing laboratories is developing and optimizing an effective and cost efficient metallurgical flowsheet 
the metallurgical testing program will continue through on mineralized core samples collected during the test program includes a pilot plant test being conducted at hazen research using approximately tons of material collected in near the surface with large diameter core drilling and from surface samples collected during drill site excavations

they share the opinion that the data are of good quality and suitable for use in the resource estimate 
metallurgy the metallurgical testing is ongoing on oxide samples 
nearly all of this material is sufficiently close to the surface for potential mining by open pit methods 
the current oxide mineral resource contains million tons of indicated resource at a grade of reo and million tons of inferred resource at a grade of reo  using a reo cutoff grade table above 
the oxide mineralization extends from surface to depths of to feet 
excellent exploration potential for expansion of the oxide mineralization was tested in by a program of step out drilling  and in fill drilling was directed at an upgrade of the mineral resource category 
the current testing program conducted on this oxide mineralization is designed to take advantage of the unique type of mineral occurrence of the ree mineralization 
the mineralization is characterized by fine grained ree minerals that variably adhere to the surfaces of the coarser gangue non ree bearing minerals 
the ree minerals in oxide mineralization from the mineral resource area are largely from the bastnasite group bastnasite  synchysite  and parasite with variable proportions of monazite 
metallurgical testwork is being conducted at mountain states r d international  inc msrdi of vail  arizona 
preliminary testing of ree separation was conducted at intellimet llc of missoula  montana 
confirmatory testing is being conducted by nagrom of perth  australia with additional separation testwork planned to be conducted by ansto australian nuclear science and technology organization of sydney  australia 
bulk sampling of oxide mineralization from large diameter drill core and from surface trenches took place in the fall of the bulk sample is being processed in a pilot plant test currently in as part of a planned pre feasibility study 
rare earth mineralized bodies occur as high grade dikes and veins within the bull hill deposit 
they include a well defined  near surface oxidized zone that has been the subject of most metallurgical testing to date 
the oxide mineralization contains essentially no matrix carbonates or sulfides 
the sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides  and the non ree bearing carbonate minerals calcite and strontianite are completely leached from the zone  which ranges from the surface to depths of about feet 
these conditions created a loose and friable oxide material that allows for a simple physical mineral processing method 
in parts of the high grade zone  the sulfides are oxidized but matrix carbonate is partially and variably leached 
this zone is termed the oxide carbonate zone 
a thin transitional zone occurs at the base of the oxide and or oxide carbonate zone at a depth of approximately feet m 
the transitional zone passes relatively abruptly into the sulfide bearing zone with typical carbonatite characteristics 
tests on the high grade oxide mineralization indicate that recoveries of to percent of reo are expected using a two stage process 
the first stage is mineral concentration  also known as physical upgrading pug 
the second stage is a chemical leaching process using hydrochloric acid that produces a mixed rare earths leachate that is precipitated as a bulk carbonate concentrate 
the series of bench scale testing programs was completed by msrdi under the direction of dr 
roshan bhappu 
the test results show that percent reo can be recovered in weight percent of the original mass weight by employing a simple washing  scrubbing  and screening process that produces a mineral pre concentrate of sand size and finer particles 
the washing and screening process uses only water as a process media and is similar to gravel washing plants that are commonly employed throughout the united states 
using an percent reo head grade sample  the pre concentrate can be upgraded to percent reo using this process 
a parallel series of tests to verify the process has been conducted by nagrom of perth  australia  under the direction of mr

the study was prepared by independent consultant  john t 
boyd company boyd  with the assistance of consultants mountain states r d international msrdi and ore 
it includes ni compliant inferred mineral resource estimates for two of the four known mineralized zones at bear lodge ree project bull hill and bull hill northwest deposits that were prepared by ore 
the study provides an initial development model and a preliminary economic analysis of the project based on the mineral resources estimated for the two deposits 
the final ni compliant technical report was filed on sedar on november  the study was commissioned by the company in to evaluate the potential economic viability of recovering rees in concentrate from the mineral resources in the bull hill area of the bear lodge ree project  with a future goal to recover individual reos 
this was in response to growing demand for these elements in environmental and other applications where the ree are vital to the new technologies developed for fuel efficient hybrid automobiles and plug in electric vehicles 
many hybrid cars use rechargeable nickel metal hydride ni m h batteries that contain lanthanum along with electric motors and generators that require high strength permanent magnets containing neodymium  praseodymium  dysprosium  and terbium 
substantial quantities of all five of these rare earth elements would be produced by a mine at bear lodge  and these five elements would represent nearly percent of potential saleable products value 
rare earths markets and pricing for an independent analysis of ree markets  including supply and demand forecasts  boyd relied on a recent confidential report and supporting data produced by imcoa  an independent industrial minerals research firm based in perth  australia and led by dudley j 
kingsnorth 
this report was requested by the company and provided to boyd as a basic reference 
the imcoa report forecasts growth in global demand for ree at a rate of nearly percent per year until  from approximately  tons in to  tons by to  tons by  expressed as treo total rare earth oxides or the sum of all ree plus yttrium 
during this period  primary supply sources located mainly in china are not expected to increase production significantly  creating a growing supply demand gap 
china has been reducing its exports of rare earths for several years and announced a major reduction in exports in early july these policies have already caused significant price increases for most ree and created opportunities for new primary suppliers to enter the market 
boyd concludes that the bear lodge ree project mineral resources  which require significant further work to bring to the feasibility level of analysis  represent an attractive potential mine development opportunity for the company 
bear lodge low cost open pit mining the development model utilized by boyd and its associates for the study contemplates conventional truck and shovel open pit mine production from the near surface oxide inferred mineral resources in the bull hill and bull hill nw deposits  which would provide an initial mine life of years 
recent drilling has successfully intersected ree outside the known mineral resources and may support an eventual increase of mine life beyond that contemplated in the study 
the current mineral resources at the bear lodge ree project are categorized as indicated and inferred mineral resources 
mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
mineral resource estimates do not account for mineability  selectivity  mining loss and dilution 
these mineral resource estimates include inferred mineral resources that are normally considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves 
there is also no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be converted to measured and indicated categories through further drilling  or into mineral reserves  once economic considerations are applied 
also  there is no certainty that this preliminary economic assessment will be realized 
an economic assessment will almost certainly change as new information is generated on the mineral resources  mine plan  and processing methodology 
bear lodge ree production in the base case scenario  a conservative production rate beginning at tons per day of mineralized material will progressively increase to  tons per day by year three 
once full production is achieved  the total reo treo produced each year would be approximately  tons  metric tons in bulk ree concentrates 
discounted cash flow analysis of this scenario  using through ree bulk mixed concentrate prices  and capital and operating costs  yields a percent internal rate of return irr and a net present value npv of us million at a percent discount rate or a us million npv at a percent discount rate on an after tax basis over a mine life of years 
the company is performing initial market studies regarding the sale of bulk ree concentrates in north america to potential refiners processors 
hydrometallurgical tests for extraction and separation of individual rare earth oxides are progressing  and the ultimate goal is the production and sale of high purity oxides of cerium  lanthanum  neodymium  praseodymium  and possibly europium  dysprosium  terbium  and other reo 
these products may be sold individually as oxides  or in various combinations such as didymium neodymium and praseodymium  seg samarium  europium and gadolinium  or as mischmetal a mix of the rare earth elements 
bear lodge rare earth prices the prices used in this study are based on historic three year average concentrate prices 
it is important to note the following reo concentrate prices are lower than refined reo prices 
historic reo concentrate prices are significantly lower than the current reo concentrate prices as quoted in metal pages 
for the bear lodge distribution of rare earths  current prices have recently increased approximately percent from the three year historic average due to the reduction in exports of ree products from china during the third quarter of  however  it is unknown if the current higher prices are sustainable 
a percent change in the price of reo concentrate would change the base case npv of the project on an after tax basis by approximately million at a percent discount rate  and million at a percent discount rate 
the sale of concentrates from bear lodge would likely be subject to a long term supply contract for which a price would be set in the contract with one or more buyers 
these long term prices can differ substantially from quoted spot prices for metals with smaller markets such as rees 
the price assumptions used by boyd for the reo concentrates are based on compilations of the past three years that range from  to  to kg 
these concentrates contain approximately percent reo and were derived from deposits that have a similar  but slightly less valuable  reo distribution compared to the bear lodge deposits 
the concentrate price is based on metal pages data through august  a recent price quote for ree concentrates on an fob china basis  as reported on september  by metal pages 
com  was kg and on february   is kg 
the elements needed for high strength permanent ree magnets include neodymium  praseodymium  dysprosium and terbium  prices were quoted by metal pages september  at   and kg  respectively for those elements  and february  at   and kg  respectively 
current ree producers seek to increase production of neodymium  praseodymium  dysprosium and terbium to meet the growing demand from magnet manufacturers 
this underlines the need for new producers with mineral resources having an ree distribution that is more reflective of current market demand  such as that indicated for the bastnasite group minerals at bear lodge 
the economic model suggested by imcoa and tested by boyd envisions a percent market share capture  metric tonnes of up to a  tonne reo market specifically for cerium  lanthanum  neodymium  praseodymium  plus significant quantities of other rare earths 
this assumes that other mines  one in the usa and one in australia  plus possibly one or two others will go into production prior to bear lodge  and that imcoa s projections of market growth will allow additional producers of the light and heavy rare earths to successfully market their products by for the purposes of the pea  the company has also shown a case that uses a percent increase from the three year trailing average prices used in the base case scenario 
the company believes these may more realistically reflect long term pricing for reo based on market outlook information available at this time 
as with the recent pricing for reo  there is no certainty these prices will be maintained for the duration of the operating life of the bear lodge ree project 
bear lodge capital costs capital cost estimates for the bear lodge ree project are lower than many other ree projects for two principal reasons infrastructure in the project vicinity is already well established with an excellent road and highway system  nearby railroads  nearby power lines  an available water source  and skilled labor within several local communities  and the metallurgical pre concentration of rare earth minerals is a very simple and low cost process that upgrades the mineralized material for further hydrometallurgical concentration 
the capital cost estimate for the base case production is projected at million in construction capital and million in sustaining capital 
this scenario involves development of the bull hill deposit at a mining rate of tons per day tpd or  tons per year tpy 
operating costs for the project are estimated at per ton of material milled  with the most significant single cost being reagent consumption in hydrometallurgical processing 
the model assumes mining by open pit methods and processing of the mineralized material on site to produce mineral pre concentrates by crushing  attritioning with water  and size separation methods 
ree recoveries of percent are assumed for the mineral pre concentration based on preliminary bench scale testwork  however these results have yet to be confirmed with pilot scale tests 
while this model further assumes construction of a hydrometallurgical plant near the mine site  the current plans are to move this plant off site to an industrial area where there is access to water and low cost power for the processing of the ree mineral concentrates in order to produce a bulk mixed ree concentrate 
metallurgical recovery to a concentrate is estimated at percent from the pre concentrate  for overall recoveries of approximately to percent into the concentrate 
all of these process stages are being tested currently for optimization and reduction of operating costs  and significant progress is being made with potential reduction of reagent costs 
further testwork is ongoing to extract and separate individual reo products to percent purity levels 
the company s ultimate goal is the production and sale of individual high purity rare earth oxides reo  which would require additional capital costs 
bear lodge reo distribution the ree mineral resources at bear lodge are of potentially significant interest to the market because of their relatively high proportions of contained neodymium  praseodymium  europium  dysprosium and terbium 
demand is increasing for these elements in the magnet production and other industries  but they typically occur in lower concentrations in the majority of known ree deposits 
bear lodge pea summary the results of the pea demonstrate that the bear lodge ree project can achieve acceptable after tax returns on invested capital and therefore warrants further investment to advance the project to a prefeasibility level of analysis 
increased rates of return are potentially achievable through any combination of higher prices  increased product sales  higher mineral resource reserve grades  lower operating costs  or higher metal recoveries 
boyd recommended that the bear lodge ree project proceed to a preliminary feasibility level analysis 
the recommended work includes completion of bulk sampling  pilot plant testing  further drilling of the bull hill and bull hill nw deposits to upgrade more of the ree mineral resources to measured or indicated categories of confidence  reo extraction and separation testwork on both the bull hill and bull hill nw deposits  environmental studies  mine permitting  and continuing community engagement 
the estimated cost of this work program is million with the work to be conducted in two phases 
phase is currently underway and comprises preparation of an updated mineral resources estimate that includes drilling results completed  continued metallurgical testing  and a pilot plant test 
phase work is being conducted on samples and analyses from the drilling program 
phase includes another drilling program initiated in june and extending through november for further mineral resource expansion  mineral resource definition  and collection of metallurgical samples that will be used in a subsequent full feasibility study 
the phase program will then proceed to more detailed metallurgical testwork and engineering studies  leading to final process design and commercial testing  market studies  environmental studies and mine permitting  community consultation  engineering design  and economic modeling 
phase work commenced in the late spring of risks opportunities the principal risks for the bear lodge ree project are identified as follows permitting and regulatory timelines and outcomes  changes in metallurgical recoveries as testwork continues  future pricing of reo  changes to capital and operating costs as studies continue 
the principal opportunities for the project are identified as follows drilling in intersected significant grades of reo outside the limits of the mineral resources used in the pea  which could result in increased mineral resources and potentially extend the mine life and or support a higher production level 
optimization work is advancing and has had some success in developing a more cost effective and efficient metallurgical processing method than that included in the scoping study for the bull hill area mineralization 
these data were not available for the scoping study 
hydrometallurgical tests for extraction and separation of individual rare earth oxides is progressing  and the ultimate goal is the production and sale of high purity oxides of neodymium  praseodymium  dysprosium  terbium  europium  lanthanum  cerium  and other reo 
drilling has encountered large areas of low grade percent reo oxide mineralization adjacent to the higher grade dikes 
these areas are not included in the mineral resource estimates and will be the subject of some drilling and metallurgical testing to determine if the material can be upgraded with a simple  inexpensive process of screening or screening and washing

recent updates on august   the company announced the discovery of high grades of heavy rare earth elements hree in the whitetail ridge resource area  and in the east taylor and carbon target areas  and the discovery of high grade ree mineralization at the east taylor target at the bear lodge ree project figure 
all three of the mineralized zones are located in the western half of an expanding ree mineralized district the bear lodge ree district 
the western areas are characterized by high grades percent reo and substantial quantities of the light rare earths lree  along with some of the highest grades of heavy rare earths in north american deposits 
they are particularly enriched in europium  terbium  dysprosium  and gadolinium eu  tb  dy  and gd 
the east taylor and carbon targets also contain significant yttrium 
the recognition of substantial grades of hree  in addition to the known high grades of lree in the western part of the bear lodge rare earth district  is a major step forward in expanding the potential size of the district 
the higher hree values and projected increased demand for select light and heavy ree could have strongly positive economic benefits to the bear lodge ree project 
these deposits may represent a significant source of the most valuable ree  which include neodymium  praseodymium  europium  terbium  and dysprosium 
rare element is considering a variety of alliances in the advancement of its bear lodge ree project 
bear lodge rare earth district zonation of light and heavy ree discoveries of high grade ree mineralization at whitetail ridge  east taylor  and carbon expand the area of known ree mineralization well outside of the bull hill deposits and identify a district underlain by significant and potentially economic ree mineralization 
the data indicate that the bear lodge ree district covers a crudely elliptical area that extends approximately feet m northwest southeast by feet m northeast southwest figure 
the whitetail ridge resource area and carbon target are located northwest of the bull hill ree deposits  and the east taylor target is located west of the bull hill deposits 
based on a re evaluation of assay data for the whitetail ridge and carbon areas during the company s most recent resource estimation news release dated june  and newly received ree assay data from the east taylor target area  assay grades for individual ree between deposits and target areas at the bear lodge project suggest a zonation of ree distribution in the district 
the mineralization at whitetail ridge  east taylor  and carbon has a distribution characterized by elevated abundances of hree relative to the mineralization at bull hill 
the three western mineralized zones are characterized by high grades and substantial quantities of the lree  as well as some of the highest grades of hree in north american deposits 
they are particularly enriched in europium  terbium  dysprosium  and gadolinium eu  tb  dy  and gd  as shown in table the hree enrichment was identified during the re examination of reverse circulation drill chips in several of the company s gold exploration holes 
the mineralized intervals in drill holes sun  sun  and sun were submitted for ree analyses earlier this year  and the assay results demonstrate the hree enrichment 
lree generally include ce  la  nd  pr  and sm  hree include eu  gd  tb  dy  ho  er  tm  yb  lu  and y 
these new discoveries indicate good potential for new deposits of high grade ree in the western half of the bear lodge ree project  and those deposits appear particularly enriched in the hree

identification of high grade hrees at the whitetail ridge deposit the identification of significant hree mineralization at the whitetail ridge resource area is the result of a detailed evaluation of assay data during the most recent resource estimation work news release dated june  
this recognition triggered a review of all the ree mineralized drill holes in the general western area 
the whitetail ridge deposit is located approximately feet m northwest of the main bull hill ree deposit figure 
the area was identified previously as an exceptional ree mineralization target news release dated october   based on factors including the intersection of ree mineralization as fmr feox mnox ree  designated as mnox veins in figure dikes and veins in five nearby historic drill holes  detailed geological mapping of fmr vein material in historic exploration trenches figure  and a broad positive ground geophysical anomaly of a type coincident with significant ree mineralization in other parts of the project area 
the size of the geophysical anomaly approximately by feet  by m  elongate northeasterly provides an indication that this ree target may be larger than others in the district 
detailed mapping suggests that the ree mineralization consists of northwest striking fmr dikes and an fmr stockwork zone that is elongate northeasterly  with dimensions of roughly feet meters by feet meters 
the enveloping geophysical anomaly is larger and may indicate a broader distribution of ree mineralization beneath the extensive soil and colluvial cover 
preliminary mineralogical studies by dr 
anthony n 
mariano indicate that monazite an ree th phosphate may represent a significant proportion of the ree mineralogy  and that the hree mineralization may reside in the monazite 
grades for europium  gadolinium  terbium  and dysprosium for the current whitetail ridge resource estimate  as reported in table  are among the highest in north american ree deposits 
during the drilling program  two core holes were completed in the whitetail ridge area from a single drill site figure 
both holes encountered significant intercepts of ree mineralization that exhibit strong enrichment in both lree and hree tables and  news release dated november  
only a small portion of the large whitetail ridge target area was tested with the holes  but the drilling gives a good indication of the total potential of the target area 
these holes  plus historic drill hole assay data from five widely spaced older holes in the general target area  surface mapping  and trench sampling assay data were all used directly or indirectly by ore to estimate an inferred mineral resource for whitetail ridge of million tons million metric tonnes averaging percent treo news release dated june  
drilling is currently underway at the whitetail ridge deposit and surrounding target area 
approximately to additional holes are planned for the target area in table reo grades and distribution in the oxidized zone of the whitetail ridge deposit element ce la nd pr sm gd y eu dy tb er yb lu ho tm assay reo distribution oxide new high grade ree discovery at east taylor and hree enrichment the east taylor target is located approximately feet m west of the main bull hill ree deposit and feet southwest of the whitetail ridge deposit figure 
the taylor target area was principally known as a gold target until the drilling program intersected a thick fmr zone in reverse circulation rc drill hole sun drill hole sun and an earlier rc hole drilled by newmont sun were collared adjacent to an outcrop of fmr veins identified by the us geological survey staatz  figure 
the zone appears to have an easterly strike  as opposed to the dominant northwesterly and northerly mineralized structures in the bull hill whitetail ridge deposits 
preliminary geological mapping and projection of fmr intercepts in drill holes suggest that the ree mineralization consists of dikes and adjacent stockwork with dimensions of roughly feet meters east west by feet meters north south  and the mineralization is open to the east 
the ree mineralization was recognized in drill chips from sun by rare element geologist  allen andersen 
the mineralized intercepts were sent subsequently for quantitative ree assays  reported here in tables and newmont hole sun also intersected strong ree mineralization in a correlative intercept table  the high grade ree zone in drill hole sun is contained within a well mineralized gold zone that averages ounces per ton grams per tonne from to feet m 
correlative fmr mineralization was recognized also in newmont drill hole sun  which was not assayed for ree 
follow up core drilling at the east taylor target was undertaken with seven drill holes 
assays are pending

in many cases values exceeded the upper limit of the method for individual ree ie upper assay limit for ce was ppm 
it should be noted that the company s proprietary internal standards submitted with the samples from drill hole sun were certified at that time for only y  la  ce  pr  nd  sm  th  and u  and not for the other ree 
the samples are now being re submitted with the newly developed standards that are certified for y  la  ce  pr  nd  sm  eu  gd  tb  dy  ho  th  and u 
rare element s rigorous qa qc program exceeds industry standards  as ree assays are routinely reported and assessed using only analytical laboratory standards for evaluation of data quality 
discovery of high grade hrees at the carbon ree target the carbon ree mineralization was identified by rare element in drill hole sun  a reverse circulation drill hole that was part of the company s gold exploration program 
the carbon ree target is located about feet m northwest of the whitetail ridge deposit along an apparent northwest trending zone of mineralization figure 
two reverse circulation drill holes sun and sun completed during the sundance gold exploration program cut significant ree mineralization in fmr vein material 
ree bearing intercepts from the carbon target area are summarized in table and were reported earlier this year in a news release dated april  if this mineralization is a continuation of the whitetail ridge dike system and the bull hill system  the total mineralization trend may reach more than feet m in length

als chemex vancouver is accredited to iso and operates according to als group standards consistent with iso methods at other laboratories 
the samples were prepared and subjected to lithium metaborate fusion  followed by icp analysis and a mass spectroscopy finish 
analytical quality is monitored through the use of randomly inserted quality control samples  including standards  blanks  and duplicates  which are blinded to the analytical laboratory 
no duplicates were submitted for the sun samples  owing to insufficient sample 
results of the analyses at als chemex are evaluated continuously by dr jeffrey jaacks  the company qa qc consultant  who is a qualified person according to national instrument the results from the current data set indicate acceptable accuracy and precision 
blank analyses also indicate no issues with carry over contamination 
rare element resources developed a set of proprietary internal ree analytical standards using bear lodge deposit mineralized material during late and early under the supervision of dr 
jaacks 
the original round robin assay series at four laboratories indicated that these materials could be used as standards for y  la  ce  pr  nd  sm  th  and u analyses 
however  the results also indicated that the concentration of the remaining elements in the ree series were at the lower end of the working range of the analytical method  and standard values gave unacceptable accuracy and precision for eu  gd  tb  dy  ho  er  tm  yb  and lu analyses 
the company conducted a new round robin standard certification program during the first half of the current year 
the results from most recent round robin assay series qualify the reference materials for a greater number of rare earth elements 
improvements in analytical methods  and a larger base of certification analyses generated by utilizing eight analytical laboratories  indicates that the standards can be used as reference materials for au  y  la  ce  pr  nd  sm  eu  gd  tb  dy  ho  th  and u analyses 
ree drill program the ree drilling program commenced in mid june at the company s bear lodge ree project in wyoming 
four core drilling rigs are currently on the project site and will be used to test ree mineralization at the bull hill and whitetail ridge resource areas  and at the bull hill west  east taylor  and carbon ree target areas 
the program to test the ree mineralization will consist of approximately angle drill holes to general depths of to  feet 
the ree drilling program will be augmented by geological mapping  geophysical surveys  soil and rock chip geochemical surveys  and additional bulk sampling of near surface mineralized material

mineral resources the company reported an ni compliant inferred mineral resource estimate for the sundance gold project on march  the gold mineral resource estimate was prepared by ore of lakewood  colorado 
drill hole database compilation and mineral resource estimation following compilation of the sundance drill hole database  ore analyzed the data to determine the size  shape  and internal continuity of the three principal gold deposits in order to calculate inferred mineral resources

these wireframe models will also be utilized to design the optimal placement of new drill holes to be completed in the east and west breccias of the smith deposit were discovered by fmc  and subsequently explored by international curator and coca mines coca 
in  coca estimated a historical mineral resource of million tons million metric tonnes at a grade of ounces of gold per ton g t  not ni compliant for the two deposits 
the company is not treating the historical estimate as ni defined mineral resources verified by a qualified person  and the historical estimate should not be relied upon 
the new ore mineral resource estimate updates this historical mineral resource to the current standards and incorporates the drilling done during the past several years by rare element resources and newmont mining company 
the new smith mineral resource includes million tonnes grading grams of gold tonne at a cutoff of g t table

mineral resources are estimated using inverse distance power idp estimation within dimensional wireframe models based on the geologic interpretation and continuous mineralization above an approximate ppm au cutoff grade 
drill holes were composited to meter intervals for mineral resource estimation and were capped  after compositing  at ppm au for all deposits except for smith  which was capped at ppm au 
all mineral resources are classified as inferred mineral resource as defined by cim and referenced in ni floating cone studies at a range of gold prices are used to demonstrate the potential for economic extraction of the mineral resource 
the floating cone studies are not considered to be an economic study and should not be relied upon as an economic study 
floating cone parameters include pit slope of degrees  mining cost of tonne ore and tonne waste  processing and pad costs of tonne ore  g a costs of tonne ore  and gold recovery of percent 
these parameters are believed to be reasonable  order of magnitude estimates for a low cost  run of mine  heap leaching operation 
cautionary note to us investors in this annual report we use the terms mineral resource  measured mineral resource  indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource  which are geological and mining terms as defined in accordance with ni under the guidelines adopted by cim  as cim standards in mineral resources and reserve definition and guidelines adopted by the cim 
us investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above 
mineral resources are not reserves mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
mineral resource estimates do not account for mineability  selectivity  mining loss and dilution 
these mineral resource estimates are in the inferred mineral resource category 
inferred mineral resources are normally considered too speculative geologically for the application of economic considerations that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves  however they are allowed to be included in a preliminary economic assessment 
there is also no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be converted to measured and indicated mineral resource categories through further drilling  or into mineral reserves once economic considerations are applied 
cautionary note to us investors us investors in particular are advised to read carefully the definitions of these terms as well as the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above
