item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i automotive  ii communications  iii industrial  medical and military  and iv digital consumer 
our primary products are low and medium density dram in both package and known good die kgd form and high speed and low power sram 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from our dram and sram products 
sales of our dram products have represented a majority of our net sales in each year since fiscal in january  we formed a separate business unit  giantec semiconductor  inc giantec which designs and markets application specific standard products assp primarily eeproms and smartcards 
as part of this formation  giantec raised approximately million from an outside investor 
on december   giantec received an additional direct investment of million from outside investors  and as a result our ownership interest was reduced to approximately and we were required to deconsolidate giantec 
in august  we sold approximately of our shares in giantec and on august   giantec merged with maxllent corp 
thereby reducing our ownership interest in giantec to approximately 
our consolidated financial statements reflect accounting for giantec on a consolidated basis from january  through december  for the period from december  through august   we accounted for giantec on the equity method and our results included our percentage share of giantec s results of operations 
effective september   we account for giantec on the cost basis 
on january   we acquired si en integration holdings limited si en  a privately held fabless provider of high performance analog and mixed signal integrated circuits headquartered in xiamen  china 
si en targets the mobile communications  digital consumer  networking  and automotive markets with high quality analog products 
si en s current products include audio power amplifiers  led drivers  voltage converters and temperature sensors 
in order to control our operating expenses  for the past several years we have limited our headcount in the us and maintained much of our operations in taiwan and china 
we believe this strategy has enabled us to limit our operating expenses while simultaneously locating these operations closer to our manufacturing partners and our customers 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have significantly more employees in asia than we do in the us we intend to continue these strategies going forward 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
because of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of good die per wafer 
the average selling prices of our dram and sram products are sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets and have generally declined over time 
we experienced declines in the average selling prices for many of our products in fiscal and in fiscal however  the average selling prices for certain of our dram products increased in fiscal from those experienced in fiscal and these average selling price increases continued into the september quarter 
we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to market demand  market competition and the supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices could have an adverse impact on our revenue growth rate  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect our gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide for the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 
we market and sell our products in asia  the us  europe and other locations through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our sales shipped outside the us was approximately in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we measure sales location by the shipping destination 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our net sales by region are set forth in the following table 
table of contents fiscal years ended september  asia europe us other total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog may not be a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
due to the complex nature of the markets we serve and the broad fluctuations in economic conditions in the us and other countries  it is difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
most of our foundries and all of our assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars  we do have sales transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in chinese renminbi 
in addition  we have foreign operations where expenses are generally denominated in the local currency 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not adopted any hedging strategies to date 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million was principally due to an increase in unit shipments and an increase in average selling prices for certain of our dram products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  sram revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a change in product mix 
the fiscal year ended september  includes million of analog revenue from our acquisition of si en which was completed on january  as a result of our deconsolidation of giantec  our assp revenue decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to the unfavorable impact in fiscal from increased product costs for certain products partially as result of the impact of changes in the value of the new taiwan dollar relative to the us dollar which was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices for certain of our dram products 
our gross margin for fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of million and million  respectively  of products previously written down to zero carrying value 
the decrease in our gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in gross profit dollars for our assp products as a result of our deconsolidation of giantec offset by gross profit dollars contributed by our analog products as a result of our acquisition of si en 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit or improve our product mix to higher gross margin products to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  our product costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
when demand for end products have increased  such as in fiscal  foundries have raised wafer prices 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be 
table of contents sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of million can be attributed to a million increase in research and development expenses for our analog products as a result of our acquisition of si en partially offset by a million decrease in research and development expenses as a result of our deconsolidation of giantec 
in addition  approximately million of the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to the impact of changes in the value of the new taiwan dollar relative to the us dollar as a majority of our research and development expenses are incurred in taiwan 
in addition  testing fees and other product development costs increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect the dollar amount of our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal and expect such expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales depending on our overall level of sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million can be attributed to an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  an increase in sales commissions of million as a result of higher commissionable revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase of million as a result of our acquisition of si en in fiscal partially offset by a million decrease in expenses as a result of our deconsolidation of giantec in fiscal in addition  approximately million of the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to the impact of changes in the value of the new taiwan dollar relative to the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal includes approximately million in legal expenses in connection with our acquisition of si en 
we expect the dollar amount of our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal and expect such expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales depending on our overall level of sales 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million of interest and other income in fiscal was comprised of million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility  foreign exchange gains of approximately million  million from our equity interest in giantec and interest income of million offset in part by other items 
the million of interest and other income in fiscal was comprised of million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility  foreign exchange gains of approximately million and interest income of million offset in part by other items 
gain on sale of investments 
the gain on the sale of investments was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we sold an investment and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  we sold all of our shares of ralink for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal the income tax benefit was due to the release of valuation allowances for federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of approximately million offset by the income tax provision of million of foreign taxes on certain income earned by our foreign entities and some miscellaneous state income taxes 
the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal was based on our evaluation of historical evidence  trends in profitability and expectations of future taxable income 
as such  we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary for the majority of our us and for certain foreign deferred tax assets because  based on the available evidence  realization of these net deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
a valuation allowance remains on certain u 
s and foreign deferred tax assets where the estimated realization is not as certain 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of million that was principally comprised of foreign taxes on certain income earned by our foreign entities  state income taxes reduced by a refund of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes and a reversal of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was signed into law 
one of the provisions in such act allows a taxpayer  at the taxpayer election  to carryback either its  or net operating losses   or years whereas  generally  net operating losses can only be carried back up to years 
these net operating loss carryback provisions allow for the recovery of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million was principally due to a significant increase in unit shipments and an increase in average selling prices for certain of our dram products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  unit shipments of both our sram products and our application specific standard products assp which include our eeprom  smart card and logic products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to an improvement in product mix  the effect of better pricing in certain target markets  cost reductions for certain products and the favorable impact in fiscal from the sales of items previously written down to lower of cost or market combined with a decrease in inventory write downs 
our gross margin for fiscal included inventory write downs of million while our gross margin for fiscal included inventory write downs of million 
the inventory write downs were for excess and obsolescence issues and lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products 
our gross margin for fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of million and million  respectively  of products previously written down to zero carrying value 
the increase in our gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in unit shipments across all our products but more significantly for our dram products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of million can be attributed to an increase in expenditures for masks  other product development costs and an increase in headcount related expenses associated with our acquisition of enable

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million can be attributed to an increase in sales commissions in fiscal as a result of our higher revenue and an increase in payroll related expenses 
in addition  fiscal reflects expenses for our employee profit sharing program which was implemented at the beginning of fiscal acquired in process technology charge 
in fiscal  we incurred a million acquired in process technology ipr d charge in connection with our acquisition of enable 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed in fiscal as it was deemed to have no future alternative use

gain on sale of investments 
the gain on the sale of investments was million in fiscal as we sold all of our shares of ralink for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  there were no gains on the sale of investments 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of million for fiscal which was principally comprised of foreign taxes on certain income earned by our foreign entities  state income taxes reduced by a refund of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes and a reversal of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was signed into law 
one of the provisions in such act allows a taxpayer  at the taxpayer s election  to carryback either its  or net operating losses   or years whereas  generally  net operating losses can only be carried back up to years 
these net operating loss carryback provisions allow for the recovery of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  consisting of a federal refundable credit  offset by state minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 

table of contents net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was income of  in fiscal compared to a loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities provided cash of approximately million compared to million provided in fiscal the cash provided by operations in was primarily due to our net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million and decreases in accounts receivable of million 
this was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of million  decreases in accrued liabilities of million  increases in inventories of million and increases in other assets of million 
the cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to our net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million  increases in accounts payable of million and increases in accrued liabilities of million 
this was offset by increases in inventory of million  increases in accounts receivable of million  million for long term deposits to secure foundry capacity and increases in other assets of million 
in fiscal  we used million for investing activities compared to million generated from investing activities in fiscal the cash used in fiscal included million net of the cash acquired for the acquisition of si en  a million cash impact from the deconsolidation of giantec  million for the acquisition of property  equipment and leasehold improvements  million to collateralize accounts payable to a supplier and million for net purchases of available for sale securities 
in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of approximately of our shares of giantec resulting in no gain and million from the sale of an investment resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of trading securities  million from the net sales of available for sale securities and approximately million from the sale of shares of ralink 
we also received approximately million from the third party investors in our consolidated subsidiary giantec 
in fiscal  we used million to collateralize accounts payable to a supplier and million for the acquisition of property  equipment and leasehold improvements 
in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for test equipment  engineering tools  and computer software and hardware compared to million in fiscal we expect to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of additional test equipment  design and engineering tools  and computer hardware 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we used million for financing activities in fiscal compared to million generated from financing activities during fiscal in fiscal  we used million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock and million for the repayment of short term borrowings 
our sources of financing in fiscal were borrowings of million under short term lines of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
our source of financing for fiscal was proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we used million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock 
we have million available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
these lines of credit expire at various times through june as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under these short term lines of credit 
we lease approximately  square feet of office space in san jose for our headquarters and the lease on this building expires in june outside of the us  we have operations in leased sites in china and hong kong 
in addition to these sites  we lease sales offices in the us  europe and asia 
these leases expire at various dates through in taiwan  we own and occupy our building and the land upon which our building is situated is leased under an operating lease that expires in march our outstanding commitments under these leases were approximately million at september  we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to the replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 

table of contents our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations with wafer foundries acquisition related liability total contractual cash obligations at september   we had outstanding authorization from our board to purchase up to million of our common stock from time to time 
we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also commit to acquisitions or equity investments  including strategic investments in or prepayments to wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we enter into such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  iv accounting for acquisitions and goodwill  which impacts operating expense when we record impairments v accounting for stock based compensation which impacts costs of goods sold  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense and vi accounting for income taxes 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult 
for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report on form k 
valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining the market value of inventories on hand and at distributors as of the balance sheet date involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
when market values are below our costs  we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventories to their estimated market value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when the written down products are sold 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand that has aged over one year two years for wafer and die bank to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products  planned inventory increases or strategic customer supply 
in 
table of contents making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and allowances 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the allowance for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method 
under this method  the total consideration paid is allocated over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including in process research and development  with any excess allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the net assets 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
management is responsible for the valuation of tangible and intangible assets 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  the useful lives are estimated by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and unique factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include developed and in process technology  customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements 
the amounts allocated to ipr d projects are not expensed until technological feasibility is reached for each project 
upon completion of development for each project  the acquired ipr d will be amortized over its useful life 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from three to eight years 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where indicators of impairment may exist 
for instance  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock option fair value is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected term  volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rates that determine the stock option fair value 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
we estimate our expected forfeitures rate based on our historical activity and judgment regarding trends 
we estimate the expected term for option grants based upon historical exercise data 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected life was more reasonable than our current method  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated could change materially 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us and foreign taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

table of contents we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign countries  and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in certain of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgment and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions and believe that our provision for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate based on information currently available to us 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
our overall provision requirement could change due to the issuance of new regulations or new case law  management judgments on undistributed foreign earnings including judgments about and intentions concerning our future operations  negotiations with tax authorities  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  or the entire audit  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards during fiscal  we adopted the following accounting standard which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations during such period or financial condition at the end of such period intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb amended its standards to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the amendment  an entity will be permitted to use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  the amendment eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards 
the amendment is effective for our fiscal year beginning october   however we early adopted the amendment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the following accounting pronouncements were issued during fiscal  but were not effective for us during fiscal business combinations in december  the fasb amended its guidance on business combinations 
under the amended guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period 
the amendment is effective prospectively for business combinations on or after our fiscal year beginning october  the impact of the amendment will depend on the nature and extent of our business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of fiscal intangibles goodwill and other in december  the fasb amended its guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amendment modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this amendment is effective for our fiscal year beginning october  we do not anticipate that this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement in may  the fasb amended its guidance to converge fair value measurement and disclosure guidance in us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board 
the amendment changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for many of the requirements  the fasb does not intend for the amendment to result in a change in the application of the requirements in the current authoritative guidance 
the amendment is effective for our interim period beginning january  we do not anticipate that the amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
comprehensive income in june  the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this amendment eliminates the currently available option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
under this amendment  an entity will have the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the 
table of contents components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  this amendment  requires that an entity present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the amendment becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and is to be applied retrospectively 
this amendment will impact the presentation of other comprehensive income but will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
we do not anticipate the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
however  we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india  japan  korea and singapore where our expenses are denominated in each country s local currency and are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in fiscal  we recorded exchange gains of approximately million 
in fiscal  we recorded exchange gains of approximately million 
we could be negatively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
in the future  if we feel our foreign currency exposure has significantly increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million at september  these funds were primarily invested in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
we believe a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
investments in publicly traded companies 
we own ordinary shares in smic which has been a publicly traded company since march our investment in smic is classified as an available for sale investment and is recorded at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost basis of our shares in smic is approximately million and the market value at september  was approximately million and is included in short term investments 
the market value of smic shares is subject to fluctuations and our carrying value will be subject to adjustments to reflect changes in smic s market value in future periods 
the fair value of our smic stock would be approximately million or million  respectively  based on a hypothetical percent increase or percent decrease in smic s stock price 
in the event the decline in the market value of our smic shares below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to recognize a loss on our investment through our operating results
