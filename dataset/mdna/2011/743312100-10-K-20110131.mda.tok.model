risk factors of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global enterprise software company that enables organizations to achieve higher levels of business performance by improving operational responsiveness 
operational responsiveness is the ability of business processes and systems to respond to changing business conditions and customer interactions as they occur 
we offer a portfolio of best in class  real time software solutions providing enterprises with significantly improved operational responsiveness within all events and activities that they participate

rpm enables enterprises to achieve a higher level of business performance 
we also provide enterprise data solutions data access and integration and application development platforms for application development and management  and saas enablement 
we maximize the benefits of operational responsiveness while minimizing information technology it complexity and total cost of ownership 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
these operations are primarily conducted in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar significantly impact our results of operations 
in the first three quarters of fiscal  the strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies negatively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the first six months of fiscal  the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies positively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
in the last six months of fiscal  the stronger us dollar against most major currencies negatively affected the translation of our results into us dollars 
for fiscal  we reorganized our segment reporting into three business units application development platforms  enterprise business solutions and enterprise data solutions 
our business units represent our segments for financial reporting purposes 
however  our organization is managed primarily on a functional basis 
we assign dedicated costs and expenses directly to each business unit 
we utilize an allocation methodology to assign all other costs and expenses to each business unit 
a significant portion of the total costs and expenses assigned to each business unit are allocated 
we disclose revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods 
our product lines are synonymous with our reportable segments or business units 
for an understanding of how our internal measure of product line revenue is determined  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
our product lines comply with open standards  deliver high levels of performance and scalability and provide a low total cost of ownership 
our products are generally sold as perpetual licenses  but certain product lines and business activities also utilize term and subscription licensing models 
see item in this form k for further description of our business units 
on january   we acquired savvion  inc  a privately held business enterprise software company based in santa clara  california  for million 
savvion is a provider of business process management software 
the savvion products became part of our enterprise business solutions segment 
our acquisition strategy has been to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions in fiscal the results for fiscal reflect aggregate restructuring charges of million taken in connection with previously announced restructurings of our operations during the first and third quarters 
the restructurings were undertaken to enhance and re focus our product strategy  to improve the way we take our products to market by becoming more customer and solutions driven  and to increase our market awareness 
to accomplish these goals  and with a view toward better optimizing operations and improving productivity and efficiency  we reduced our global workforce by approximately percent in the first quarter restructuring and percent in the third quarter restructuring  primarily within our sales  development and administrative organizations 
these workforce reductions were conducted across all geographies and also resulted in a consolidation of offices in certain locations 

table of contents we also have undertaken an initiative to increase investment and expand development and administration operations in india  where we have run a successful development organization for several years 
we expect to increase the size of our development organization in hyderabad  india  from about a third of our development resources to about half  in order to maximize resources and manage our development costs as we increase overall r d headcount and bandwidth in our key product areas 
therefore  over the next twelve months  we expect to move and add additional product group functions as well as certain administrative functions to india 
this expansion in india will result in the reduction of our development and administration operations headcount in all other geographies in which we operate 
in addition  we intend to continue the consolidation of some of our offices around the world 
through these initiatives  we expect to incur aggregate future pre tax restructuring charges and pre tax non recurring transition expenses of approximately million to million over the next twelve months  primarily comprising of costs for severance  transition costs and consolidation of facilities 
the transition expenses are necessary to ramp up the new  more efficient capabilities ahead of switching over from the existing cost structure 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
we see the most significant risks for fiscal continuing to be the macroeconomic climate  which could cause our customers to delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a nonrecurring benefit of million recorded in fiscal the nonrecurring tax benefit related to a change in estimate of our foreign earnings and profits utilized to determine the tax characterization of certain international cash repatriation  partially offset by resolution of certain of our uncertain tax positions related to netting of intercompany balances 
the decrease was also due to the mix of profit within our various tax jurisdictions  partially offset by a reduction in our research and development credit in fiscal as the credit provisions in the tax code expired at the end of december the research and development credit was reinstated in the tax code in december with a retroactive effective date of january   and we currently estimate the tax benefit in fiscal to be approximately million

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the distribution of income in non us jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for further information 
liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments at the end of fiscal  our cash and short term investments totaled million 
the increase of million since the end of fiscal was primarily due to cash generated from operations and issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash used for the acquisition of savvion and share repurchases 
there are no limitations on our ability to access our cash and short term investments 
auction rate securities in addition to the million of cash and short term investments  we had investments with a fair value of million related to auction rate securities ars that are classified as long term investments 
these ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities that were marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at primarily or day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the remaining contractual maturities of these securities range from to years 
the underlying collateral of the ars consist of municipal bonds  which are insured by monoline insurance companies  and student loans  which are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp and by the monoline insurance companies 
beginning in february  auctions for these securities began to fail  and the interest rates for these ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering document 
at november   our ars investments classified as long term investments totaled million at par value 
during fiscal  noncurrent ars totaling million were redeemed at par by the issuers  resulting in a net reduction of the par value of our ars investments classified as long term investments to million 
these ars are classified as available for sale securities 
during fiscal  a total of million of ars classified as trading securities were repurchased at par by ubs  the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of these ars 
for each of the ars classified as available for sale  we evaluated the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecasted the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or a redemption at par for each future auction period 
the weighted average cash flow for each period was then discounted back to present value for each security 
based on this methodology  we determined that the fair value of our non current ars investments is million at november   and we have recorded a temporary impairment charge in accumulated other comprehensive income of million to reduce the value of our available for sale ars investments 
we will not be able to access these remaining funds until a future auction for these ars is successful  we sell the securities in a secondary market  or they are redeemed by the issuer 
as such  these remaining investments currently lack short term liquidity and are therefore classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet at november  based on our cash and short term investments balance of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity associated with these ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the affected securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
therefore  the impairment on these securities is considered only temporary in nature 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates significantly  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars through an impairment charge 

table of contents cash flows from operations we generated cash from operations of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the components of our cash flows from operations for fiscal years  and are as follows in thousands year ended november  net income depreciation  amortization and other noncash charges tax benefit deficiency from stock plans changes in operating assets and liabilities total the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal were affected by the payments of assumed liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of iona 
our gross accounts receivable increased by million from the end of fiscal days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable increased year over year by nine days to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal we target a dso range of to days 
cash flows from investing and financing activities we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the purchases in each fiscal year consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations 
we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year   shares for million in fiscal year  and  shares for million in fiscal year we repurchased substantially all available shares under our previous board authorized share repurchase program 
on october   our board of directors authorized  for the period from october  through september   the purchase of up to million of our common stock  at such times that management deems such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
on january   we acquired savvion  inc  a privately held company  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
savvion is a provider of business process management software 
the savvion product lines became part of our enterprise business solutions business unit 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of savvion were included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
we paid the purchase price in cash from available funds 
we had no acquisitions in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed three acquisitions at a total cost of million  net of cash acquired 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies were included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
in each case  the purchase price was paid in cash from available funds 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for further information we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions during fiscal  although we can make no assurances that we will be able to identify and complete any acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy has been to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
indemnification obligations we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our 
table of contents products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
liquidity outlook we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  acquisitions  lease commitments  restructuring obligations  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
revenue backlog our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
our backlog of orders not included on the balance sheet is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements 
our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
we typically fulfill most of our software license orders within days of acceptance of a purchase order 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize software license revenue upon shipment of the product  or if delivered electronically  when the customer has the right to access the software 
because there are many elements governing when revenue is recognized  including when orders are shipped  credit approval obtained  completion of internal control processes over revenue recognition and other factors  management has some control in determining the period in which certain revenue is recognized 
we frequently have open software license orders at the end of the quarter which have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of open software license orders may vary at any time  we generally do not believe that the amount  if any  of such software license orders at the end of a particular quarter is a reliable indicator of future performance 
in addition  there is no industry standard for the definition of backlog and there may be an element of estimation in determining the amount 
as such  direct comparisons with other companies may be difficult or potentially misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations as of november  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payment on long term debt operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total this liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments  if any  which we will make related to this liability are not known 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for additional information 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
such judgments can materially impact the amount of revenue that we record in a given period 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectability 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we have goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
when we evaluate potential impairments outside of our annual measurement date  judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize either discounted cash flow models or other valuation models  such as comparative transactions and market multiples  to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of reporting units also requires management judgment 
we consider whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment based on the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by segment management 
we utilize undiscounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
income tax accounting we have a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part 
table of contents of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
management judgment is also required in evaluating whether a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  based on the weight of available evidence  indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
management judgment is also required in measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions would occur 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using either the current market price or the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount of stock based compensation would occur 
investments in debt securities we have approximately million at fair value par value of million in investments related to ars  all of which are classified as noncurrent at november  for each of our ars  we evaluate the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecast the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par  or a redemption at par  for each future auction period 
based on the results of this assessment  we record either a mark to market adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or an other than temporary impairment charge in other income in our statement of operations 
if we use different assumptions or the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our available for sale ars through an other than temporary impairment charge in current period earnings 
restructuring charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes to our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other market factors 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  and may result in revisions to established facility reserves 
recent accounting pronouncements performing step of the goodwill impairment test in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts topic intangibles goodwill and other asu 
asu amends the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
we will adopt asu in fiscal and any impairment to be recorded upon adoption will be recognized as an adjustment to our beginning retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years or interest rate resets of less than days and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale 
the available for sale classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date because changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
additionally  see further discussion regarding market risks with our investments in ars under liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
we generally use foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically a portion of forecasted international cash flows for up to one year in the future 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  british pound  brazilian real  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
all foreign currency option contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the balance sheet at the end of each reporting period and expire within one year 
in fiscal  mark to market gains of million on foreign currency option contracts were recorded in other income in the statement of operations 
we also use forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge the net assets of our international subsidiaries 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the balance sheet at the end of each reporting period and expire within days 
in fiscal  realized and unrealized losses of million from our forward contracts were recognized in other income in the statement of operations 
these losses were substantially offset by realized and unrealized gains on the offsetting positions 
foreign currency translation exposure from a movement of currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our reported revenue and net income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  our revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and our net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from our ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
