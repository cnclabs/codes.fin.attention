item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
general 
we provide software based computer enabled detection  or ced  products and solutions that use advanced signal processing software algorithms to detect and monitor objects in a designated field of view 
our technology analyzes the signal from a sophisticated sensor and passes the information along to management systems  controllers or directly to users 
our core products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system  rtms radar detection system and citysync automatic number plate recognition anpr system  operate using our proprietary application software in conjunction with video cameras or radar and commonly available electronic components 
our systems are used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels and by parking and toll managers and law enforcement officials to read license plates for various safety  security  access and enforcement anpr applications 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite control products  inc  or econolite  our exclusive licensee in these regions 
we sell rtms and citysync systems to distributors and end users in north america 
we sell all of our systems to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
the majority of our sales are to end users that are funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management or traffic law enforcement 
citysync acquisition 
in june  we purchased all of the outstanding equity of citysync limited through which we own its principal product line  the citysync anpr system 
we believe the citysync acquisition expands our addressable market  strengthens our selling presence in europe and extends our opportunities for hybrid product developments 
in its fiscal year ended january   citysync had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to anpr system sales 
eis asset purchase 
in  we purchased certain assets from eis electronic integrated systems inc  or eis  including its principal product line  the rtms system 
in its fiscal year ended september   eis had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to rtms sales 
trends and challenges in our business we believe the growth in our business can be attributed primarily to the following global trends worsening traffic caused by increased numbers of vehicles in metropolitan areas without corresponding expansions of road infrastructure and the need to automate safety  security and access applications for automobiles and trucks  which has increased demand for our products  advances in information technology  which have made our products easier to market and implement  the continued funding allocations for centralized traffic management services and automated enforcement schemes  which has increased the ability of our primary end users to implement our products  and general increases in the cost effectiveness of electronics  which make our products more affordable for end users 
we believe our continued growth primarily depends upon continued adoption and governmental funding of intelligent transportation systems  or its  and other automated applications for traffic control  safety and enforcement in developed countries  a propensity by traffic engineers to implement lower cost technology based solutions rather than civil engineering solutions such as widening roadways  countries in the developing world adopting above ground detection technology  such as video or radar  instead of in pavement loop technology to manage traffic  
table of contents the use of ced to provide solutions to security surveillance and environmental issues associated with increasing automobile use in metropolitan areas  and our ability to develop new products  such as hybrid ced devices incorporating  for example  radar and video technologies  that provide increasingly accurate information and enhance the end users ability to cost effectively manage traffic  security surveillance and environmental issues 
because the majority of our end users are governmental entities  we are faced with challenges related to potential delays in purchase decisions by those entities and changes in budgetary constraints 
these contingencies could result in significant fluctuations in our revenue between periods 
the slow rate at which the worldwide recession is ending is further adding to the unpredictability of purchase decisions  creating more delays than usual and decreasing governmental budgets  and it is likely to continue to negatively affect our revenue 
we believe we will continue to be a beneficiary of the federal stimulus bills enacted in and  but it is difficult to determine the level of impact it has on our operations 
key financial terms and metrics revenue 
we derive revenue from two sources royalties received from econolite for sales of the autoscope system in north america  the caribbean and latin america and revenue received from the direct sales of our rtms and citysync systems in north america  the caribbean and latin america and all of our systems in europe and asia 
we calculate the royalties using a profit sharing model where we split with econolite the gross profit on sales of autoscope product made through econolite 
this royalty arrangement has the benefit of decreasing our cost of revenues and our selling  marketing and product support expenses because these costs and expenses are borne primarily by econolite 
although this royalty model has a positive impact on our gross margin  it also negatively impacts our total revenue  which would be higher if all the sales made by econolite were made directly by us 
the royalty arrangement is exclusive under a long term agreement 
cost of revenue 
there is no cost of revenue related to royalties  as virtually all manufacturing  warranty and related costs are incurred by econolite 
cost of revenue related to product sales consists primarily of the amount charged by our third party contractors to manufacture hardware platforms  which is influenced mainly by the cost of electronic components 
the cost of revenue also includes logistics costs and estimated expenses for product warranties and inventory reserves 
the key metric that we follow is achieving certain gross margin percentages by geographic region and to a lesser extent by product line 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses fall into three categories selling  marketing and product support  general and administrative  and research and development 
selling  marketing and product support expenses consist of various costs related to sales and support of our products  including salaries  benefits and commissions paid to our personnel  commissions paid to third parties  travel  trade show and advertising costs  second tier technical support for econolite  and general product support  where applicable 
general and administrative expenses consist of certain corporate and administrative functions that support the development and sales of our products and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses reflect management  supervisory and staff salaries and benefits  legal and auditing fees  travel  rent and costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  sarbanes oxley compliance  listing fees and annual reporting expenses 
research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our engineers and third party costs for consulting and prototyping 
we measure all operating expenses against our annually approved budget  which is developed with achieving a certain operating margin as a key focus 
also included in operating expenses are acquisition related expenses and non cash expense for intangible asset amortization 
non gaap operating measure 
we use non gaap net income  which excludes the impact  net of tax  of amortizing the intangible assets from the eis asset acquisition and the citysync acquisition and expenses related to these acquisitions  including earn out adjustments and other unusual items  to analyze our business 
management believes that this non gaap operating measure  when shown in conjunction with gaap measures  facilitates the comparison of our current operating results to historical operating results 
we use this non gaap information to evaluate short term and long term operating trends in our core operations 
further  we believe that this non gaap measure improves management s and investors ability to compare our financial performance with other companies in the technology industry 
non gaap information is not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for or an alternative to gaap financial measures and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents reconciliations of gaap net income to non gaap net income are as follows dollars in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december gaap net income adjustments to reconcile to non gaap net income amortization of intangible assets acquisition related expenses non recurring foreign tax benefit withdrawn offering expenses impact on income tax expense of amortization and acquisition expenses non gaap net income gaap diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share seasonality 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our first quarter generally is the weakest due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in north america  europe and northern asia 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
history 
we were incorporated in the state of minnesota in december and began operations by pioneering the commercial application of wide area video vehicle detection for traffic management 
the technology underlying our products was initially developed at the university of minnesota 
in  the university was awarded a patent for that technology  which it exclusively licensed to us 
in  we sub licensed this technology to econolite  a leading manufacturer and seller of traffic control products in north america and the caribbean  to manufacture and distribute products incorporating the technology 
segments 
we currently operate in three reportable segments autoscope  rtms and citysync 
autoscope is our machine vision product line  and revenue consists of royalties all of which are received from econolite  as well as a portion of international sales 
rtms is our radar product line acquired in the eis asset purchase in december citysync is our anpr product line acquired in the citysync purchase in june all segment revenues are derived from external customers 
due to the citysync acquisition and related changes in how we manage our business  we may reevaluate our segment definitions in the future 
the following tables set forth selected unaudited financial information for each of the company s reportable segments in thousands for the year ended december  autoscope rtms citysync total revenue depreciation amortization of intangible assets income loss before income taxes capital expenditures total assets for the year ended december  autoscope rtms total revenue depreciation amortization of intangible assets income before income taxes capital expenditures total assets

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively 
year ended december  product sales royalties total revenue gross margin product sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles acquisition related expenses income from operations income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in product sales was mainly due to the addition of the citysync product line in june and to a lesser extent due to improved sales of rtms in international markets 
revenue for the autoscope segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
revenue for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase resulted mainly as a result of improved sales in international markets 
gross margins for product sales decreased to in from in the decrease resulted mainly from the addition of the citysync product line  which currently earns lower margins than autoscope or rtms  and increased warranty expense for rtms  and to a lesser extent from increased pricing competition for autoscope internationally 
gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and we anticipate that gross margins for our product sales will be in the proximity of in  while we expect royalty gross margins will be in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in our selling  marketing and product support expense increased in mostly as a result of the addition of the citysync organization 
additionally  we invested in market expansion activities in europe and asia  including adding senior management 
we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will increase both in terms of dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in  as compared to  as we realize the full year impact of citysync related expense and continue to invest in market expansion activities 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the general and administrative expenses increased in mainly as a result of the addition of the citysync organization and to a lesser extent due to increased compensation and benefits 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in terms of dollar amount in as compared to research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was mainly related to the addition of the citysync engineering organization 
we anticipate that research and development expense will increase in terms of dollar amount in as compared to 
table of contents amortization of intangibles expense was million in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in both the eis asset purchase and the citysync acquisition 
assuming there are no changes to our intangible assets  we anticipate amortization expense will be approximately million in other income expense was an expense of  in  primarily consisting of interest expense  as opposed to income of  in mainly due to higher debt balances in including a portion related to citysync 
income before income taxes for the autoscope segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was mainly due to increased competition 
income before income taxes for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher revenues in the segment  which were partially offset by increased warranty expense 
our income tax effective rate was in compared to in the effective rate was positively impacted by increased tax credits for research and development activities 
we expect the effective rate in to be below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
royalty income decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
we attribute the decrease in royalties to the economic recession in north america and its negative impact on state and federal spending 
product sales decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was mainly due to weakness in the asian market in the first half of revenue for the autoscope segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease related to lower royalties and weakness in asia as discussed above 
revenue for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase resulted mainly as a result of improved sales in north america 
gross margins for product sales increased to in from in the increase resulted mainly from the increase in rtms revenue  which typically earns higher margins than autoscope  and to a lesser extent from fewer lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory in as compared to gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the selling  marketing and product support expense increased in as we invested in market expansion activities in europe and asia and realized the impact of headcount additions made late in general and administrative expense decreased to million or of total revenue in  down from million or of total revenue in the general and administrative expenses decrease in resulted mainly from lower incentive pay expense and higher foreign currency transaction gains  which were partially offset by increased professional services expense 
research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to our investment in video radar hybrid solutions and tailored international offerings  development projects to reduce manufacturing costs  and the realization of the impact of headcount additions made late in amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase 
other income decreased to  in from  in mainly due to lower interest rates 
in  other income fell due to lower cash and investment balances  lower interest rates and interest expense on debt incurred for the eis asset purchase 
income before income taxes for the autoscope segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was mainly due to lower gross margins and higher investments in market expansion activities in the segment 
income before income taxes for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher revenues in the segment  which were partially offset by increased expenses  a majority of which were caused by the us dollar weakening over the course of against the canadian dollar 
our income tax effective rate was in compared to in the effective rate was positively impacted by the realization of  in foreign tax credits whose status was uncertain prior to liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments at december  
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  as compared to  we had increased accounts and other receivables outstanding  the majority of which related to citysync activity 
the primary reasons for the change compared to were lower net income and increased inventory balances that were offset by decreased accounts receivable outstanding 
in  investment balances were similar to those of we anticipate that average receivable collection days in will be similar to and that it will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
our planned additions of property and equipment are discretionary  and we do not expect them to exceed historical levels in we used million of cash in to acquire citysync including repaying seller loans 
this was mostly offset by our secondary offering which provided million in cash  net of offering expenses 
in december  we entered into a term loan agreement for million with associated bank  national association  or associated bank  which we fully repaid in september we previously had a separate million term note with associated bank that originated in may and was fully repaid in february we also have a revolving line of credit agreement with associated bank 
the revolving line of credit provides for up to million at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus  as reset from time to time by the bank 
advances on the line of credit cannot exceed a borrowing base determined under a formula  which is a percentage of the amounts of eligible receivables 
the line of credit currently has no borrowings outstanding and matures on may  we believe that on an ongoing basis  we will have regular availability to draw a minimum of million on our line of credit based on our qualifying assets 
in conjunction with our acquisition of citysync  the sellers have an earn out arrangement over approximately months from the june date of purchase 
the earn out is based on achieving certain revenue and minimum gross margins from the sale of citysync anpr systems and it is calculated in two separate periods  each ending on december in each period there are two tiers and superior performance could lead to a total earn out of million or higher  as the earn out is not capped 
earn out payments are due within three months of the end of an earn out period 
based on the results  the sellers are entitled to receive a  earn out for the first period which ran from the june acquisition date to december  the payment is expected to be made in march  and a liability has been recorded on our balance sheet as of december  as part of the recognition of the liability  we recorded an additional  in expense as the earn out exceeded our initial estimate 
in conjunction with our eis asset purchase  the sellers had an earn out arrangement over approximately three years from the december date of purchase 
the earn out ended as of december  the earn out was based on earnings before taxes from rtms sales less related cost of revenue and operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and interest expenses  and was calculated annually 
for the first two earn out periods  the sellers of the eis assets received a total of million in earn out payments 
based on the results  the sellers are entitled to receive a million earn out for the third and final period 
the payment is expected to be made in march  and a liability has been recorded on our balance sheet as of december  we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   along with the availability of funds under our million revolving line of credit and cash provided by operating activities  will satisfy our projected working capital needs  payments under the eis and citysync earn outs  investing activities  and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
our goodwill related to our flow traffic subsidiary is tested for impairment on december of each year 
eis asset purchase rtms related goodwill is tested on october of each year 
citysync goodwill will be tested beginning in april on an annual basis  we reconcile our market value to the estimated combined fair value of our business segments and reporting units as a separate measure to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
for flow traffic  we estimate the fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of flow traffic  and the comparable market transactions method 
the future economic benefits are significantly dependent on sustaining revenue levels for all product lines 
for the rtms reporting units  we estimate fair value by using a combination of the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from the rtms product line  and the market valuation approach  where the business was compared to guideline public company price earning multiples with a significant weighting to companies in the traffic detection business 
the future economic benefits are mainly dependent on future revenue growth of the rtms product line 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december   and if flow traffic and or the rtms reporting units do not provide the future economic benefits we project  the fair value of these assets may become impaired  and we would need to record an impairment loss 

table of contents intangible assets are stated at their estimated value at the time of acquisition 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over a three to nine year period for financial reporting purposes based on their estimated useful lives 
earn outs related to the eis asset purchase are recorded as additional goodwill in the year earned 
intangible assets related to the eis asset purchase are for trade names and technology 
earn outs for the citysync acquisition were estimated at the time of the acquisition  based on projected sales and gross margins during the earn out period  and recorded on our balance sheet as a liability with an offsetting increase in goodwill 
actual earn outs that vary from the initial estimated liability result in operating expense or income in the applicable year 
intangible assets related to the citysync acquisition are for customer relationships  trade names and technology 
revenue recognition 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales shipped or delivered to its customers 
we recognize revenue from north american and international sales at the time of shipment or delivery  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded based upon historical sales returns and changes in end user demands 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on specific identification of delinquent receivables 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance as deemed necessary based on our estimate of our future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
uncertain tax positions are recognized if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and allowances have been made for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventories based on estimated future usage or actual or anticipated product line changes 
warranties 
we generally provide a standard two year warranty on product sales 
reserves to honor warranty claims are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based on historical claim information and are analyzed and adjusted periodically based on claim trends 
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
it also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation in certain disclosures  inputs  and valuation techniques used in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
we adopted all of the requirements of this update on january   its effective date  except for the new requirement regarding activity in level fair value measurements which has a later effective date under the provisions of asu and will become effective on january  adoption of this pronouncement has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  to enhance the disclosures required for financing receivables for example  loans  trade accounts receivable  notes receivable  and receivables relating to a lessor s leveraged  direct financing  and sales type leases and allowances for credit losses 
the amended disclosures are designed to provide more information to financial statement users regarding the credit quality of a creditor s financing receivables and the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses 
we adopted all of the requirements of the amended guidance on december   its effective date  except for the disclosures regarding the activity during a reporting period which will become effective january  adoption of the pronouncement has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant effect on our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into currency hedges to attempt to lower our exposure to translation gains and losses as well as to limit the impact of foreign currency translation upon the consolidation of our foreign subsidiaries 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates  if we have not hedged  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
our current greatest exposure for a negative material impact to our operations is a rising canadian dollar versus the us dollar
