these purchases generally cover production requirements for to days

inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  along with various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by the company s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are 
table of contents reasonable  the company believes that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has selected its critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on its financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are the company s processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  the reserve for warranties  and goodwill impairment 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the company s financial and operating condition 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could have an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
revenue recognition revenue related to the company s measurement equipment and related software is generally recognized upon shipment  as the company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date 
revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and where persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred  and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible 
revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support  training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
extended maintenance plan revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the plan 
the company warrants its products against defects in design  materials and workmanship for one year 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped 
costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as incurred 
revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of the company s historical technology for medical applications is recognized when the technology is used by the licensees 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory since the value of inventory that will ultimately be realized cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts to provide a basis for the determination of the reserve 
inventory is considered obsolete if the company has withdrawn those products from the market or had no sales of the product for the past months and has no sales forecasted for the next months 
inventory is considered excess if the quantity on hand exceeds months of remaining usage 
the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists 
items without an identified current or future usage are reserved in an amount equal to of the fifo cost of such inventory 
the company s products are subject to changes in technologies that may make certain of its products or their components obsolete or less competitive  which may increase its historical provisions to the reserve 
income taxes the company reviews its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income over a two year period  and tax planning strategies that it might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence of recoverability  the company establishes a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which it operates  unless it is more likely than not that it will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  the company s evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by its ability to achieve profitability and its ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is 
table of contents uncertain 
the company establishes provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as described by asc  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the ordinary course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
the company assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that gave rise to a revision become known 
reserve for warranties the company establishes at the time of sale a liability for the one year warranty included with the initial purchase price of equipment  based upon an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the warranty period 
the warranty period is measured in installation months for each major product group 
the warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by applying the actual total repair expenses for each product group in the prior period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
this repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation months of warranty for each product group to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company evaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of units remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each unit will be under warranty 
the company has a history of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  which may result in unforeseen issues that increase its warranty costs 
while such expenses have historically been within expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
indefinite life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment 
the company performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the goodwill impairment test is applied using a two step approach 
in performing the first step  the company calculates the fair values of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows dcf for each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair market value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the first step  less the fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit other than goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
management has concluded there was no goodwill impairment in the years ended december   and impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance now codified within accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation asc 
asc requires entities to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as one with the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the 
table of contents entity s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
the guidance is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period commencing after november   with early adoption prohibited 
the adoption of asc as of january  did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple delivery revenue arrangements asu 
asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements  including multiple revenue generating activities  and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments of asu also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required by asu to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require a reporting company to provide information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application permitted 
the company implemented this new standard on january  and does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements  including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures  which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements nor is it expected to have a material impact for the portion effective at year end 
in july  the fasb issued guidance to enhance disclosures about the credit quality of a creditor s financing receivables and the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses 
the amended guidance is effective for period end balances beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the amended guidance is effective for activity during a reporting period beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company expects the amended guidance to impact its disclosures in future periods  but otherwise not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  of its revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of its non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase
