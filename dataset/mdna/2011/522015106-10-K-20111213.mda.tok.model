item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
e learning and blended learning 
management and it training are primarily delivered by classroom instructors  video  and technology based training  including internet based e learning and printed means 
independent industry reports state that instructor led training continues to account for the largest portion of the it training market  representing approximately of the total market in each of the last ten years 
we believe this is because instructor led training provides the greatest focus and ability for participants to learn  practice and receive feedback on their mastery of new knowledge and skills 
course participants value the personalized interaction and problem solving with their instructor and fellow participants  and the opportunity to get expert advice on the application of the course material to their own projects 
furthermore  instructor led classroom training insulates course participants from workplace interruptions and accelerates their learning of new technologies 
however  the use of technology based it training formats  such as internet based e learning  has gained some acceptance in the it and management training and education market  largely gaining market share at the expense of other self study formats including video and printed materials 
we have continued to investigate alternate  technology based training formats and how they might effectively be integrated into our training programs 
in fiscal year  we developed learning tree anyware  our proprietary live online learning platform that integrates participants in remote locations into live class events in another location 
remote participants use an ordinary internet connection to connect to our patent pending classroom interface 
once logged in  remote anyware class participants see and hear their classroom based instructor and classmates in real time  and view the instructor s annotations on the two in class magnalearn projection screens in real time 
they are able to participate in discussions  ask questions  work in breakout sessions  and complete the same hands on exercises as their in class counterparts 
they gain the full benefit of our proprietary courseware  and achieve the same level of knowledge and skill transfer as in class participants 
through anyware  we effectively apply technology to leverage the strengths of our classroom offerings 
in fiscal year  more than  remote participants have attended our courses using learning tree anyware  a increase from fiscal year employees our executive officers have extensive experience in the training and education industry with an average of over years of experience with us and over years of relevant industry experience 
on september   we had a total of full time equivalent employees  of whom were employed outside the united states 
we also utilized the services of expert instructors to teach our courses on an as needed basis 
we consider our relations with our employees and our instructors to be good 
intellectual property rights our course development process and course titles are proprietary  and we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights

in addition to our trademarks and service marks  this annual report on form k also contains trademarks and trade names of other companies 
we own the copyright to all course materials we develop 
our copyrighted course materials are a significant differentiator of our services from those of our competitors 
our magnalearn instructional enhancement system is covered by patents in the united states and a number of foreign countries 
the magnalearn system gives learning tree instructors greater flexibility to customize and pace course presentations by allowing them to annotate  highlight and manipulate course materials on two independent projection screens  in real time 
the system also provides automated feedback to our course development resources  allowing constant improvement of courses and the ability to consistently update courses immediately on a world wide basis 
we have applied for patent protection related to our recently introduced learning tree anyware live online learning platform 
our patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us 
various events outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights  as well as to our products and services 
for example  effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our courses are delivered 
we cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar course titles or delivery methods unencumbered by our proprietary rights 
if substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others  or have to pursue claims to protect our proprietary rights 
defending against and prosecuting these claims is costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations  it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations 
changes in patent law  foreign or domestic  may have an impact on our ability to obtain patent protections 
furthermore  there is always the possibility  despite our efforts  that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable 
we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets 
the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties  or by our employees or former employees  which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets 

table of contents regulatory environment we are paid directly by the employers of learning tree course participants and do not receive funding from any government student aid or loan programs 
as a result  we do not depend on government appropriations for programs and are generally exempt from the governmental regulation of public education providers 
in contrast  providers of education to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of federal  state and international governments 
however  our results of operations could be affected by current or future licensing or regulatory requirements

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties  keeping in mind that they are not the only ones that affect us 
additional risks that we do not presently consider material  or of which we are not currently aware  may also have an adverse impact on us 
common stock price fluctuations historically  our common stock price has fluctuated  and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future 
general factors 
we believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our stock related to factors such as variations in our revenues  gross margins  earnings or other financial results  fluctuations in general conditions in the economy  our market  and the markets served by our customers  announcements of developments related to our business  announcements concerning new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in our relationships with our customers  market perceptions of new means of delivering training  such as the internet  and introductions of new technologies both by our customers and technology vendors 
in addition  prices in the stock market  particularly for technology related stocks  have been volatile in recent years 
in some cases  the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
as a result  the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock 
sales of our common stock by our founders  officers  directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of shares of our common stock 
additionally  the 
table of contents price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
in addition to the  shares outstanding as of december   as of that date we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and vesting of restricted stock units  and an additional  shares of common stock remained available for issuance of equity awards under our equity incentive plan 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
fluctuations in operating results historically  our operating results have fluctuated  and we expect fluctuations to continue in the future 
fluctuations in our historical operating results have resulted from many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the future  these or other factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease 
for example timing of course development  and sales and marketing expenditures 
we try to adjust our expenditures for course development and sales and marketing to maintain our long term profitability  including our assessment of the potential to influence future customer demand  market conditions  and other factors 
this may mean accepting reduced margins in poor economic periods  as we must commit to much of our spending before our attendees enroll in our courses 
if revenues fall short of our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenditures quickly enough to compensate for lower than anticipated revenues 
this could compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our common stock 
course scheduling and marketing activities 
the timing and content of our courses and our marketing activities can affect the number of participants who attend our courses 
some of the activities that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include the frequency of our course events  the number of weeks during which our courses can be conducted in a quarter  the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and the response to  our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  the timing of introduction of new course titles  the average length of courses  based on the current mix of course titles  which affects the average revenue per attendee  and the mix between course events held at customer locations and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins 
seasonal factors 
our quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers  which are affected by factors such as cyclic or one time budgetary considerations  factors specific to their business or industry  and weather  holiday and vacation considerations 
use of accounting estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in calculating our financial results 
as one example  we currently offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport  which allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue we recognize for each attendance in one of our courses is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the 
table of contents list price of the course taken  the average list price of all courses taken  and our estimate of the average number of courses a passport holder will actually attend 
after expiration of a training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenue previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
for example  if a passport holder attends more courses than we had estimated  we would make a negative adjustment to revenues at the expiration of that passport 
we base our estimate of the average number of course events that a training passport holder will attend on historical trends 
however  these historical trends may not accurately predict the actual number of course events that a training passport holder will attend in the future 
if average training passport attendance rates were to increase  for example  we would have to make negative adjustments to our revenue  which could be significant 
for a summary of some of our key accounting estimates  please see our critical accounting estimates and policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs incurred with ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
introductions and adoption of new technology 
our customers tend to increase their training at times when new technology is being introduced 
during periods when fewer new technologies are being introduced  demand for our training courses may decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
other factors 
other factors that may affect our operating results include competitive forces within our current and anticipated future markets  our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  general economic conditions  differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing of our courses  as well as the timing of our spending on the development of our courses and other areas  and excess capacity and or unused space in our education centers and or administrative office facilities  and our ability to sublease or find other uses for it 
all or any of these and similar factors could cause our operating results to differ substantially from the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
risks associated with technology changes if we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
changes in technology can affect our business in at least two principal ways 
first  we must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware  software and other information technologies and develop courses that effectively train customers in the technologies they use now and will use in the future 
second  we must adapt to changes in the technologies by which we can deliver training to our customers employees 
as a result of technology developments  we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to develop 
table of contents new course titles  buy new equipment  or invest in further course development software and processes to deliver our courses 
further  we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technology changes for many reasons  including misjudging the impact of technology changes  as well as financial  technological or other constraints 
a lack of adequate response on our part to changes in information technology platforms  customer preferences or software technology could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
competition if our customers decide that they prefer training offered by new or existing competitors  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
the it and management training markets are highly fragmented  with low barriers to entry 
no single competitor holds a dominant market share 
we face intense competition from both established entities and new entries in the market 
our primary competitors include internal training departments within our current and potential customers  computer hardware and software vendors and their authorized training and education center partners  independent education and training companies  academic providers  and software systems integrators 
some of our competitors offer course titles and programs similar to ours at lower prices 
in addition  some competitors have greater financial and other resources than us 
additionally  hardware and software vendors  as well as software systems integrators  may combine it education and training with sales of their products or other services  which could allow them to offer training at lower prices than we do 
furthermore  future consolidation of it vendors or training companies could have a material impact on our future operations 
the risk of outsourcing of corporate it administration and software development overseas to countries or firms not currently served by us could have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
although instructor led classroom training continues to dominate the worldwide it and management training markets  technology based education and training formats  such as internet based distance learning  have gained some acceptance 
accordingly  our future results may also depend on the extent to which the market will continue to accept instructor led it and management training and on our ability to develop and market instructor led courses that compete effectively against technology based courses offered by our competitors 
risks associated with international operations approximately half of our annual revenue is generated by courses conducted outside the united states 
therefore  if we do not adequately anticipate and respond to the risks inherent in international operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
foreign currency fluctuations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and could result in exchange losses 
we do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
even if we were to use hedging techniques in the future  we might not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations 
thus  exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

table of contents other risks associated with international operations 
additionally  our results of operations may be adversely affected by other international risks  such as difficulties in translating our courses into foreign languages  international political and economic conditions  changes in government regulation in various countries  trade barriers  difficulty in staffing our foreign offices  and in training and retaining foreign instructors  adverse income tax and transfer pricing consequences  and potential costs associated with expansion into new territories 
we expect that international revenues will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenues 
a lack of anticipation and response to the risks associated with international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
dependence on key personnel if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers  our senior managers and other key personnel 
the loss of these people  especially without advance notice  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
it is also very important that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including course instructors  to accommodate growth  new course titles and to replace personnel who leave 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  especially in information technology industries and or in certain geographic areas  and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience 
under these conditions  we could be unable to recruit  train and retain instructors and employees 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel  it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with intellectual property if substantial unauthorized use of our courses occurs or if we must defend against infringement claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and confidential information 
our course development process and course titles are proprietary and we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights 
our course materials generally do not include any mechanisms to prohibit or prevent unauthorized use 
as a result  someone could copy or otherwise obtain and use our course materials without authorization  either for educational use or to develop competing courses 
in addition  we operate in countries that do not provide protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states 
finally  our intellectual property rights will not prevent competitors from independently developing similar course titles or delivery methods 
if substantial unauthorized use of our products were to occur  our results of operations and price of our common stock could be materially adversely impacted 
we may also have to defend against claims that our current or future courses infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
if such a claim succeeded  we might have to change or eliminate courses and could be required 
table of contents to pay damages or royalties 
in addition  litigation over intellectual property rights  whether brought by us or by someone else  could be time consuming and expensive  even if we were ultimately to succeed 
accordingly  defending and prosecuting these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations  it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations 
changes in patent law  foreign or domestic  may have an impact on our ability to obtain patent protections 
furthermore  there is always the possibility  despite our efforts  that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable 
we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets 
the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties  or by our employees or former employees  which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets 
risks associated with laws and regulations laws and regulations can affect our operations and may limit our ability to operate in certain states 
providers of educational programs to the public must comply with many laws and regulations of federal  state and international governments 
generally  we are exempt from this type of regulation because we contract with the employer of the participants in our courses  and we do not participate in any federal or state student aid or loan programs 
however  state laws and regulations targeting educational providers could affect our operations in the future and could limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states 
if we were found in violation of a state s current or future licensing or regulatory requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal sanctions  including monetary penalties  and we could also be barred from providing educational services in that state 
in addition  laws and regulatory decisions in many areas other than education could also adversely affect our operations 
complying with current or future legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
we are subject to tax audits by state  federal and foreign jurisdictions 
such audits are to be expected and may result in adjustments as a result of the accretion of tax jurisdiction interpretations and changes in operational practices 
any such audits may result in additional taxes being assessed or in the refund of taxes previously paid 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
control by management senior personnel  especially our founders  own a majority of our outstanding shares and may therefore have significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions 
as of december   our executive officers and directors collectively beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as of that date  mr 
garen  our chairman of the board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
dr 
collins  our vice chairman of the board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  consequently  senior personnel  and mr 
garen and dr 
collins in particular  have significant influence over  and may control  our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
these may include  for example  the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our corporate documents and the approval of mergers and sales of our assets 

table of contents risks associated with possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions if we cannot successfully implement any future acquisitions or other strategic transactions  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
on occasion  we evaluate business opportunities and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
we could decide to pursue one or more of these opportunities by acquisition or internal development 
acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve many risks  including the difficulty of integrating acquired technologies  operations and personnel with our existing operations  the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services  the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures  our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  and the loss of key employees of an acquired operation 
in addition  an acquisition or other strategic transactions could adversely impact cash flows and or operating results  and dilute shareholder interests  for many reasons  including charges to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  write offs for the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture  and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transactions that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current common stockholders 
we have had no significant experience in executing and implementing acquisitions 
although we have implemented other strategic transactions  those ventures have not always been successful  and we may not succeed in the future 
the risks associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 
risks associated with changing economic conditions general domestic and international economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and common stock price 
as a result of the current economic uncertainty and macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  some of our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases of courses from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen 
domestic and or international economic downturns 
a significant part of our revenues comes from fortune level companies  their international equivalents  and government organizations 
during weak economic conditions  our sales grow more slowly or can even diminish 
if the domestic and or international economy were to continue to weaken  the demand for our services could decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
industry specific slowdowns 
our customers generally operate in the finance  computer  communications  electronics  systems integration  aerospace  government and military  manufacturing  and energy sectors 
when one or more of these industries experiences a slowdown  it can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 

table of contents globalization issues 
our operations are concentrated in europe and north america  which have traditionally been the centers of it development and implementation 
in recent years  there has been increasing it activity in other parts of the world  such as china and india 
if this trend adversely affects it jobs in regions in which we have our principal operations  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
anti takeover provisions certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could adversely impact the interests of our stockholders 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately  discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might benefit our stockholders 
these provisions may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of our common stock 
some examples of these provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws are the division of our board of directors into three classes  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the common stock  without prior stockholder approval  certain limitations of the rights of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and the prohibition of stockholder actions by written consent 
natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external events since our founding in  various natural disasters  external labor disruptions  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external factors have from time to time impaired our ability to conduct our business  resulted in the loss of revenue or otherwise affected our operating results 
when these or other external events occur in the future  they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
natural disasters 
natural disasters can affect our business 
for example  severe weather has at times prevented our course participants from traveling to our courses 
in these situations  we try to transfer the course participants to later courses  but we may still lose some revenue 
similarly  both weather and floods have also disrupted the printing and transportation of the catalogs we use in our direct mail campaigns 
the resulting delays in our mailings may reduce or delay the revenue we realize from courses listed in those catalogs 
external strikes 
we have had to react to postal  transportation  and other strikes in the countries where we operate 
postal strikes delay or reduce the delivery of our direct mail marketing materials  which may result in reduced enrollments in upcoming course events 
transportation strikes can make it difficult for our course participants or our instructors to reach course facilities 
although we try to employ strategies to mitigate the impact of external strikes  these alternative means are rarely completely effective and generally increase our costs  which could adversely affect our operating results 
acts of war or terrorism 
threats or acts of war or terrorism can adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   the declaration of war by the united states against terrorism  and continuing hostilities in the middle east and elsewhere have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world 
these and future events may have a material adverse effect on world financial markets  including financial markets in the united states 
in addition  threats or acts of war or terrorism can cause course participants to be reluctant regarding or prevented from traveling to our course facilities  thereby resulting in lower attendance rates 
additionally  our direct mail marketing materials may be delayed or disrupted from reaching our customers  and suppliers and service providers may be unable to provide required services or 
table of contents materials 
these impacts could happen after we have committed to all the costs of our course  so that we would be unable to quickly adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues caused by these events  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
other external factors 
other factors outside our control can affect our operations  including those related to our suppliers and service providers 
for example  disruptions of telephone networks can prevent customers from enrolling in our courses  disruptions in transportation services can prevent customers from reaching our facilities  and power outages can prevent us from delivering courses 
similarly  if commodities for example  the paper used in the printing of our catalogs that we or our customers need become scarce or more expensive  our operating results may be adversely affected

overview nature of the business 
learning tree international is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training and education to business and government organizations for their managers and it professionals 
since our founding in  we have provided high quality training to over million managers and it professionals 
in fiscal year we trained  course participants from more than  organizations worldwide  including large national and multinational companies  government organizations  and small and medium size companies 
as of september   we offered a broad proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from one to five days in length  consisting of different course titles representing  hours of training  including it course titles and management course titles 
learning tree courses provide both breadth and depth of education and training across a wide range of technical and management disciplines  including operating systems  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  web development  programming languages  software engineering  open source applications  project management  business skills  leadership and professional development 
we market and present our courses through locally staffed operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan and generate approximately half of our revenues internationally 
we coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at our own education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  we presented courses in countries 
our proprietary live online learning platform  learning tree anyware  allows individuals located anywhere in the world to use their internet browser to participate online in instructor led classes being conducted live in learning tree education centers or at customer locations 
during fiscal year  more than  remote participants attended anyware course sessions  an increase of compared with our prior fiscal year 
we use a well defined systematic approach to develop and update the learning tree course library so as to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
after assessing market need  courses are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
our proprietary course development process also allows us to customize our courses for delivery at our customers sites 
we design our own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective regarding software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors 
all learning tree courses are highly interactive  and incorporate extensive hands on exercises or case study workshops 
while addressing core concepts and theory  all of our technical and management courses focus primarily on providing skills  tools  and technologies that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
to accomplish this objective  many of our realityplus management courses utilize extensive multi media simulations to teach practical management techniques 
this innovative methodology provides an environment in which realityplus course participants learn entirely by doing 
throughout these courses  they gain extensive experience applying new management skills in life like  challenging situations  within the confines of the classroom and under the guidance of an expert instructor 
as a result  realityplus course participants can achieve greater mastery of effective management techniques as well as the confidence needed to apply them  and thus return to their jobs both ready and willing to immediately apply their expanded skills in their workplaces 

table of contents we had instructors as of september   who are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge  and who average nearly years of hands on  real world experience 
learning tree instructors teach an average of approximately course events per year on an as needed basis 
during the rest of the year they apply the skills that they teach  either as full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors are using and honing their management and it skills as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
we have structured our business so that the majority of our course delivery costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
we schedule our course events throughout the year based on our assessment of demand 
since learning tree instructors typically work full time or as consultants for other business and industry employers  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  they teach our course events as needed and thus  our instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  expenses associated with our own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
we adjust our expenditures for sales and marketing depending on our strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of our expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if our expectations regarding the results of our marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as we have for the past years  we continue to emphasize excellence in educating and training managers and it professionals from government and commercial organizations around the world 
we believe that quality is a significant differentiator in the eyes of our customers  and that our proven long term record of exceptional performance is a reason for our clients tremendous loyalty 
every one of our largest clients five years ago in fiscal year was still one of our clients five years later in fiscal year we continue our emphasis on excellence by focusing on our core strengths our expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms  application of technology to education  and worldwide course delivery systems 
we follow a or week fiscal year 
our year end and quarter end dates are on the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  our fiscal year ended on october   fiscal year ended on october  and fiscal year ended on september  our fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended october  october  september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our revenues increased to million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations was level at million in fiscal years and net income for fiscal year decreased to million compared to million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues increased by compared to fiscal year the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of participants in our courses and a increase in average revenue per participant 
the increase in revenue per participant was primarily the result of an overall price increase of and a favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates of 
additionally  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year we had a higher percentage of participants at courses held at our own education centers  where the average revenue per participant is higher than for courses held at customer locations  which increased revenue per participant by 
during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  an increase of from  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a decrease from  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a increase from  attendee days in fiscal year revenues in the united states decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a reduction in the number of course events presented at customer locations 
revenues from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a increase in the number of course participants in our international locations and a increase in average revenue per participant in those locations 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
during fiscal year  we presented  events compared to  events during fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues decreased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year was due to a decrease in average cost per event  that resulted from small reductions across a broad variety of expense categories 
gross profit in the united states stayed the same at million in fiscal year and gross profit from our international operations increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in our revenues from our international locations this year compared to fiscal year  as discussed earlier 
course development expenses 
we maintain a disciplined process to develop new courses and update our existing courses 
all costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred and are included in course development expenses 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during fiscal year in fiscal year  we increased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this net increase reflected an increase in personnel and benefits expense of million and an increase in royalty expense due to an increase in attendee days of million offset by decreases in other course development expenses 

table of contents we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year during fiscal year we introduced new it courses compared with in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the increase in the number of titles in fiscal year reflected the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at september   we had management titles in our course library  compared with management titles at the end of fiscal year our library of it titles numbered as of september   the same as at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail and media advertisements  marketing e mails and our website  compensation and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  and the cost of information systems to support these activities 
our sales and marketing expense  and in particular our expenditure on course catalogs  is one of our largest expenditures 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the overall increase of million was due to increases of million for personnel and benefits  million for trade shows and advertising and million for severance 
these increases were offset by decreases of catalog production costs of million  sales commissions of million  professional service fees of million  recruiting fees of million and various other expenses of million 
changes in foreign exchange rates caused our overall sales and marketing expenses to increase by about 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased by million  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this change from our prior year expenses resulted mainly from increases of million in personnel and benefits expense  million for legal fees  million due to changes in foreign exchange rates  million for the fiscal year reversal of an asset retirement obligation from the renegotiation of a lease  and million in other general and administrative expenses 
these increases were offset by million in cost reductions  principally due to a million reduction in onerous lease provisions compared to the prior year 
the increase in personnel and benefits expense primarily resulted from increases of million of incentive compensation as very little incentive compensation was paid in our prior year  million for annual compensation increases  million as a result of additional personnel  million in benefits primarily related to the aforementioned salary increases  million in severance expense  and million for stock related compensation and other expenses 
fiscal year included a charge of million for an expected period of vacancy due to the exercise of an option to terminate by one of our london education center subtenants on october  an additional charge of million for vacant space was taken in fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million 
this change was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million due to lower interest rates 

table of contents income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the lower effective rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the expiration of uncertain tax positions which resulted in a million reduction in our tax expense 
we did not provide for united states federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of september   because we currently intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of september  because of the availability of united states foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year our fiscal year began october   and from the outset was significantly impacted by the global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn 
in fiscal year  our revenues decreased by to million compared to million in fiscal year income from operations increased by to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year increased by to million compared to million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues decreased by compared to fiscal year the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the number of participants in our courses and a decrease in average revenue per participant 
the decrease in revenue per participant was primarily the result of the fact that in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  we had a higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations  where the average revenue per participant is lower than for courses held in our own education centers  as well as a higher percentage of participants at our management courses  which have a shorter average length than our it courses and accordingly a lower average revenue per participant 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
revenues in the first half of fiscal year declined by from the comparable period in fiscal year  in contrast  revenues grew by in the third quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year and  even after a adverse effect from foreign exchange rate changes  by in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a decrease of from the  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training  a increase over the  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training  a decrease from the  attendee days in fiscal year revenues in the united states increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in the number of course participants 
revenues from our international operations decreased from million in fiscal year to million fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants  which was partially offset by a positive effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
cost of revenues 
during fiscal year  we presented  events compared to  events during fiscal year our cost of revenues for fiscal years and was million 
our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 

table of contents the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year reflected a decrease in average revenue per event as well as a increase in average cost per event 
the decrease in our average revenue per event was the result of the higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations and the higher percentage of participants at our management courses discussed above 
the increase in average cost per event in fiscal year principally resulted from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the decrease in our average number of days per event held compared to fiscal year  somewhat offset by proportionately higher fixed costs per event due to having fewer events during fiscal year over which to allocate the expenses associated with our education centers 
gross profit in the united states decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to the higher percentage of participants at courses held at customer locations and at our management courses  both of which have lower average revenue per participant  and due to the proportionately higher fixed costs per event due to having fewer events during fiscal year over which to allocate the expenses associated with our education centers 
gross profit from our international operations decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in the number of course participants 
course development expenses 
during fiscal year  largely due to the decline in our revenues  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during fiscal year in fiscal year  we decreased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this net decrease reflected a reduction of million in course author expense offset by increases of million in consulting expense related to anyware and million in various other costs 
we introduced new management course titles in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year during fiscal year we introduced new it courses compared with in fiscal year based on our research and development efforts on various approaches to delivering hybrid learning  which combines instructor led classroom training with web based e learning  in fiscal year we introduced learning tree anyware  our e learning platform that allows individuals located anywhere to attend a live instructor led class being conducted in a learning tree education center or at a customer location 
at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal year reflected the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at october   we had management titles in our course library  compared with management titles at the end of fiscal year our library of it titles numbered as of october  compared to at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we reduced the number of catalogs produced and mailed  lowering our expenses by million 
reduction of personnel and benefits accounted for an additional reduction of million 
these decreases were offset by increases in sales commissions of million  recruiting expense of million  professional service fees of million for website redesign and anyware and for initial sales support for our veteran s administration contract of million 
changes in foreign exchange rates caused our overall sales and marketing expenses to increase by about 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased by million  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year additionally  fiscal years and included the following significant items not associated with current operations 
fiscal year included a charge of million for an expected period of vacancy due to the exercise of an option to terminate by one of our london education center subtenants on october  fiscal year included a charge of million to settle a contract dispute with the united states government  which was paid at million on april  fiscal year included million of restructuring costs incurred as a result of staff reductions in november and april fiscal year included million of costs associated with exploring a potential sale of the company  including non contingent transaction contribution bonuses for certain employees principally in our finance and accounting department  as well as legal fees and special committee fees 
other decreases included million in professional services fees  primarily for auditing services  million in software amortization and depreciation  primarily for our accounting software  million in rent expense  million for the reversal of an asset retirement obligation from the renegotiation of a lease  and million in personnel and benefits 
during fiscal year  changes in foreign exchange rates caused total general and administrative expenses to increase by about compared with fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year decreased by million over the prior fiscal year  from million to million 
this change was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding cash balances offset by a decrease in foreign exchange losses of million 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the lower effective rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the reduction in uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in fiscal year which resulted in a million decrease 
the higher effective rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to united states income taxes on the repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries  the write off of deferred tax assets related to equity compensation and other nondeductible items  which collectively increased tax expense by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the tax benefits from valuation allowance reversals of approximately million 
we did not provide for united states federal income and foreign withholding taxes of international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of october   because we currently intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings were approximately million as of october  if these earnings were distributed  we would incur approximately million of foreign withholding taxes 
because of the availability of united states foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested 
geographic data learning tree education centers are located in six countries and we have historically derived roughly half of our revenues from outside the united states 
the united states operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from our european 
table of contents operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year canadian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year and our asian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on segment reporting 
although our consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  all of our subsidiaries other than in the united states have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on our results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on our foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on our foreign expenses  and vice versa 
the impact of future exchange rates on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques we might implement would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
inflation inflation and changing prices do not have a significant impact on our net sales  revenues and income from continuing operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec did not  or management believes will not  have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results of operations historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
typically  our first and third fiscal quarters have higher revenues and income from operations than do our second and fourth fiscal quarters 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of and response to our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the 
table of contents timing of our introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets we serve  vii our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing and development of our courses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for our unaudited quarterly financial data for the eight fiscal quarters ended september  our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at september  included cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
during fiscal year  the total of our cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily as a result of cash provided by operations of million and net sales of available for sale securities of million partially offset by million used for capital expenditures and million used for repurchases of our common stock 
cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at september  from million at october  fiscal year ended net change october  october  september  vs 
vs 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to lower net proceeds from the disposition of available for sale securities and higher purchases of equipment and other capital assets 
cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to larger repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends during fiscal year the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year was a negative million 

table of contents in fiscal year  free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements was million 
this compares to million of free cash flow in fiscal year the improvement in free cash flow for fiscal year is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities partially offset by an increase in purchases of capital expenditures 
we believe that free cash flow is useful for investors to understand our liquidity 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and accordingly should be considered only as a supplement to  and not a replacement of  cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities computed in accordance with gaap fiscal year october  october  september  cash provided by operating activities less purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements free cash flow liquidity 
at september  our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million  a million increase from our working capital balance at october  the change in working capital was due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million offset by net sales of available for sale securities of million 
this increase in working capital was primarily due to net income as operating assets and liabilities were comparable between fiscal years and we have no outstanding debt or line of credit agreements 
we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations to finance our operating cash needs 
we believe that such funds will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements 
during fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million for the purchase of equipment worldwide  mostly computers and other equipment for use in our courses  as well as million of leasehold improvements which subsequently were reimbursed by the landlord in october we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to accommodate any increased customer demand  to continue improving the quality and effectiveness of our course delivery  and to incorporate significant changes in technology 
we have a number of operating leases for our administrative offices and education center classroom facilities located worldwide 
these leases expire at various dates over the next years 
in addition to requiring monthly payments for rent  some of the leases contain asset retirement provisions whereby we are required to return the leased facility back to a specified condition at the expiration of the lease

critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each course attendance is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses all passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s total invoiced price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
this assumed utilization rate may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass historical trends 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on our analysis of various factors  including our historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable 
although our estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
lease termination costs 
we lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used and that is currently subleased 
we calculate and record a liability related to those leases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the remaining term of the leases 
periodically  we evaluate the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and make adjustments as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  we entered into a year lease on a building in london to house our united kingdom education center 
this building has space in addition to that required for our current needs  which we attempt to sublet 
when space is vacant from time to time  we must estimate the fair value of the liability for the vacant space based upon the remaining lease costs as defined by our operating lease agreement reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the computed short and long term portions of such liabilities are recorded as deferred facilities rent and other in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts are paid under the master lease to the landlord  netted against subtenant sublease receipts  and applied to our accrued lease liability  reducing the amount of liability recorded with an offset to general and administrative expenses 
asset retirement obligations 
we record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for us  most asset retirement obligation aro liabilities are primarily associated with education facilities leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over years or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual retirement and the estimated liability previously recorded will be recognized as a gain or loss in our statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at our credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods we may also make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  our credit adjusted risk free rate that considers our estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium that we determine based 
table of contents on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each affected country 
for the more significant aros we obtain third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
we cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
see critical accounting estimates for significant policies on revenue recognition 
in addition to our learning tree training passports  we also offer a multiple course sales discount referred to as learning tree training vouchers 
with learning tree training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a six to twelve month period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
for the majority of training vouchers with unused seats at the expiration of the voucher  we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seats as revenue 
at times we make a business decision to extend the life of a training voucher beyond the normal twelve month expiration date 
training vouchers purchased under government rate schedules have no expiration date 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables including our expected stock price volatility  expected term and risk free interest rates 
we analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury rate at the date of grant  which most closely resembles the expected life of our options 
the estimated expected life represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on the simplified method under asc we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
during fiscal year  we reduced to zero the estimated forfeiture rate for executive personnel 
the forfeiture rate for fiscal years and was zero 
long lived assets 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long lived assets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc  income taxes 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to 
table of contents be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
outlook effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of our business annually is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates of december  remain constant for the remainder of our first quarter of fiscal year  we would expect to report an unfavorable effect of approximately on our revenues during our first quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year of course  we would also see a favorable effect from exchange rates on our overall expenses  though this effect is less pronounced because more of our expenses are denominated in dollars  including our corporate management and centralized it  marketing and course development activities which are located here in the united states 
first quarter revenues 
we currently expect revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  compared to revenues of million in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter gross profit 
we expect a gross profit percentage in our first quarter of fiscal year of between and compared to in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter operating expenses 
we expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million  compared to million in our first quarter last year 
first quarter income from operations 
as a result of the above factors  we expect to achieve first quarter operating income of between million and million compared with million in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter interest income 
we expect first quarter interest income to be less than million 
first quarter pre tax income 
overall  we expect to report pre tax income for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  compared with million in the first quarter of fiscal year effective tax rate 
we estimate that our effective tax rate in our first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and available for sale securities are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly affected by either a increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in canada  the united kingdom  sweden and france 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the us dollar value of their reported earnings as well as on the intercompany transactions with the united states and other subsidiaries 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher  respectively 
a hypothetical appreciation of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and swedish krona of would result in a million increase to our consolidated fiscal year results 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to the net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the us dollar amount of our stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non united states subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
due to unfavorable changes in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound and the swedish krona  the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income declined million during fiscal year additionally  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency gains or losses due to short term intercompany transactions between the united states and its consolidated subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
these balances generated a foreign exchange loss of million in fiscal year to perform a sensitivity analysis  we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
as of september   the result of a uniform change in the values of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar for intercompany exposures with all other variables held constant would be immaterial to our statement of operations 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
in the future  we may undertake such transactions  however  any hedging techniques we might implement might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available for sale securities  restricted interest bearing long term investments and 
table of contents trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies and government agencies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry  and no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues on an annual or quarterly basis during fiscal year we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to our trade receivables 
we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
