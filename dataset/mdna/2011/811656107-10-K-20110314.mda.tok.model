the discussion and analysis below includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in part i  item a of this annual report that could cause our actual results of operations  performance and business prospects and opportunities in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  those forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report 
overview we provide workers compensation insurance coverage for prescribed benefits that employers are required to provide to their employees who may be injured in the course of their employment 
we currently provide workers compensation insurance to customers in the maritime  adr and state act markets 
principal revenue and expense items we derive our revenue from premiums earned  net investment income  net realized gains and losses from investments and service fee income 
our primary expense items are loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses 
premiums earned direct premiums written include all premiums charged for policies we issue during a fiscal period 
assumed premiums are premiums that we receive from an authorized state mandated pool 
gross premiums written is the sum of direct and assumed premiums written 
net premiums written represent gross premiums written less premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers ceded premiums written 
net premiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
premiums are earned over the terms of the related policies in proportion to the risks underwritten 
our policies typically have terms of months 
thus  for example  for a policy that is written on july   approximately one half of the premiums would be earned in and the other half would be earned in at the end of each accounting period  the portion of the premiums that are not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in the subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policies 
we earn our direct premiums written from our maritime  adr and state act customers 
we also earn a small portion of our direct premiums written from employers who participate in the washington usl h plan 
we immediately cede of those premiums  net of our expenses  and of the losses in connection with that business to the plan 
net investment income and realized gains and losses on investments we invest our statutory surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in cash  cash equivalents and fixed income securities 
our investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets 
realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income 
we earn realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their amortized cost in the case of fixed maturity securities and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their carrying value 
claims service income we receive claims service income in return for providing claims administration services for other companies 
the claims service income we receive for providing these services approximates our costs 
for the years ended december    and approximately   and respectively  of our claims service income was generated by contracts we have with lmc to provide claims handling services for the policies written by the eagle entities prior to the acquisition 
we expect income from these contracts to continue to decrease substantially over the next several years as transactions related to the eagle entities diminish 
the next largest claims administration services customer represented approximately   and of claims service income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and loss adjustment expenses represent our largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
for further information regarding our loss and loss adjustment expenses  including amounts paid and unpaid  see the discussion under the heading critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense in part ii  item of this annual report 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses in our insurance subsidiary  we refer to the expenses that we incur to underwrite risks as underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses 
underwriting expenses consist of commission expenses  premium taxes and fees and other underwriting expenses incurred in writing and maintaining our business 
we pay commission expense in our insurance subsidiary to our brokers for the premiums that they produce for us 
we pay state and local taxes based on premiums  licenses and fees  assessments  and contributions to workers compensation security funds 
other underwriting expenses consist of general administrative expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  rent and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately  and boards  bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and admi nistration items such as rating manuals  rating plans and experience data 
certain of these costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts deferred acquisition costs are initially deferred and amortized over the typical policy term of months 
therefore  with respect to deferred acquisition costs  there are timing differences between when the costs are incurred or paid and when the related expense is recognized in our statements of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross premiums written 
gross premiums written consists of direct premiums written and premiums assumed from the ncci residual markets 
the number of customers we service  in force payrolls and in force premiums represent some of the factors we consider when analyzing gross premiums written 
gross premiums written totaled million in compared to million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
much of the decrease in gross premiums written resulted from premium declines primarily related to our core business  offset by business growth in our program business 
program business  which includes alternative markets and small maritime programs  increased million in compared to this increase was offset by a million decrease in our core product lines  which include everything other than our program business primarily energy  maritime and construction business 
the decrease was primarily driven by our construction business as a result of the continuing impact of the economic downturn 
we have also experienced a reduction in our renewal retention rates as a result of rate increases and other underwriting actions we ve taken in response to recent upward trends in medical and indemnity claims costs 
our overall renewal retention rate was for the fourth quarter of  compared to for third quarter and for fourth quarter excluding work we perform as the servicing carrier for the washington usl h plan and business assumed from the ncci residual market pools  the total number of customers we serviced increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  we experienced an increase of approximately customers related to our program business  which was offset by a decrease of approximately customers in our core business 
by design  our program business will have a larger number of customers with a smaller average premium size than our core book of business 
as of december   the average premium size in our program business was approximately  compared to approximately  in our core business 
these num bers were virtually unchanged from average premium sizes at december  total in force payrolls  one of the factors used to determine premium charges  decreased from billion at december  to billion at year end california continues to be our largest market  accounting for approximately million  or of our in force premiums at december  this represents an increase of million  or  from approximately million  or  of in force premiums in california at december  the following is a summary of our top five markets based on direct premiums written excluding premiums written under the washington usl h plan year ended december  direct premiums written direct premiums written in thousands california louisiana alaska texas pennsylvania total premiums assumed from the ncci residual markets in the twelve months ended december  totaled million compared to million for the same period in  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our policy year estimates recorded in we experienced significant reductions in our california premium rates from to over that period  we filed  and the california department of insurance approved  eight rate reductions resulting in a net cumulative reduction of our california rates of approximately 
beginning in  we filed  and the california department of insurance approved  the following increases in our california rates increase effective january   increase effective august   and increase effective september  these rate increases were filed following the completion of internal studies of our california loss costs and were primarily in response to increased projected medical costs and recent decisions by the workers compensation appeals board 
if other insurers do not adopt similar rate i ncreases  these rate increases may have a negative effect on our ability to compete in california 
rate changes have also been adopted in other states in which we operate 
for additional information regarding recent rate change activity in california and other states  see the discussion under the heading regulation federal and state legislative and regulatory changes in part i  item of this annual report 
net premiums written 
net premiums written totaled million in compared to million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross written premiums  offset in part by a million decrease in premiums ceded primarily resulting from residual market business 
premiums ceded were also impacted by our new excess of loss reinsurance program that became effective on october  gross premiums written assumed from the ncci residual market pools in decreased approximately million from the prior year amount  resulting in a similar reduction in ceded premiums since the business assumed from the ncci for policy years and is ceded to independent reinsurers 
this reduction in ceded premiums was offset by a higher ceding rate in our excess of loss reinsurance program that renewed in october our ceding rate increased by approximately as a result of lowering the attachment point from million to million and increasing maximum coverage from million to million 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
we record the entire annual policy premium as unearned premium at inception and earn the premium over the life of the policy  which is generally twelve months  in proportion to the underlying exposure 
consequently  the amount of premiums earned in any given year depends on when the underlying policies were written and how the underlying payroll exposure is reported 
our direct premiums earned increased million  or  to million in from million in net premiums earned in were reduced by net adjustments of approximately milli on on retrospectively rated policies due to favorable loss results on those policies 
net premiums earned are also affected by premiums ceded under reinsurance treaties 
ceded earned premiums in totaled million compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or net investment income 
net investment income was million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
average invested assets increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase in our investment portfolio is due primarily to cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december   which was invested primarily in fixed income securities 
net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets decreased slightly to in from in primarily due to reduced reinvestment interest rates 
claims and other service income 
claims and other service income totaled million in and million in our service income resulted primarily from service arrangements we have with customers for claims processing services and policy administration services that we perform for them 
other than temporary impairment losses 
we had no other than temporary impairment otti losses for the year ended december   compared to million in  which related to our investment in government sponsored agency preferred stock 
the charge followed a million otti charge related to the same securities in and was recorded at the time management made the decision to liquidate the impaired securities 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  representing a decrease of million  or 
other income is derived primarily from the operations of pointsure  our wholesale broker and third party administrator  and pmcs  our provider of medical bill review  utilization review  nurse care management and related services 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
our net loss ratio  which is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses less claims service income by premiums earned  was in compared to in the increase in our net loss ratio was primarily attributable to unfavorable development of prior accident year loss reserves of million in offset by a million favorable commutation gain  compared to unfavorable development of prior year accident year loss reserves of million in offset by a million favorable commutation gain 
the increase in o ur net loss ratio was also impacted by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio from at december  to at december  and an increase of approximately million in the earned premium against which the current accident year expected loss ratio elr is applied 
our direct loss reserves are net of reinsurance and exclude reserves associated with keic  whom we acquired from lmc in september  and the business that we involuntarily assume from the ncci 
for accident year  an expected loss ratio was established for each jurisdiction and type of loss indemnity  medical and allocated loss and loss adjustment expenses alae 
the expected loss ratio was multiplied by the booked accident year earned premium to produce the ultimate loss to date 
the expected loss ratio selections are reviewed quarterly with each internal ibnr study 
given the short experience period for the current accident year  the expected loss ratios are usually maintained at least through the first months of the accident year and revised as the underlying data matures 
however  we increased the expected loss ratio for from to in the second quarter of after reviewing results for the accident year and considering the adverse development of accident years and for accident year  the ultimate loss estimates at december  were higher when compared to december  and resulted in a net increase of our loss reserves of million 
the increase was attributable to the following jurisdictions million for california state act  driven primarily by medical costs  million for non california state act  driven by increased medical and indemnity costs  and million for usl h  driven primarily by increased indemnity costs 
this adverse development was offset by favorable development of million related to ulae  loss based assessments and ncci 
for accident year  the ultimate loss estimates at december  were higher when compared to december  and resulted in a net increase of our loss reserves of million 
the increase was attributable to the following jurisdictions million for california state act  driven primarily by medical costs  million for non california state act  driven primarily by medical costs  and million for usl h  driven primarily by increased indemnity and alae costs 
this adverse development was offset by favorable development of million related to ulae  loss based assessments and ncci  as well as million related to favorable commutation 
for accident year  the ultimate loss estimates at december  were higher when compared to december  and resulted in a net increase of our loss reserves of million 
the increase was attributable to the following jurisdictions million for california state act  driven primarily by medical costs  million for non california state act  driven primarily by indemnity and alae costs  and million for usl h  driven primarily by increased indemnity and alae costs 
this adverse development was offset by favorable development of million related to ulae  loss based assessments and ncci  as well as million related to favorable commutation 
for accident years and prior  the ultimate loss estimates at december  were higher when compared to december  and resulted in a net increase of our loss reserves of million 
our ability to adequately provide funds to pay claims comes from our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards and the purchase of reinsurance to protect us against severe claims and catastrophic events 
effective october   we entered into reinsurance agreements with nonaffiliated reinsurers wherein we retain the first million of each loss occurrence and the next million of losses per occurrence are reinsured  subject to an aggregate deductible of million 
the next million of losses per occurrence from million to million per loss occurrence are reinsured 
losses in excess of million per loss occurrence are fully reinsured through the program limit of million per loss occurrence  subject to various deductibles and exclusions 
the new reinsurance program is effective through september  our reinsurance program that was effective october  to september  provided us with reinsurance protection for each loss occurrence in excess of million  up to million  subject to various deductibles and exclusions 
given industry and predecessor trends  we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to cover our retained losses 
we have recently observed an increase in severity estimates for accident years through in california following several years of decreasing trends 
we have established loss reserves at december  that are based upon our current best estimate of ultimate loss costs  taking into consideration the recent paid loss claim data  incurred loss trends and uncertainty regarding the permanence of recent legislative reforms 
we continue to monitor the impact of reforms and potential challenges to reforms in our loss data 
see the discussion under the headings loss reserves in part i  item and critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense in this item for a further discussion of our loss reserving proces s 
provisions in the three lower layer treaties covering losses from million to million in our reinsurance program allow us the ability  at our sole discretion  to commute the contracts within months of expiration in return for a contingent profit commission calculated in accordance with terms specified in the contracts 
in accordance with these provisions  we commuted the million excess million layer of this treaty in in return for a contingent profit commission of approximately million 
the two lower layers from million to million were not commuted 
as of december   there were no ceded losses associated with the million excess million layer and it is not expected that developed losses that would otherwise be covered by reinsurance will exceed the contingent profit commission 
the contingent profit commission was recorded as a reduction of loss and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   we had recorded a receivable of approximately million for adverse loss development under the adverse development cover since the date of the acquisition 
we do not expect this receivable to have any material effect on our future cash flows if lmc fails to perform its obligations under the adverse development cover 
at december   we had access to approximately million under the collateralized reinsurance trust in the event that lmc fails to satisfy its obligations under the adverse development cover

underwriting expenses totaled million in compared to million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
our net underwriting expense ratio  which is calculated by dividing underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses less other service income by premiums earned  was in compared to in the decline in our expense ratio resulted from decreases in our underwriting expenses and increases in our net premiums earned from the same period of interest expense 
interest expense related to the surplus notes issued by our insurance subsidiary in may totaled million in and million in the surplus notes interest rate  which is calculated at the beginning of each interest payment period using the month libor plus basis points  ranged between and in down from and in other expenses 
other expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in other expenses result primarily from the operations of pointsure and pmcs 
the decrease in other expenses was largely attributable to reduced personnel costs and direct costs 
income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  resulted in a benefit of compared to an expense of for the same period in the effective tax rate for differed from the statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of tax exempt interest income  which accounted for approximately percentage points of the increase to the statutory rate 
the increase in the benefit was partially offset by approximately million  or percentage points  due to a true up of vesting expense related to restricted stock which vested during the year 
the effective rate for december  was lower than the statutory rate of primarily as a result of tax exe mpt interest income  which accounted for approximately percentage points of the reduction from the statutory rate 
this decrease in the statutory rate was partially offset by approximately million  or percentage points  due to state income taxes and other nondeductible expenses

net premiums written totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross written premiums  offset in part by a million increase in premiums ceded related to the increased ceding rate of the reinsurance contracts due primarily to an increase in limits at the lower and upper ends of the program  as well as the addition of a new reinsurance treaty related to the residual market business 
included in gross premiums written in is a decrease in the amount of premiums we involuntarily assume on residual market business from the ncci  which operates residual market programs on behalf of many states

the million otti charge in also related to our investment in government sponsored agency preferred stock 
the otti charges were the result of thorough reviews of the investment portfolio and a determination by management that these investments met the criteria for otti ch arges primarily due to the extent and duration of the impairments and the inability to forecast a complete recovery of their book values within a reasonable period of time or  in the case of the government sponsored entity preferred stocks  a significant decline in the underlying credit fundamentals of the securities

this small movement resulted from the recognition of the results from the standard actuarial methodologies in our december  ibnr study 
this adverse development was offset by favorable development of million related to ulae  million related to loss based assessments and ncci and a favorable commutation gain of million 
due to the longer tail nature of workers compensation  small movement in an accident year s ultimate loss estimate can be reasonably expected 
there is uncertainty about whether the positive effects of california legislative reforms enacted in and will be sustained  particularly in light of current efforts to change or repeal portions of the reforms 
we will not know the full impact of these reforms with a high degree of confidence for several years 
we observed an increase in severity estimates for accident years and in california following several years of decreasing trends

given industry a nd predecessor trends  we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to cover our retained losses 
our insurance subsidiary is required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the naic has a risk based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
as of december   the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiary was in excess of the prescribed risk based capital requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action

the increase in was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums collected of approximately million and a decrease in federal income taxes paid of approximately million  offset by an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses paid net of reinsur ance collected of approximately million 
we expect to experience a reduction in operating cash flows as a result of increased claim payments and higher premiums under the excess of loss reinsurance treaty program renewed on october   among other factors 
we used net cash of million for investing activities in compared to million in and million in the decrease in from was driven by lower net investment purchase activity purchases  net of sales and maturities 
the increase in from was driven by higher net investment purchase activity purchases  net of sales and maturities partially offset by a reduction in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  an increase of million from million in  which decreased million from million of net cash provided in the increase in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of quarterly cash dividends paid in contractual obligations and commitments the following table identifies our contractual obligations by payment due period as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations surplus notes loss and loss adjustment expenses operating lease obligations total the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policies we write 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense process  see the heading loss reserves in part i  item of this annual report and critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense in part ii  item of this annual report 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see the discussion under the heading risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses in part i  item a of this annual report for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be critical to the presentation of our financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently  actual results reflected in future periods might differ from these estimates 
the most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  the amount and recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances  deferred policy acquisition costs  income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  earned but unbilled premiums and retrospective premiums 
the following should be read in conjunction with the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense represents our estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on known facts and circumstances 
our policy is to record the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense equal to the point estimate we determine 
included in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense are amounts for case based reserves  including estimates of future developments on those claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported to us  second injury fund expenses  and allocated and unallocated claim adjustment expenses 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the cost of unsettled and unreported claims  the ultimate liability may differ  perhaps materially  from the original estimate 
these estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any res ulting adjustments are included in the current period s operating results 
following is a summary of the gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business as of december  and the workers compensation line of business comprises over of our total loss reserves as of both dates 
as of december  as of december  line of business case ibnr total case ibnr total in thousands workers compensation ocean marine general liability total actuarial loss reserve estimation methods we use a variety of actuarial methodologies to assist us in establishing the reserve for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense 
we also make judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to achieve ultimate resolution  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors that are often beyond our control 
for the current accident year  we establish the initial reserve for claims incurred but not reported ibnr using an expected loss ratio elr method 
the elr method is based on an analysis of historical loss ratios adjusted for current pricing levels  exposure growth  anticipated trends in claim frequency and severity  the impact of reform activity and any other factors that may have an impact on the loss ratio 
the actual paid and incurred loss data for the accident year is reviewed each quarter and changes to the elr may be made based on the emerging data  although changes are typically not made until the end of the accident year when the loss data can be analyzed as a complete accident year 
however  due to results experienced for the accident year and the adverse development of acc ident years and  we increased our elr from to at june  the elr is multiplied by the year to date earned premium to determine the ultimate losses for the current accident year 
the actual paid and case outstanding losses are subtracted from the ultimate losses to determine the ibnr for the accident year 
as the accident year matures  we incorporate a standard actuarial reserving methodology referred to as the bornhuetter ferguson method 
this method blends the loss development and expected loss ratio methods by assigning partial weight to the initial expected losses  calculated from the expected loss ratio method  with the remaining weight applied to the actual losses  either paid or incurred 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
a reserve estimate implies a pattern of expected loss emergence 
if this emergence does not occur as expected  it may cause us to revisit our previous assumptions 
we may adjust loss development patterns  the various method weights or the expected loss ratios used in our analysis 
management employs judgment in each reserve valuation as to how to make these adjustments to reflect current information 
for all other accident years  the estimated ultimate losses are developed using a variety of actuarial techniques as described below 
in reviewing this information  we consider the following factors to be especially important at this time because they increase the variability risk factors in our loss reserve estimates we wrote our first policy on october  and  as a result  our total reserve portfolio is relatively immature when compared to other industry data 
we have grown significantly since we began operations and have entered into several new states that are not included in our predecessor s historical data 
at december   approximately million  or  of our direct loss reserves were related to business written in california 
over the last several years  four significant comprehensive legislative reforms were enacted in california ab was enacted in february  ab and sb were enacted in september  and sb was enacted in april this reform activity has resulted in uncertainty regarding the impact of the reforms on loss payments  loss development and  ultimately  loss reserves  making historical data less reliable as an indicator of future loss 
all four bills enacted structural changes to the benefit delivery system in california  in addition to changes in the indemnity and medical benefits afforded injured workers 
in response to the reform legislation and a continuing drop in the frequency of workers compensation claims  the pure premium rates approved by the california insurance commissioner effective january  were lower than the pure premium rates in effect as of july  more recent data has indicated the need for an increase in rates in california 
with the california department of insurance s approval  we adopted a increase in advisory pure premium rates effective january  in june  we filed for a rate increase to be effective august   which was approved by the california insurance department 
in july  we filed for a average rate increase with the california department of insurance  which was approved in august and became effective on september  key elements of the reforms as they relate to indemnity and medical benefits were as follows indemnity benefits ab significantly increased most classes of workers compensation indemnity benefits over a four year period beginning in ab and sb repealed the mandatory vocational rehabilitation benefits and replaced them with a system of non transferable education vouchers 
sb required the division of workers compensation dwc administrative director to adopt  on or before january   a new permanent disability rating schedule pdrs based in part on american medical association guidelines 
also  temporary disability was limited to a duration of two years 
sb also provided that  effective april   apportionment of disability for purposes of permanent disability determination must be based on causation 
medical benefits ab repealed the presumption given to the primary treating physician except when the worker has pre designated a personal physician  effective for injuries occurring on or after january  sb and sb later extended this to all future medical treatment on earlier injuries 
sb required the dwc administrative director to establish  by december   an official medical treatment utilization schedule meeting specific criteria 
sb also provided that beginning three months after the publication date of the updated american college of occupational and environmental medical acoem practice guidelines and continuing until such time as the dwc administrative director establishes an official medical treatment utilization schedule  the acoem standards will be presumed to be correct regarding the extent and scope of all medical treatment 
the dwc administrative director has subsequently adopted the acoem guidelines as the official medical treatment utilization schedule 
sb limited the number of chiropractic visits and the number of physical therapy visits to each per claim 
sb established a prescription medication fee schedule set at of medi cal schedule amounts 
sb provided that the maximum facility fee for services performed in an ambulatory surgical center may not exceed of the medicare fees for the same service performed in a hospital outpatient facility 
sb provided that after january   an employer or insurer may establish medical provider networks meeting certain conditions and  with limited exceptions  medical treatment can be provided within those networks 
these reforms are a source of variability in the reserve estimates as legislative changes affecting benefit levels not only impact the cost of benefits but also the rate at which accident year benefits or losses develop over time 
ongoing efforts by some system stakeholders to challenge the reforms  either through legislative  administrative or judicial means  further adds to the variability 
in the last three years there have been ongoing challenges to the pdrs  one of the most significant reforms to emerge from the legislation 
the pdrs was revised effective january  the revised schedule has resulted in significantly reduced permanent disability awards  leading to concerns that injured workers may not be adequately compensated for their work related permanent injuries 
in february of  the california workers compensation appeals board the appeals board rendered an en banc decision on a series of cases  commonly referred to as almarez  guzman and ogilvie 
allowing a rebuttal of the ama guides  the decision has a material impact on the value of permanent disability awards 
the en banc decision led to considerable comment and debate in the workers compensation community 
in september of  the appeals board reaffirmed most aspects of its prior work  with some clarifications to its february decisions 
its decision is considered final with details to be determined by case law and through appeal 
in november of  the california supreme court declined to review the guzman case 
an appeal of the almarez case to the fifth circuit court of appeals is p ending 
workers compensation is considered a long tail line of business  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
management believes that it generally takes workers compensation losses approximately to months after the start of an accident year until the data is viewed as fully credible for paid and incurred reserve evaluation methods 
workers compensation losses can continue to develop beyond months and in some cases claims can remain open more than years 
as indicated above  we wrote our first policy on october  so our first complete accident year is as of december   accident year was months developed  accident year was months developed  accident year was mo nths developed  accident year was months developed  accident year was months developed  accident year was months developed  and accident year was months developed 
our loss reserve estimates are subject to considerable variation due to the relative immaturity of the accident years from a development standpoint 
we review the following significant components of loss reserves on a quarterly basis ibnr reserves for losses this includes amounts for the medical and indemnity components of the workers compensation claim payments  net of subrogation recoveries and deductibles  ibnr reserves for defense and cost containment expenses dcc  also referred to as allocated loss adjustment expenses alae  net of subrogation recoveries and deductibles  reserve for adjusting and other expenses  also known as unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae  and reserve for loss based assessments  also referred to as the f reserve in reference to section  compensation for disability  subsection f  injury increasing disability  of the united states longshore and harbor workers compensation act usl h act 
the reserves for losses and dcc are also reviewed gross and net of reinsurance referred to as net 
for gross losses  the claims for the washington usl h plan  the keic claims assumed in the acquisition and claims assumed from the ncci residual market pools are excluded from this discussion 
ibnr reserves include a provision for future development on known claims  a reopened claims reserve  a provision for claims incurred but not reported and a provision for claims in transit incurred and reported but not recorded 
our analysis is done separately for the indemnity  medical and dcc components of the total loss reserves within each accident year 
in addition  the analysis is completed separately for the following five categories state act  california california  state act  alaska and hawaii alaska hawaii  state act  illinois illinois  state act  all other states all other  and usl h claims 
the business is divided into these categories for the determination of ultimate losses due to differences in the laws that cover each of these categories 
workers compensation insurance is statutorily provided for in all of the states in which we do business 
state laws and regulations provide for the form and content of policy coverage and the rights and benefits that are available to injured workers  their representatives and medical providers 
because the benefits are established by state statute  there can be significant variation in these benefits by state 
we refer to this coverage as state act 
our business is also affected by federal laws including the usl h act  which is administered by the department of labor  and the merchant marine act of  or jones act 
the usl h act contains various provisions affecting our business  including the nature of the liability of employers of longshoremen  the rate of compensation to an injured longshoreman  the selection of physicians  compensation for disability and death and the filing of claims 
we refer to the business covered under the usl h act and the jones act as usl h 
because there are different laws and benefit levels that affect the state act versus usl h business  there is a strong likelihood that these categories will exhibit different loss development characteristics which will influence the ultimate loss calculations 
separating the data into the state act and usl h categories allows us to use actuarial methods that contemplate these differences 
development factors  expected loss rates and expected loss ratios are derived from the combined experience of us and our predecessor 
gross ultimate loss indemnity  medical and alae separately for each category is estimated using the following actuarial methods paid loss or alae development  incurred loss or alae development  bornhuetter ferguson using ultimate premiums and paid loss or alae  and bornhuetter ferguson using ultimate premiums and incurred loss or alae 
a gross ultimate value is selected by reviewing the various ultimate estimates and applying actuarial judgment to achieve a reasonable point estimate of the ultimate liability 
the gross ibnr reserve equals the selected gross ultimate loss minus the gross paid losses and gross case reserves as of the valuation date 
the selected gross ultimate loss and alae are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
variation in ultimate loss estimates in light of our short operating history and uncertainties concerning the effects of recent legislative reforms  specifically as they relate to our california workers compensation experience  the actuarial techniques discussed above use the historical experience of our predecessor as well as industry information in the analysis of loss reserves 
we are able to effectively draw on the historical experience of our predecessor because most of the current members of our management and adjusting staff also served as the management and adjusting staff of our predecessor 
over time  we expect to place more reliance on our own developed loss experience and less on our predecessor s and industry experience 
these techniques recognize  among other factors our claims experience and that of our predecessor  the industry s claim experience  historical trends in reserving patterns and loss payments  the impact of claim inflation and or deflation  the pending level of unpaid claims  the cost of claim settlements  legislative reforms affecting workers compensation  including pricing  the overall environment in which insurance companies operate  and trends in claim frequency and severity 
in addition  there are loss and loss adjustment expense risk factors that affect workers compensation claims that can change over time and also cause our loss reserves to fluctuate 
some examples of these risk factors include  but are not limited to  the following availability of light duty for early return to work  recovery time from the injury  increased claim duration and its effect on treatment utilization and costs  changes in state or federal compensation benefit law  changes in case law affecting compensation guidelines  degree of patient responsiveness to treatment  use of pharmaceutical drugs  type and effectiveness of medical treatments  frequency of visits to healthcare providers  changes in costs of medical treatments  availability of new medical treatments and equipment  types of healthcare providers used  attorney involvement  wage inflation in states that index benefits  and changes in administrative policies of second injury funds 
variation can also occur in the loss reserves due to factors that affect our book of business in general 
some examples of these risk factors include  but are not limited to  the following injury type mix  change in mix of business by state  change in mix of business by employer type  small volume of internal data  and significant exposure growth over recent data periods 
impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility the most significant factor currently impacting our loss reserve estimates is the reliance on historical reserving patterns and loss payments from our predecessor and the industry  also referred to as loss development 
this is due to our limited operating history as discussed above 
the actuarial methods that we use depend at varying levels on loss development patterns based on past information 
development is defined as the difference  on successive valuation dates  between observed values of certain fundamental quantities that may be used in the loss reserve estimation process 
for example  the data may be paid losses  case incurred losses and the change in case reserves or claim counts  including reported claims  closed claims or reopened claims 
development can be expected  meaning it is consistent with prior resul ts  favorable better than expected  or unfavorable worse than expected 
in all cases  we are comparing the actual development of the data in the current valuation with what was expected based on the historical patterns in the underlying data 
favorable development indicates a basis for reducing the estimated ultimate loss amounts while unfavorable development indicates a basis for increasing the estimated ultimate loss amounts 
we reflect the favorable or unfavorable development in loss reserves in the results of operations in the period in which the ultimate loss estimates are changed 
estimating loss reserves is an uncertain and complex process which involves actuarial techniques and management judgment 
actuarial analysis generally assumes that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves and that the data provides a basis for estimating future loss reserves 
however  since conditions and trends that have affected losses in the past may not occur in the future in the same manner  if at all  future results may not be reliably predicted by the prior data 
due to the relative immaturity of our book of business  the challenge has been to give the appropriate weight in the ultimate loss estimation process to the new data as it becomes available 
as discussed above  management believes that it generally takes workers compensation losses approximately to months after the start of an accident year until the data is viewed as fully credible for paid and incurred reserve evaluation methods 
due to our limited operating history  we have seven complete accident years that were developed month  months  months  months  months  months and months      and  respectively at december  at december   the analysis for accident years through utilizes a bornhuetter ferguson approach  which blends the loss development and expected loss ratio methods  in addition to the paid and incurred loss development methods 
for accident years through  the actuarial analysis showed varying degrees of net unfavorable movement when compared to the prior actuarial estimates at december  for accident years and prior  there was unfavorable development in the losses for california state act which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for non california state act  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident years and prior which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for usl h  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident years and prior which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for accident year  there was unfavorable development in the losses for california state act which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for non california state act  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for usl h  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for california state act and usl h  we placed more reliance on the most recent data points in our loss development selections than in the prior year 
we believe that our loss development factor selections are appropriate given the maturity level of our data 
over time  as the data for these acci dent years mature and uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of the claim costs diminish  the full impact of the actual loss development will be factored into our assumptions and selections 
for accident year  there was unfavorable development in the losses for california state act which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for non california state act  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for usl h  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for accident year  there was unfavorable development in the losses for california state act which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for non california state act  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for usl h  there was unfavorable development in the losses for accident year which resulted in an increase of our net ultimate loss estimates of million 
for accident year  the ultimate losses were set by multiplying the selected elr to the booking earned premium 
given the results from the accident year and the adverse development of prior accident years  we increased the elr for from to in the second quarter of for more information on the elr method and selection see the related discussion under the heading actuarial loss reserve estimation methods in this item reserve sensitivities although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and the corresponding unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors that are known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly 
this is the case for the impact of economic inflation on claim costs  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on historical experience or industry information to estimate values for the variables that are explicitly used in the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense analysis 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of future effects of these factors 
it is important to note that actual claims costs will vary from our estimate of ultimate claim costs  perhaps by substantial amounts  due to the inherent variability of the business written  the potentially significant claim settlement lags and the fact that not all events affecting future claim costs can be estimated 
as discussed in the previous section  there are a number of variables that can impact  individually or in combination  the adequacy of our loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
while the actuarial methods employed factor in amounts for these circumstances  the loss reserves may prove to be inadequate despite the actuarial methods used 
several examples are provided below to highlight the potential variability present in our loss reserves 
each of these examples represents scenarios that are reasonably likely to occur over time 
for example  there may be a number of claims where the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense associated with future medical treatment proves to be inadequate because the injured workers do not respond to medical treatment as expected by the claims examiner 
if we assume this affects of the open claims and  on average  the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses on these claims are inadequate  this would result in our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability being inadequate by approximately million  or  as of december  another example is claim inflation 
claim inflation can result from medical cost inflation or wage inflation 
as discussed above  the actuarial methods employed include an amount for claim inflation based on historical experience 
we assume that the historical effect of this factor  which is embedded in our experience and industry experience  is representative of future effects for claim inflation 
to the extent that the historical factors  and the actuarial methods utilized  are inadequate to recognize future inflationary trends  our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities may be inadequate 
if our estimate of future medical trend is two percentage points inadequate eg  if we estimate a annual trend and the actual trend is  our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability could be inadequate 
the amount of the inadequacy would depend on the mix of medical and indemnity payments and the length of time until the claims are paid 
for example  if we assume that of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense is associated with medical payments and an average payout period of years  our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities would be inadequate by approximately million on a pre tax basis  or  as of december  under these assumptions  the inadequacy of approximately million represents approximately of total stockholders equity at december  the impact of any reserve deficiencies  or redundancies  on our reported results and future earnings is discussed below 
in the event that our estimates of ultimate unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities prove to be greater or less than the ultimate liability  our future earnings and financial position could be positively or negatively impacted 
future earnings would be reduced by the amount of any deficiencies in the year s in which the claims are paid or the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are increased 
for example  if we determined our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability of million as of december  to be inadequate  we would experience a pre tax reduction in future earnings of approximately million 
this reduction could be realized in one year or multiple years  depending on when the deficiency is identified 
the deficiency would also impact our fin ancial position because our statutory surplus would be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in net income 
any deficiency is typically recognized in the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability and  accordingly  it typically does not have a material effect on our liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
since the claims will typically be paid out over a multi year period  we have generally been able to adjust our investments to match the anticipated future claim payments 
conversely  if our estimates of ultimate unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities prove to be redundant  our future earnings and financial position would be improved 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses represent the portion of the loss and loss adjustment expenses that is assumed by reinsurers 
these recoverables are reported on our balance sheet separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders and ceding companies 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based in part on the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts  which could be subject to interpretations that differ from ours based on judicial theories of liability 
we calculate amounts recoverable from reinsurers based on our estimates of the underlying loss and loss adjustment expenses  which themselves are subject to significant judgmen ts and uncertainties described above under the heading unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense 
changes in the estimates and assumptions underlying the calculation of our loss reserves may have an impact on the balance of our reinsurance recoverables 
in general  one would expect an increase in our underlying loss reserves on claims subject to reinsurance to have an upward impact on our reinsurance recoverables 
the amount of the impact on reinsurance recoverables would depend on a number of considerations including  but not limited to  the terms and attachment points of our reinsurance contracts and the incurred amount on various claims subject to reinsurance 
we also bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some claims may remain open for an extended period of time 
we periodically evaluate our reinsurance recoverables  including the financial ratings of our reinsurers  and revise our estimates of such amounts as conditions and circumstances change 
changes in reinsurance recoverables are recorded in the period in which the estimate is revised 
we assessed the collectability of our year end receivables and believe that all amounts are collectible based on currently available information 
therefore  as of december  and  we had no reserve for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
as of december   the top ten companies  representing of our reinsurance amounts recoverable  had am best ratings of a or higher 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer commissions  premium taxes and certain other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to the recognition of premiums earned 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of these deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related estimated investment income  anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs we expect to incur as the premium is earned 
judgments regarding the ultimate recoverability of these deferred costs are highly dependent upon the estimated future costs associated with our unearned premiums 
if our expected claims and expenses  after considering investment income  e xceed our unearned premiums  we would be required to write off all or a portion of deferred policy acquisition costs 
since inception  we have not needed to write off any portion of our deferred acquisition costs 
if our estimate of anticipated losses and related costs was inadequate  our deferred acquisition costs as of december  would still be fully recoverable and no write off would be necessary 
we will continue to monitor the balance of deferred acquisition costs for recoverability 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
this analysis requires management to make various estimates and assumptions  including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the consideration of operating versus capital items  projected future taxable income and the effect of tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from management s estimates and assumptions  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than n ot to be realized 
the establishment of a valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which it is deemed necessary 
as of december   no valuation allowance was recorded 
we established a valuation allowance of approximately million at december  of which  was recorded in tax expense and million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reversed the million allowance through accumulated other comprehensive income in fasb asc topic  income taxes  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recorded benefits and their classification  as well as the proper recording of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
as of december  and december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next months 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on unrecognize d tax benefits as an element of income tax expense benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns 
the tax years which remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities are the years ended december    and impairment of investment securities we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process  including but not limited to the following whether we intend to sell the security  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost  objective information supporting recovery in a reasonable period of time  the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  specific credit issues related to the issuer  and current economic conditions  including interest rates 
for debt securities that are considered otti and that we do not intend to sell and more likely than not would not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize otti losses in accordance with the provisions of the asc 
the amount of the otti loss is separated into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between a security s amortized cost basis and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security s effective interest rate 
the amount due to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for declines in value 
in general  we review all securities that are impaired by or more at the end of the period 
we focus our review of securities with no stated maturity date on securities that were impaired by or more at the end of the period or have been impaired or more continuously for six months or longer as of the end of the period 
we also analyze the entire portfolio for other factors that might indicate a risk of impairment  including credit ratings and interest rates 
it is possible that we could recognize future impairment losses on some securities we owned at december  if future events  information and the passage of time result in a determination that a decline in value is other than temporary 
in  no other than temporary declines in the fair value of our securities were recorded 
in  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million related to our investments in preferred stocks issued by fannie mae and freddie mac that were sold in in  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of approximately million on our investments in preferred stocks nearly all of which were government sponsored agency fixed and variable preferred stocks and approximately million on our investment in equity indexed securities exchange traded funds 
please refer to the tables in note  investments of the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report for additional information on unrealized losses o n our  investment securities 
please refer to part ii  item a of this annual report for tables showing the sensitivity of the fair value of our fixed income investments to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item of this annual report for a discussion of the limited exposure in our investment portfolio at december  to sub prime mortgages 
earned but unbilled premiums shortly following the expiration of an insurance policy  we perform a final payroll audit of each insured to determine the final premium to be billed and earned 
these final audits generally result in an audit adjustment  either increasing or decreasing the estimated premium earned and billed to date 
we estimate the amount of premiums that have been earned but are unbilled at the end of a reporting period by analyzing historical earned premium adjustments made at final audit for the preceding months and applying the average adjustment percentage against our in force earned premium for the period 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls due to growth  economic conditions  seasonality and other factors  as well as fluctuations in our in force premium 
for example  the amount of ou r accrual for premiums earned but unbilled fluctuated between  and  in and between  and  in the balance of our accrual for premiums earned but unbilled totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes that the accrual for earned but unbilled premiums is reasonable 
the estimates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations 
retrospective premiums the premiums for our retrospectively rated loss sensitive plans are reflective of the customer s loss experience because  beginning six months after the expiration of the relevant insurance policy  and annually thereafter  we recalculate the premium payable during the policy term based on the current value of the known losses that occurred during the policy term 
while the typical retrospectively rated policy has around five annual adjustment or measurement periods  premium adjustments continue until mutual agreement to cease future adjustments is reached with the policyholder 
retrospective premiums for primary and reinsured risks are included in income as earned on a pro rata basis over the effective period of the respective policies 
earned premiums on retrospectively rated policies are based on our estimate o f loss experience as of the measurement date 
unearned premiums are deferred and include that portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired period of the policies in force and estimated adjustments of premiums on policies that have retrospective rating endorsements 
we bear credit risk with respect to retrospectively rated policies 
because of the long duration of our loss sensitive plans  there is a risk that the customer will fail to pay the additional premium 
accordingly  we obtain collateral in the form of letters of credit or deposits to mitigate credit risk associated with our loss sensitive plans 
if we are unable to collect future retrospective premium adjustments from an insured  we would be required to write off the related amounts  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
since inception  there have been approximately million in write offs 
retrospectively rated policies accounted for approximately of direct premiums written in and approximately of direct premiums written in recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  to require additional disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and and certain information regarding activity in level of the fair value hierarchy 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level disclosure  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted all provisions of this standard effective january   which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  to address potential practice issues associated with asc topic  subsequent events 
the provisions of asu are effective for reporting periods ending after june  we adopted asu as of june   which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  to expand existing disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as are defined in asc topic  receivables 
the provisions of asu are effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu  accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
this asu allows insurance entities to defer costs related to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts that are incremental direct costs of the contract transaction ie  would not have occurred without the contract transaction  a portion of the employee compensation and fringe benefits related to certain activities for successful contract acquisitions  or direct response advertising costs as defined in asc subtopic  other assets and deferred costs capitalized advertising costs 
all other costs related to the acquisition of new or renewal insuranc e contracts are required to be expensed as incurred 
this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  with either prospective or retrospective application permitted 
we have not determined the impact that adoption of this new standard will have on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
however  since the new standard represents a significant departure from current practice  its adoption may result in a significant reduction in the amount of acquisition costs eligible for deferral 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in and  a series of crises occurred in the us financial and capital markets  as well as in housing and global credit markets 
these conditions accelerated into a global economic recession 
the declining economic conditions worsened over the last half of and continued into the first half of however  the equity and debt markets began to show improvement in mid going forward 
for example  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio increased from million at march  to million at december   million at september   and decreased to million at december  our consolidated balance sheets include a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks  including credit and interest rate risks 
market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
in and  we recognized  on a pre tax basis  approximately million of other than temporary impairment charges related to our investments in government sponsored entity preferred stock and exchange traded funds 
in  we recognized no other than temporary impairments 
the impact of actions taken by governmental bodies in response to the current economic conditions is difficult to predict  particularly over the short term  and we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of a recovery 
the fai r value of our investment portfolio remains subject to considerable volatility  particularly over the short term 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities 
credit risk credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
we address this risk by investing generally in fixed income securities which are rated a or higher by standard poor s or another major rating agency 
we also independently  and through our outside investment managers  monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed income securities in our portfolio 
to limit our exposure to risk  we employ stringent diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
see investments in part i  item of this annual report for a discussion of the limited exposure in our investment portfolio at december  to sub prime mortgages 
interest rate risk we had fixed income investments with a fair value of million at december  that are subject to interest rate risk compared with million at december  we manage the exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of the liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk in our investment portfolio as of december  and december  it illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of fixed income investments to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  and december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio and stockholders equity
