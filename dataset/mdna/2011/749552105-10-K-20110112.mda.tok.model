item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves and contingencies on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
one of the accounting policies that involves significant judgments and estimates concerns our inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the weighted average cost value 
certain items in the inventory may be considered obsolete or excess and  as such  we establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value 
based on estimates  assumptions and judgments made from the information available at the time  we determine the amounts of these allowances 
because inventories have  during the past few years  represented up to one third of our total assets  any reduction in the value of our inventories would require us to take write offs that would affect our net worth and future earnings 
another accounting policy that involves significant judgments and estimates is our accounts receivable allowance valuation 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that management believes will adequately provide for credit losses 
the company uses the black scholes model to value the stock option grants which involves significant judgments and estimates

historically  over of the company s revenues are generated from the sale of rf connector products and connector cable assemblies the connector and cable assembly division accounted for approximately of the company s total sales for the fiscal year ended october  
sales of connectors are expected to continue to be the largest portion of revenues in the future 
accordingly  company revenues are heavily dependent upon sales of rf connectors and cable assemblies 
however  the company sells thousands of connector products for uses in thousands of end products and sales are not dependent upon any one industry sector or any single product 
the company s sales do  however  track sales in the wireless industry as a whole

net sales increased in fiscal due primarily to a significant increase in net sales at the connector and cable assembly segment 
net sales at the connector and cable assembly segment increased from fiscal by approximately  the company believes that the increase was primarily due to the improved economic conditions at its distributors as the global recession subsided  and an increase in sales in the wireless industry in particular 
the build out of the new g and wi max wireless network systems contributed to the increase in connector sales 
net sales at the medical cabling and interconnect division also increased significantly  by  compared to its sales in fiscal however  these increases were offset by a significant decrease in sales of  compared to sales in fiscal at the rf wireless segment 
the substantial decrease in net sales at the rf wireless segment was attributable to a decrease of  in sales by the radiomobile division and a decrease of  in sales by the neulink division 
unlike the connector and cable assembly segment that has many smaller customers and a wide variety of products  the rf wireless segment has few products and few customers 
accordingly  the failure by the rf wireless segment to make a few larger sales to its customers resulted in a substantial decrease in sales

selling and general expense decreased as a percentage of sales despite a significant increase in stock based compensation expense  which increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal stock based compensation increased primarily due to the increase in options granted and also to a one time charge of  relating to the extension of a former board member s exercise period for outstanding grants
