barter transactions accounted for   and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses that are not directly related to a specific event are recorded as incurred 
expenses that specifically relate to an event are deferred until the event is held  at which time they are expensed 
these expenses include prize and point fund monies and sanction fees paid to various sanctioning bodies  including nascar  labor  marketing  cost of goods sold for merchandise and souvenirs  and other expenses associated with the promotion of our racing events 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower admissions revenue at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway and to a lesser extent lower admissions at the other major events we promoted during we promoted thirteen major events during and fourteen during we believe the decrease in attendance was attributable primarily to the general downturn in economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance 
additionally  revenue associated with our special and weekly events at our memphis facility did not recur in since that facility closed during the fourth quarter of event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower hospitality and luxury suite rentals  as well as lower concessions and souvenir sales as a result of the lower attendance and the aforementioned economic conditions 
additionally  revenue associated with our special and weekly events at our memphis facility did not recur 
broadcasting revenue increased to  in from  in the increase resulted entirely from higher broadcasting revenue for our nascar sanctioned events promoted during operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily related to cost savings from the closing of our memphis facility during the fourth quarter of  cost cutting measures that reduced operating expenses at most major events promoted during and lower costs associated with the decline in event related revenue 
general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the increase was primarily related to higher real estate taxes at our gateway facility 
additionally  the expensing of costs relating to a proposed merger with dover downs gaming entertainment  inc a company related through common ownership contributed to the increase 
the merger agreement was terminated in october these increases were partially offset by the closing of our memphis facility during the fourth quarter of we concluded in the second quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our gateway facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our gateway facility to fair value 
we closed our memphis motorsports park facility in october and executed an agreement to sell it in december the real estate sale closed on january  after closing costs and including the proceeds from the separate sale of all personal property at the facility  our net proceeds were approximately  all of which was used to pay down indebtedness of the memphis facility 
since the carrying amount of the long lived assets of the memphis facility exceeded the sales price  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of in november  we announced the closing of our gateway facility 
the gateway facility is located on approximately acres of land in madison  illinois and the racetrack is primarily on leased property 
we had long term leases for approximately acres with four landlords 
we also own approximately acres near the gateway facility 
in february  three of the four landlords agreed to terminate the land leases in exchange for acres of owned real estate and our agreement to abandon all improvements and certain personal property including the racetrack on the leased land 
as a result  we recorded an expense for facility exit costs of  at december  primarily to record a liability for the value of the real property we conveyed to the landlords in connection with terminating the leases 
as part of the lease termination agreement with one of the landlords  we provided a six month purchase option on the remaining approximately acres of owned land at  per acre  which approximates our carrying value 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  in as compared to  in during  we recognized a gain of  as a result of insurance proceeds received for damage to grandstands at our memphis facility 
net interest expense was  in as compared to  in we reversed  and  in and  respectively  of previously recorded interest expense on uncertain income tax positions which are no longer subject to examination 
excluding the interest expense we recorded related to uncertain income tax positions  our net interest expense was  in as compared to  in the increase was due primarily to a higher average interest rate on our credit facility and the amortization of higher credit facility amendment fees 
on july   we redeemed the  of remaining outstanding bonds with southwestern illinois development authority swida for  including a  premium to the bondholders 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of  including the premium  professional fees and the write off of deferred financing costs during loss before income tax benefit was  in as compared to  in excluding the non cash impairment charges and facility exit costs  our adjusted loss before income tax benefit was  in as compared to  in loss before income tax benefit non cash impairment charges facility exit costs adjusted loss before income taxes the above financial information is presented using other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap and is reconciled to comparable information presented using gaap 
non gaap adjusted loss before income taxes is derived by adjusting amounts determined in accordance with gaap for the aforementioned non cash impairment charge and facility exit costs 
we believe such non gaap information is useful and meaningful to investors  and is used by investors and us to assess core operations 
this non gaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to loss before income tax benefit which is determined in accordance with gaap 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the change in our effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of taxable income and losses within our various subsidiaries resulting primarily from the impairment charges 
certain subsidiaries had state taxable income which resulted in state income tax expense  however  other subsidiaries with state tax losses have no state income tax benefits based upon the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards

we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance 
inclement weather during the september nascar event weekend at dover international speedway also negatively impacted attendance 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to a change in our major motorsports event schedule 
the indy racing league event at our nashville superspeedway that we promoted during was not promoted in 
table of contents event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower sponsorship revenues at most events we promoted during and lower luxury suite rentals and concession sales at our nascar sprint cup series events at dover international speedway we believe as a result of economic conditions 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to the change in our major motorsports event schedule 
broadcasting revenue increased slightly from  in to  in the increase resulted entirely from higher broadcasting revenue for our nascar sanctioned events promoted during operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  decrease primarily related to cost savings initiatives implemented at all major events promoted in and a reduction in expenses due to lower revenues 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to the change in our major motorsports event schedule 
we had an earlier agreement of sale relative to our memphis motorsports park facility which expired in september  and as a result  we concluded in the third quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our memphis facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our memphis facility to fair value 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly between and from  to  the decrease resulted primarily from cost saving initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in our depreciable asset base resulting from impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of and the cessation of depreciation expense at our memphis facility which was classified as held for sale for a portion of  partially offset by depreciation on assets placed in service in and related to our monster makeover project in dover  delaware 
net interest expense decreased to  in as compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to the reversal of  of previously recorded interest expense on certain unrecognized income tax benefits which are no longer subject to examination and to a lesser extent a lower average interest rate and lower average outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
excluding the interest expense we record on certain unrecognized income tax benefits  our net interest expense was  in as compared to  in loss on sale of investments was  in and related solely to losses on the sale of available for sale securities 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the change in our effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of taxable income and losses within our various subsidiaries 
certain subsidiaries had state taxable income which resulted in state income tax expense  however  other subsidiaries with state tax losses have no state income tax benefits due to the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are seasonal in nature with a majority of our motorsports events occurring during the second and third quarters 
however  our cash flows from operating activities are more evenly spread throughout the year  primarily due to the impact of advance ticket sales and other event related cash receipts  such as sponsorship and luxury suite rentals 
the non cash impairment charges we recorded in  and had no impact on our liquidity for the three years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to the larger operating loss and lower receipts from advanced ticket sales 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was  in as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  in capital expenditures were  in compared with  in the additions related primarily to payments for concessions equipment and facility improvements 
the additions related primarily to the monster makeover project  consisting primarily of racetrack improvements at our dover facility

subsequent to redeeming the swida bonds  the remaining restricted cash was returned to us by the trustee 
net cash used in financing activities was  in as compared to  in we had net repayments on our outstanding line of credit of  in as compared to  in repayments of our outstanding swida bonds were  for as compared to  for we incurred  of premium and fees associated with the swida bond redemption during the third quarter of we paid  in cash dividends in no dividends were paid in on july   our board of directors voted to suspend the declaration of regular quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our common stock 
dividends are prohibited by our credit facility 
at december   dover motorsports  inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries  as co borrowers  were parties to a  secured revolving credit agreement with a bank group 
the maximum borrowing limit under the facility reduces to  as of june  and  as of october  and the facility expires january  there was  outstanding under the credit facility at december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit agreement is secured by all of our assets 
it provides for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements  letter of credit requirements and other general corporate purposes 
on october   we amended the credit agreement to revise certain financial covenants effective for the september  period and for the subsequent two quarterly measurement periods under the agreement  and to revise certain definitions 
interest is based  at our option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points basis points at december  depending on the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the leverage ratio or upon the base rate the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or the daily libor rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points basis points at december  depending on the leverage ratio 
the terms of the credit facility contain certain covenants including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause and prohibits the payment of dividends by us 
the credit facility also provides that if we default under any other loan agreement  that would be a default under this credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  the remaining maximum borrowings available pursuant to the credit facility were  at december   however  in order to maintain compliance with the required quarterly debt covenant calculations as of december  only  could have been borrowed as of that date 
we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants  and all other covenants  for all measurement periods during the next twelve months 
our current credit agreement is scheduled to mature on january  we are currently evaluating possible options to address the expiration of the credit facility including refinancing with a new credit facility or other available financing options 
we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to address the credit facility expiration 
in november  we announced the closing of our gateway facility 
the gateway facility is located on approximately acres of land in madison  illinois and the racetrack is primarily on leased property 
we had long term leases for approximately acres with four landlords 
we also own approximately acres near the gateway facility 
in february  three of the four landlords agreed to terminate the land leases in exchange for acres of owned real estate and our agreement to abandon all improvements and certain personal property including the racetrack on the leased land 
as a result  we recorded an expense for facility exit costs of  at december  primarily to record a liability for the value of the real property we conveyed to the landlords 
table of contents in connection with terminating the leases 
as part of the lease termination agreement with one of the landlords  we provided a six month purchase option on the remaining approximately acres of owned land at  per acre  which approximates our carrying value 
we closed our memphis motorsports park facility in october and executed an agreement to sell it in december the real estate sale closed on january  after closing costs and including the proceeds from the separate sale of all personal property at the facility  our net proceeds were approximately  all of which was used to pay down indebtedness of the memphis facility 
since the carrying amount of the long lived assets of the memphis facility exceeded the sales price  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of cash provided by operating activities is expected to substantially fund our capital expenditures 
based on current business conditions  we expect to spend approximately  on capital expenditures during additionally  we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months and also provide for our long term liquidity 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments payments due by period total thereafter revolving line of credit estimated interest payments on revolving line of credit a operating leases pension contributions b total contractual cash obligations a the future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of december  and related interest rates 
b we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for for years subsequent to  we are unable to estimate what our pension contributions will be 
in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  annual principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in us being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we believe that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will continue to satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds through the maturity date in as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during  we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes 
table of contents generated from the facility  a portion of the bonds would become our liability 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
in november  we announced the closing of our gateway facility 
the gateway facility is located on approximately acres of land in madison  illinois and the racetrack is primarily on leased property 
we had long term leases for approximately acres with four landlords 
we also own approximately acres near the gateway facility 
in february  three of the four landlords agreed to terminate the land leases in exchange for acres of owned real estate and our agreement to abandon all improvements and certain personal property including the racetrack on the leased land 
as a result  we no longer have contractual obligations related to these leases and they have been excluded from the contractual obligations disclosure 
we have not included our non current income taxes payable of  which is classified in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  in the contractual obligations disclosure since we cannot reasonably estimate whether or when a cash settlement for uncertain tax positions would occur

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance net of federal income taxes was  which increased by  in  on deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
these state net operating losses are related to our midwest facilities that have not produced taxable income 
in the event that our midwest facilities continue to generate losses for state income tax purposes in the future  our valuation allowance will increase to offset those income tax benefits 
we have considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
we perform reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the 
table of contents carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques such as the comparable sales approach 
historically the impairment assessment for track facilities has also considered the cost approach valuation technique  which gives specific consideration to the value of the track land plus the contributory value to the improvements 
the primary economic assumptions used in the valuation techniques include i land value which is estimated by comparable transactions  ii the contributory value of the track facilities calculated by estimated replacement costs  less economic depreciation  and iii that the highest and best use for the facilities is as a race track due to the contributory value of the improvements 
changes to these assumptions can have a significant effect on the outcome of future impairment tests and as a result  future valuations could differ significantly from current estimates 
see note impairment charges in the notes to the consolidated financials statements for further discussion 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by our defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with us 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that we record in our consolidated financial statements
