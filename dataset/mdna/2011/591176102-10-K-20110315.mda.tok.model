general we operate in thirty locations primarily in two distinct business segments i ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling and ii product manufacturing  fabricating  and refining of lead and other metals lead fabricating 
the scrap metal recycling segment includes twenty six scrap metal recycling facilities located in new york  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  texas  mississippi  and west virginia  and an aluminum de ox plant located in syracuse  new york 
the lead fabricating segment includes four lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for revenues  accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  the testing of goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers  based on free on board fob terms 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments in excess of reserves for such instances that would impact the ultimate collection of revenues therefore  no material provisions have been made when a sale is recognized 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  past experience with the accounts  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
derivatives and hedging we are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations 
the primary risks currently managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk 
we use forward sales 
table of contents contracts with pgm substrate processors to protect against volatile commodity prices 
this process ensures a fixed selling price for the material we purchase and process 
we secure selling prices with pgm processors  in ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium  in incremental lots for material which we expect to purchase within an average to day time period 
however  these forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors are not subject to any hedge designation as they are considered within the normal sales exemption provided by asc topic we have in the past entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the credit agreement entered into on march   with jpm chase bank  na  the company was required to terminate the million interest rate swap contract 
as a result  the company paid  to terminate the interest rate swap contract 
with the termination of the interest rate swap contract  no other interest rate swap agreement is outstanding 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of december and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for purposes of this testing  the company has determined to have seven reporting units as follows lead fabricating and recycling  new york state scrap recycling  pittsburgh scrap recycling  akron scrap recycling  youngstown scrap recycling  newark pgm recycling and texas pgm recycling 
in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit  management allocates net deferred taxes and certain corporate maintained liabilities specifically allocable to each reporting unit to the net operating assets of each reporting unit 
the carrying amount is further reduced by any impairment charges made to other indefinite lived intangibles of a reporting unit 
since market prices of our reporting units are not readily available  we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including sales volumes  profit margins  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
forecasts of operating and selling  general and administrative expenses are generally based on historical relationships of previous years 
when applying the dcf model  the cash flows expected to be generated are discounted to their present value equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the investment  as well as the time value of money 
this return is an overall rate based upon the individual rates of return for invested capital equity and interest bearing debt 
the return  known as the weighted average cost of capital wacc  is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
for our analysis  we arrived at a discount rate of 
the inputs used in calculating the wacc include i average of capital structure ratios used in previous metalico acquisition valuations  ii an estimate of combined federal and state tax rates iii the cost of baa rated debt based on moody s seasoned corporate bond yields of as of december  and iv a required return on equity determined under the modified capital asset pricing capm model 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment would be indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to the total fair value of the unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge would be recorded 

table of contents at december   we performed our annual testing for impairment of goodwill 
as part of our assessment of the recovery of goodwill  we conducted an extensive valuation analysis using an income approach based upon a five year financial projection that took into consideration the current weak economic conditions with modest recovery occurring in the second half of the impairment analysis indicated that impairment existed at four reporting units and the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for the year ended december  throughout and into  the financial markets and industries in which we operate improved from the conditions that existed at december  additionally  we have experienced an increase in the price of our common stock and total market capitalization value 
at december  and  the company s market capitalization exceeded total stockholders equity by approximately and million  respectively 
significant improvements in economic conditions in industries in which we purchase and sell material have resulted in forecasts which  when used in our dcf model  support the carrying value of our goodwill in all of our reporting units 
as a result  no indicators of impairment were identified for the years ended december  and intangible assets and other long lived assets we test all finite lived intangible assets amortizable and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment only if circumstances indicate that possible impairment exists 
to the extent actual useful lives are less than our previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization expense on a prospective basis 
we estimate useful lives of our intangible assets by reference to both contractual arrangements such as non compete covenants and current  projected  undiscounted cash flows for supplier and customer lists 
at december  and  no indicators of impairment were identified and no adjustments were made to the estimated lives of finite lived assets 
the company tests indefinite lived intangibles such as trademarks and trade names for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to its fair value 
fair value of the intangible asset is calculated using the projected discounted cash flows produced from the intangible 
if the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted cash flows attributed to the intangible asset  the carrying value is no longer considered recoverable and the company will record impairment 
at december   significant adverse changes in the global economic environment  as well as the business climate for commodities in which we operate  changes to the company s operating results and forecasts  and a significant reduction in the company s market capitalization  the carrying value of certain items of the company s other long lived assets exceeded their respective fair value as of that date 
as such  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to other intangible assets for the year ended december  stock based compensation we recognize expense for equity based compensation ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the black scholes method 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility in our stock price  annual forfeiture rates  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

table of contents results of operations the company is divided into two industry segments scrap metal recycling which breaks down into three general product categories  ferrous  non ferrous and platinum group metals  and lead fabricating

december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  average pgm prices are comprised of combined troy ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium scrap and metal commodity markets recycled iron and steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel and cast iron products 
the steel and foundry industries in the united states have been structured to recycle scrap  and  as a result  are highly dependent upon scrap 
in the united states  the primary source of old steel scrap is the automobile 
the recycling rate for automobiles in  the latest year for which statistics were available  was about  indicating a significant shrinking of the country s car and light car fleet from a high of million vehicles down to million vehicles 
a recycling rate greater than is a result of the steel industry recycling more steel from automobiles than was used in the domestic production of new vehicles 
the automotive recycling industry recycled more than million tons of steel from end of life vehicles through more than car shredders  the equivalent of more than million automobiles 
more than  vehicle dismantlers throughout north america resell parts 
recycling of scrap plays an important role in the conservation of energy because the remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron or steel products from iron ore 
also  consumption of iron and 
table of contents steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment 
recycled scrap consists of approximately post consumer old  obsolete scrap  prompt scrap produced in steel product manufacturing plants  and home scrap recirculating scrap from current operations 
steel scrap prices fluctuated widely between about and per metric ton in composite prices published by iron age scrap price bulletin for no 
heavy melting steel scrap delivered to purchasers in chicago  il  and philadelphia and pittsburgh  pa  averaged about per metric ton during the first months of as reported by iron age scrap price bulletin  the average price for nickel bearing stainless steel scrap delivered to purchasers in pittsburgh was about  per metric ton during the first months of  which was higher than the average price of  per metric ton 
the prices fluctuated widely between a low of  per metric ton in january and a high of  per ton in april and may exports of ferrous scrap decreased in to an estimated million metric tons from million metric tons during  mainly to china  the republic of korea  taiwan  malaysia  turkey  and canada  in descending order of export tonnage 
export scrap value increased from billion in to an estimated billion in north america has been experiencing a shortage of iron and steel scrap  owing to increased export demand  primarily from china  turkey  and canada 
even significantly increased prices for scrap have not led to an increase in scrap availability  because almost all old scrap had been collected from farms  ranches  and other sources  and recession hit consumers have been keeping and repairing old appliances rather than disposing of them 
also  manufacturers were decreasing production  thus producing little new scrap for the scrap market 
prices of platinum  palladium  and rhodium trended higher during the first quarter of  decreased in the middle of the year  and increased once again toward year end 
the slowly recovering global economy in  compared with the poor economic conditions of and late  affected the pgm industry 
some mines that had been previously placed on care and maintenance status were reopened in response to higher metal prices 
production of and demand for automobiles was higher throughout much of the world  particularly in developing nations such as china and india 
this led to increased pgm demand in some regions because catalytic converters are the major end use of pgms 
the proportion of diesel cars in western europe  which use platinum in their catalytic converters  returned to around after having dipped to in as a result of government scrappage plans 
those plans had led to increased purchases of smaller  more fuel efficient gasoline powered cars 
the global lead market was in surplus during owing to the continued economic slowdown and weakened demand for lead in many regions 
prices declined and stocks rose throughout the first half of the year 
monthly average london metal exchange lme lead prices began the year at  per metric ton in january and declined by during the first half of global stocks of refined lead held in lme warehouses increased by to  tons during the first months of lead prices began to increase in the third quarter of and lme stock levels appeared to stabilize compared with those earlier in the year

table of contents manufacturer financing  operating leases and other equipment lines of credit that are offered to us from time to time 
we may also access equity and debt markets for possible acquisitions  working capital and to restructure current debt 
historically  the company has entered into negotiations with its lenders when it was reasonably concerned about potential breaches and prior to the occurrences of covenant defaults 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in lending agreements could result in default under such agreements 
in the event of a default  a lender could refuse to make additional advances under the revolving portion of a credit facility  could require the company to repay some or all of its outstanding debt prior to maturity  and or could declare all amounts borrowed by the company  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
in the event that this occurs  the company may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial position and operating performance 
if necessary  the company could use its existing cash balances or attempt to access equity and debt markets or to obtain new financing arrangements with new lenders or investors as alternative funding sources to restructure current debt 
any issuance of new equity could dilute current shareholders 
any new debt financing could be on terms less favorable than those of our existing financing and could subject us to new and additional covenants 
decisions by lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company would depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s historical and projected financial performance  compliance with the terms of its current or future credit agreements  industry and market trends  internal policies of prospective lenders and investors  and the availability of capital 
no assurance can be had that the company would be successful in obtaining funds from alternative sources 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  result of operations or cash flows 
beacon energy investment as of december  and  the company owned of the outstanding stock of beacon energy holdings  inc beacon 
on january   beacon announced it had entered into a merger agreement with environmental quality management  inc the merger  which closed february   reduced our interest to approximately 
our investment in beacon was totally written off during the fourth quarter of acquisitions as discussed in note to the financial statements  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of goodman services  inc  a bradford  pennsylvania based full service recycling company with additional facilities in jamestown  new york and canton  ohio 
the acquisition is consistent with our expansion strategy of penetrating geographically contiguous markets and benefiting from intercompany and operating synergies that are available through consolidation 
goodman services locations complement our existing facilities in the great lakes corridor 
bradford is miles from our pittsburgh operations and will become a feed source for the pittsburgh shredder 
jamestown is miles from our buffalo yards 
canton  ohio is in close proximity to our operations in akron  ohio 
on december   our metalico youngstown  inc youngstown subsidiary closed a purchase of substantially all of the operating assets of youngstown iron metal  inc yim and atlas recycling inc ari two scrap related scrap recycling facilities principally located in youngstown  ohio 
the acquisition includes all inventory and equipment including a newell auto shredder located directly adjacent to yim s key consumer 
the acquisition also included all real estate owned by affiliates of the sellers and used in their businesses 
we closed the real estate portion of the transaction june  contingencies metalico  inc s subsidiary in tampa  florida  gulf coast recycling  inc is a party to two settlement agreements arising from contamination at a site in seffner  florida the jernigan site alleged to have occurred 
table of contents in the s 
required remediation at the jernigan site was substantially completed in the company estimates future maintenance costs for the jernigan site at  the accompanying financial statements do not include any receivables that might result from any additional settlements or recoveries 
we are involved in certain other legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such other proceedings and litigation will not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability other than conditions existing at the syracuse facility prior to its acquisition by the company because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical 
however  we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement with jpmchase bank 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
increases in either the prime rate or libor may increase interest expense 
assuming our variable borrowings at december  were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year with a corresponding change in cash flows 
we have no open interest rate protection agreements as of december  commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous  non ferrous  pgm and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and export markets can be volatile located in this annual report 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly as markets allow instead of holding inventories in anticipation of higher commodity prices 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to hedge against the extremely volatile pgm metal prices 
the company estimates that if selling prices decreased by in any of the business units in which it operates  there would not be a material write down of any of its reported inventory values 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates 
risk from common stock market price we are exposed to risks associated with the market price of our own common stock 
in connection with certain financings  we have issued warrants that can be put to us upon a change of control 
we are required to use the value of our common stock as an input variable to determine the fair value of the liability associated with the put warrant 
fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have an effect on the liability 
for example  if the price of our common stock was higher as of december   the put warrant liability would increase by
