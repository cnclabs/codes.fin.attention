goodwill and intangible assets as of may   we had fully impaired all of our goodwill related to each of our segments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the results of our goodwill impairment tests indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our edg segment was fully impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of these segments exceeded their fair value  and the carrying amount of goodwill of our edg segment exceeded the implied goodwill value as of the february   measurement date 
as a result  we recorded pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million for edg  during the fourth quarter of fiscal gain loss on disposal of assets loss on disposal of assets from continuing operations was less than million during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we decided not to proceed with the implementation of various modules of enterprise resource management software that were in the development stage and thus were capitalized in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other internal use software asc 
as a result  we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of million during the third quarter of fiscal on february   we sold our building in mexico city  mexico  for million 
we recorded an immaterial gain during the third quarter of fiscal with respect to the sale of this property 
other income expense other income expense was expense of million during fiscal  compared with expense of million during fiscal the decrease in expense during fiscal was due primarily to income from new investments  offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
other income expense included investment interest income of million during fiscal foreign exchange was a loss of million during fiscal  as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of us currency we have in non us bank accounts

the effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal   and  were   and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory rate of during fiscal and  and during fiscal  primarily results from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses  release of valuation allowances related to net operating losses  and release of various income tax reserves due to audit closures or statutes expiring 
as of may   all domestic federal net operating loss nol carryforwards were fully utilized 
domestic state nol carryforwards amounted to approximately million  primarily related to states where the utilization of nols have been suspended for the next four taxable years 
foreign nol carryforwards totaled approximately million with various or indefinite expiration dates 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforward and all foreign tax credit carryforwards were also fully utilized as of may  based on this  our future us federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to  our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 
income taxes paid  including foreign estimated tax payments  were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
as of may   million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to asc  income taxes other considerations or special areas asc 
due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing  it is not practical to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we are no longer subject to either us federal  state or local  or us tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal currently  we are under federal audit in the us for fiscal years and based on the recent commencement of the audit  no tax matters have arisen that would result in material adjustments 
our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are china  japan  germany  singapore  and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in singapore beginning in fiscal  in japan beginning in fiscal  in the netherlands and germany beginning in fiscal  and in china beginning in calendar year discontinued operations arrow transaction on march   we completed the closing of the transaction 
the total consideration paid by arrow at the closing of the transaction was million which included an estimated pre closing working capital adjustment 
the final purchase price is subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 

table of contents on june   we received notification from arrow seeking a post closing working capital adjustment  which would reduce the purchase price by approximately million 
the million is included in our results from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended may  following the transaction  the compensation committee of our board of directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the transaction 
the cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately million  and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal to help facilitate the transition of rfpd to arrow  we agreed to provide certain transitional services to arrow such as financial support services  warehouse services  and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services  warehouse services  and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
the duration of the transitional services are less than one year from march   except for the information technology services which is three years 
in addition  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with arrow  in connection with the transaction  for a term of three years 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreement  we agreed to manufacture certain products for arrow 
the transition services agreement  which commenced on march   will allow us to exert very limited influence over arrow s operating and financial policies 
also  the continuing cash flows related to our transition services agreement as well as the manufacturing agreement  are insignificant 
we believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the transition services agreement that relate to financial support  certain facilities  and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to rfpd 
we further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the manufacturing agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to rfpd 
honeywell transaction on may   we completed the sale of the security systems division burtek systems ssd burtek to honeywell international inc honeywell 
the sale agreement of ssd burtek to honeywell contemplated a post closing working capital based purchase price adjustment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we received notification from honeywell seeking a purchase price adjustment and we issued a dispute notice in a timely manner 
on december   we reached an agreement with honeywell to settle the pending working capital disputes as well as other related claims 
as a result  we recorded million of expense  net of zero tax effect  as a loss from discontinued operations during fiscal financial summary discontinued operations summary financial results for fiscal   and are presented in the following table in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses goodwill impairment gain loss on disposal of assets interest expense  net foreign exchange gain pre tax gain on sale income tax provision benefit income from discontinued operations  net of tax 
table of contents in accordance with asc  the allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations of other consolidated interest that is not directly attributable to or related to other operations of the entity is permitted but not required 
the consolidated interest that cannot be attributed to other operations of the entity is allocated based on the ratio of net assets to be sold or discontinued to the total consolidated net assets 
we appropriately allocated approximately million  million  and million of interest expense to discontinued operations for fiscal   and  respectively  using the ratio of net assets that we sold or that became discontinued to total assets 
assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated balance sheets as of may   and may   include the following in thousands may  may  accounts receivable inventories prepaid expenses and other assets current deferred income taxes property  plant  and equipment  net non current deferred income taxes discontinued operations assets accounts payable accrued liabilities other non current liabilities long term income tax liabilities discontinued operations liabilities accrued liabilities as of may   includes million due to arrow which includes a million proposed purchase price adjustment  million for receivables collected by the company on behalf of arrow  and vacation and pension funds of million in connection with the transaction 
there is also approximately million of other accrued liabilities including severance and success bonuses recorded in connection with the transaction 
these amounts are partially offset by approximately million owed to the company from arrow in connection with the transaction which consists of fees for transition services  facility lease deposits  severance costs  and indirect taxes 
in accordance with asc  statement of cash flows  entities are permitted but not required to separately disclose  either in the statement of cash flows or footnotes to the financial statements  cash flows pertaining to discontinued operations 
entities that do not present separate operating cash flow information related to discontinued operations must do so consistently for all periods presented  which may include periods long after the sale or liquidation of the operation 
we currently do not have cash balances that are specific to rfpd and as a result  we believe that it is appropriate to not present separate cash flows from discontinued operations on our statement of cash flows 
liquidity  financial position  and capital resources our growth and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
liquidity under our revolving credit facility is primarily available to fund our working capital requirements and support capital expenditures 
as a result of accounting for rfpd as a discontinued operation  we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities will continue to be a source of cash 
while net income will significantly decline as a result of the sale  our working capital investment and capital spending requirements will also significantly decline

entities that do not present separate operating cash flows information related to discontinued operations must do so consistently for all periods presented  which may include periods long after the sale or liquidation of the operation 
we currently do not have cash balances that are specific to rfpd and as a result  we believe that the appropriate presentation would be to not separate cash flows from discontinued operations on our statement of cash flows 
upon closing the transaction  we received million which included an estimated pre closing working capital adjustment 
on june   we received notification from arrow seeking a post closing working capital adjustment of approximately million 
we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth strategies for our remaining business

excluding the transaction  cash used by operating activities  including discontinued operations  was million 
cash provided by operating activities  including our discontinued operations  during fiscal was million  due primarily to lower inventory balances and higher accounts payable  partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances 
the decline in inventory balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million and inventory provisions of million  during fiscal  was due primarily to increased sales volume and higher inventory turns 
the increase in accounts payable balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  during fiscal  was due primarily to the timing of payments 
the increase in accounts receivable balances of million  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange of million during fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities  including our discontinued operations  of million during fiscal  was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of rfpd of million  partially offset by the purchase of million in time deposits and cds  capital expenditures of million for information technology projects and building improvements  and million for market value adjustments on our investments 
net cash used in investing activities  including our discontinued operations  of million during fiscal  was due primarily to capital expenditures of million for information technology projects and building improvements  and million for the cash settlement related to ssd burtek 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities  including our discontinued operations  of million during fiscal was due primarily to the repayment of our short term debt  repurchase of common stock  and cash dividends paid  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock

dividend payments during fiscal were approximately million 
all future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend payments will depend on earnings  capital requirements  operating conditions  and such other factors that the board may deem relevant 
as of may   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  as we paid down the million outstanding balance  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and terminated the agreement on february  on june   we redeemed all million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our notes  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
see note debt of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the redemption 
contractual obligations contractual obligations by expiration period are presented in the table below as of may  in thousands less than year years years more than years total lease obligations it services total lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases 
it services are related to the transaction 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity  including current cash  will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management continuously evaluates the significant estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  goodwill impairment testing  income taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  
table of contents aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of may   and may   respectively 
impairment of investments we hold a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assess its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and our cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
we recognized investment impairment charges of less than million during fiscal we did not recognize any investment impairment charges during fiscal and revenue recognition our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment  when title passes to the customer  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
our sales are recorded net of discounts and returns based on our historical experience 
our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications 
our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs 
our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell 
in a limited number of cases  we provide and bill our customers with non product related services  such as testing  calibration  non recurring engineering  tooling  and installation services 
we have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we have also concluded that  in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product  the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory 
this conclusion was reached based on the following facts the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer  which in most cases  is performed immediately after the delivery of the product  the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal  the costs and time do not vary significantly  we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely  and finally  failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service 
inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
our inventories included million of finished goods and million of raw materials and work in progress 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges  obsolescence  the exiting of certain market segments  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand  changes in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 

table of contents discontinued operations in accordance with asc  presentation of financial statements discontinued operations asc  we reported the financial results of rfpd as a discontinued operation 
refer to note discontinued operations of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the sale of rfpd 
loss contingencies we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of a possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred  we will include a disclosure describing the contingency 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
we assess in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its net realizable value 
the impairment charge is recorded in operating results 
the results of our impairment tests for fiscal and indicated no impairment of our long lived assets 
warranties we offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture 
we also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
our warranty terms generally range from one to three years 
we estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
we record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
each quarter  we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product by product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation 
with respect to new products  estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products  the extended warranty period  and warranty experience 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other available evidence

stock compensation effective june   we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options 
we estimate fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life  and dividends

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence 
these factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we  or any of our affiliates  have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards

new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asc update no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  asc update no 

this amends the fasb accounting standards codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu update no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu update no 
should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim period within those years  beginning after december   and as such  we will adopt asc update no 
during our third quarter of fiscal in october  the fasb issued asc update no  revenue recognition  asc update no 
 which addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  the guidance amends the criteria in fasb asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
the guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  the guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asc update no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include foreign currency exchange risks  as certain operations  assets  and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks through normal operating activities 
the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates and interest rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect our operations 
additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in part i  item a  risk factors of our annual report on this form k 
foreign currency exposure even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken  our financial statements denominated in a non us functional currency are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and intercompany receivables and payables  as we conduct business in countries of the european union  asia pacific and  to a lesser extent  canada and latin america 
we could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts  local debt to offset asset exposures  and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions
