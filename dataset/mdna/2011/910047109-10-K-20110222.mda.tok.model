our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly 
our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft 
as discussed under alliances below  united and continental are both members of star alliance  the world s largest airline network 

table of contents the company offers a different set of services to target distinct customer groups 
this strategy of market and product segmentation is intended to optimize margins and costs  and is focused on delivering an improved experience for all customers and a best in class experience for premium customers 
some of these services include services united first and business class seating on transcontinental flights and united economy plus  the latter providing three to five inches of extra legroom on all mainline flights 
international premium travel experience featuring degree  lie flat beds in first and business class 
certain aircraft have been refitted with new premium seats  entertainment systems and other product enhancements

eliteaccess passengers receive priority treatment in check in  boarding and baggage claim areas  the ability to check up to three bags without fees and access to special security lanes at certain airports 
regional carriers 
the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express  continental express and continental connection 
these regional operations are an extension of the company s mainline network 
this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows more frequent flights to smaller cities than could be provided economically with full sized mainline jet aircraft 
atlantic southeast airlines  chautauqua airlines  colgan airlines colgan  commutair airlines  expressjet airlines  gojet airlines  mesa airlines  shuttle america  skywest airlines skywest and trans states airlines 
table of contents trans states are all regional carriers  most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements with united and or continental 
under these agreements  the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carrier controlled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics 
the carrier controlled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers  such as crew expenses  maintenance and aircraft ownership  some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg  block hours  departures while others are fixed monthly amounts 
under these capacity purchase agreements  the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees  facilities rent and other costs  which are passed through without any markup 
in return  the regional carriers operate this capacity on schedules determined by the company 
the company also determines pricing  revenues and inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 
while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than of all regional flights  the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service  inc cape air  colgan  gulfstream international airlines gulfstream  skywest and trans states 
under prorate agreements  the company and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula  while both the company and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations 
unlike capacity purchase agreements  under a prorate agreement  the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling  market selection  local seat pricing and inventory for its flights  although the carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 
financial information on the company s operating revenues by geographic regions  as reported to the us department of transportation the dot  can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
alliances 
united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines  which enhance travel options for customers seeking access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly 
these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features joint loyalty program participation  codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier  coordination of reservations  ticketing  passenger check in  baggage handling and flight schedules  and other resource sharing activities 
united and continental are members of star alliance  a global integrated airline network co founded by united in and the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world 
as of january   star alliance carriers served  airports in countries with  daily flights 
current star alliance partners  in addition to united and continental  are adria airways  aegean airlines  air canada  air china  air new zealand  all nippon airways  asiana airlines  austrian airlines  blue  bmi  brussels airlines  croatia airlines  egyptair  lot polish airlines  lufthansa  scandinavian airlines  singapore airlines  south african airways  spanair  swiss international air lines  tam  tap portugal  thai  turkish airlines and us airways 
air india  avianca taca and copa airlines have been announced as future star alliance members 
in september  united  continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenue sharing  transborder joint venture  subject to the execution of a definitive joint venture agreement  completion of necessary filings  receipt of regulatory approvals and finalization of documentation 
united  continental and air canada have antitrust immunity from the dot for transborder coordination 
the joint venture is currently under review by the canadian competition bureau 
in november  united  continental and all nippon airways received antitrust immunity approval from the japanese government and the dot enabling the carriers to establish a trans pacific joint venture to integrate the services they operate between the united states and japan  and other destinations in asia  and to derive potentially significant benefits from coordinated scheduling  pricing  sales and inventory management 
the integration of services will also allow the three carriers to offer passengers highly competitive flight schedules  fares and services 
we expect this joint venture to commence in the second quarter of 
table of contents in december  pursuant to antitrust immunity approval granted by the dot  united  continental  air canada and lufthansa executed a joint venture agreement covering trans atlantic routes 
the joint venture is expected to deliver highly competitive flight schedules  fares and service 
the european commission  which has been conducting a parallel review of the competitive effects of the joint venture similar to the dot s review  has not yet completed its review 
the joint venture has a revenue sharing structure that results in payments among participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on trans atlantic routes to an historic period  or baseline  which is reset annually 
the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and subject to a cap 
the revenue sharing aspects of this joint venture were retroactive to january see industry regulation below 
united and continental have independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aer lingus  cape air  colgan  copa airlines  emirates  eva airways corporation  great lakes aviation  gulfstream  hawaiian airlines  island air  qatar airways  taca group  and virgin atlantic airways 
in addition  continental has a train to plane alliance with amtrak 
fuel 
aircraft fuel has been the company s single largest operating expense for the last several years 
the table below summarizes ual s fuel cost data  excluding hedge impacts  during the last three years 
year gallons consumed in millions fuel cost excluding hedge impacts b in millions average price per gallon excluding hedge impacts b percentage of total operating expense c a a a a excludes continental predecessor fuel consumption and cost prior to october  b excludes fuel hedge gains losses classified within fuel expense of million  million and million for   and  respectively 
c calculation excludes special charges identified in item of this report 
the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company s operations  results of operations and financial position 
to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to obtain a measure of control over prices in the short term  the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations 
to protect against increases in the prices of fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements  provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective 
the company uses fixed price swaps  purchased call options  collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil and crude oil 
the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure generally consistent with industry standards so that the company s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 
loyalty programs 
united s mileage plus program and continental s onepass program build customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants 
members in these programs can earn mileage credit for flights on united  united express  continental  continental express and continental connection  members of star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the programs 
miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our non airline partners  such as retail merchants  hotels  car rental companies and credit card issuers 
mileage credits can be redeemed for free  discounted or upgraded travel and non travel awards 
at december   united and continental had more than million and million members  respectively  enrolled in their programs 
both of the company s loyalty programs have co brand agreements with chase bank usa  na chase 
under these agreements  loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using mileage plus and onepass credit cards issued by chase 
these co brand agreements provide for joint marketing of the credit card programs and provide chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company s customer database 

table of contents in  million mileage plus travel awards were used on united  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these awards represented  and of united s total revenue passenger miles in  and  respectively 
also in  million onepass travel awards were used on continental  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these awards represented  and of continental s total revenue passenger miles in  and  respectively 
in addition  mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately  non united travel awards in as compared to  in non united travel awards include red carpet club memberships  car and hotel awards  merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier  among others 
the increase in the number of non united travel awards redeemed in was due to the expansion of the merchandise programs and the launch of a new car and hotel award program in the fourth quarter of total miles redeemed for travel on united in  including class of service upgrades  represented of the total miles redeemed for both completed and future travel 
distribution channels 
the majority of the company s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems gds 
the growing use of internal websites  such as www 
united 
com and www 
continental 
com  alternative distribution systems and new gds entrants provides the company with an opportunity to de commoditize its services  better control its content  make more targeted offerings  retain its customers  enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs 
to encourage customer use of lower cost channels and capitalize on these cost saving opportunities  the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its websites and explore alternative distribution channels 
industry conditions economic conditions 
the company s costs and revenues are highly correlated to the economic health and growth of the united states and the global markets the company serves 
the company s financial performance improved significantly in consistent with the improvement in global economic conditions 
similarly  the company s results were adversely impacted in and as the global recession experienced over this period resulted in significant declines in industry passenger demand  accompanied by a reduction in fare levels 
the drop in demand was greater among business and premium cabin travelers  as corporations significantly reduced their spending on business travel 
as discussed further in item a  risk factors  and in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  adverse economic conditions have had  and in the future may have  negative impacts on passenger demand and revenue 
domestic competition 
the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic 
in domestic markets  new and existing us carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states 
the company s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and  to a lesser extent  other forms of transportation and emerging technological substitutes such as videoconferencing 
competition can be direct  in the form of another carrier flying the exact non stop route  or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities non stop from an alternative airport in that city  or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 
carriers that operate as low cost carriers or that have lower cost structures achieved through reorganization may be more competitive with the rest of the industry  resulting in lower fares for such carriers passengers with a potential negative impact on the company s revenues 
in addition  future airline mergers or acquisitions may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 
domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to be competitive with other us airlines 
fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we often find it necessary to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic 
attempts by the company and other airlines to raise fares often fail due to a lack of competitive matching 

table of contents international competition 
in international markets the company competes not only with us airlines  but also with foreign carriers 
competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations 
the united states and european union eu agreement in to reduce restrictions on flight operations between the two regions has increased competition for united s transatlantic network from both us and european airlines 
in our pacific operations  competition is expected to increase as the governments of the united states and china recently approved additional us and chinese airlines to fly new routes between the two countries  although the commencement of some new services to china was postponed due to the weak global economy 
competition in the pacific is also expected to increase as a result of the execution of the open skies agreement between the united states and japan in october see industry regulation  below 
competition in the pacific may also increase if japan airlines  which filed for bankruptcy in january and received reorganization plan approval in november  becomes a stronger competitor in the region as a result of its restructuring 
part of the company s ability to compete successfully with non us carriers on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from and to the entire us via its integrated domestic route network 
foreign carriers are currently prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and the company experiences comparable restrictions in many foreign countries 
in addition  us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments 
to compensate partially for these structural limitations  us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to exchange traffic between each other s flights and route networks 
see alliances  above  for further information 
seasonality 
the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  second and third quarter revenues  which reflect higher travel demand  are better than first and fourth quarter revenues  which reflect lower travel demand 
industry regulation domestic regulation 
general 
all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the dot 
among its responsibilities  the dot issues certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation  no air carrier  unless exempted  may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity 
the dot also grants international route authorities  approves international codeshare arrangements  regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection statutes and regulations  such as those dealing with advertising  denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 
airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration faa  a division of the dot  primarily in the areas of flight operations  maintenance and other safety and technical matters 
the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates  prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training  among other responsibilities 
from time to time  the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions  such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment  that may cause the company to incur substantial  unplanned expenses 
the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations 
the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security 
see legislation  below 
the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters 
the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail 
labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla 
the company is also subject to inquiries by the dot  faa  doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 
airport access 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united and continental are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc 
table of contents washington reagan  john f 
kennedy international airport jfk  laguardia airport laguardia and new york liberty 
in addition  to address concerns about airport congestion  the faa has designated certain airports  including new york liberty  jfk and laguardia as high density traffic airports and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports  which may include capacity reductions 
additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company s rights of ownership and transfer 
legislation 
the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs 
in addition to federal  state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company s operating costs if imposed on the company 
congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations 
past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry  including air traffic control operations  capacity control issues  airline competition issues  aircraft and airport technology requirements  safety issues  taxes  fees and other funding sources 
congress may also pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs 
climate change legislation  which would regulate greenhouse gas emissions  is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company s costs 
see environmental regulation  below 
in april  the dot implemented a new rule requiring certain air carriers  including united and continental  to adopt contingency plans for tarmac delays exceeding three hours at most us airports 
a carrier s failure to meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could subject it to substantial civil penalties 
the dot has also proceeded with other regulatory changes in this area  including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to passengers involuntarily denied boarding  domestic baggage liability and airline scheduling practices 
additionally  since september   aviation security has been  and continues to be  a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action  requiring changes to the company s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 
in september  the faa proposed changes to flight crew duty and rest requirements for all us airlines operating under part of faa regulations 
these changes  if adopted by the faa as initially proposed  would likely require us to make changes to our flight operations that could materially increase our costs 
continental  united and other airlines and trade associations have submitted comments to the faa to reduce these proposed burdens substantially  but it is unclear at this time whether the faa will adopt them in its final rule 
international regulation 
general 
international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation 
in connection with the company s international services  the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries united and continental serve 
in addition  the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments  and in some cases  fares and schedules require the approval of the dot and or the relevant foreign governments 
airport access 
historically  access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved 
these agreements regulate the markets served  the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights 
since the early s  the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all us flag carriers have access to the destination  under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets 
currently  there are more than open skies agreements in effect 
additionally  many of the airports that united and continental serve in europe  asia and latin america  maintain slot controls 
a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports 
london heathrow international airport london heathrow  frankfurt rhein main airport  shanghai pudong 
table of contents international airport  beijing capital international airport  sao paulo guarhulos international airport and tokyo narita international airport are among the most restrictive airports due to capacity limitations 
united and continental have significant operations at these locations 
the company s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments 
shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements 
depending on the nature of any such change  the value of the company s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 
the us eu open skies agreement provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights  including the right to operate between any point in the united states and the eu 
the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights or airport facilities nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots or facilities  including those at london heathrow 
because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on the company s business  the overall future impact of the us eu agreement on the company s business cannot be predicted with certainty 
in october  the open skies agreement between the united states and japan became effective  enabling us or japanese carriers to fly between any point in the united states and any point in japan and  in the case of us carriers  beyond japan to points in other countries the carrier is authorized to serve 
the agreement eliminates the restrictions on the number of frequencies carriers can operate and requires governments in both the united states and japan to concur before taking action to regulate a carrier s fares or rates 
environmental regulation 
general 
the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to surface and subsurface waters  safe drinking water  aircraft noise  and the management of hazardous substances  oils and waste materials 
areas of developing regulations include new regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below  state of california rule makings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment  and a federal rule making concerning the discharge of deicing fluid 
climate change 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the eu emissions trading scheme ets which is subject to legal challenge  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center and co located cogeneration plant 
in addition  there are land use planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in  the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets  which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january  beginning in  the ets would require the company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from eu member states with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government 
in december  the air transportation association  joined by united  continental and american airlines  filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers 
in addition  non eu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations international civil aviation organization icao with respect to the eu s inclusion of non eu carriers 
if the scheme is found to be valid  it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits  although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables 
those potential costs will depend  among other things  on the baseline carbon emissions yet to be determined by the eu  the company s future carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu  and the price of carbon credits 

table of contents in addition to current regulatory programs  there is also the potential for additional climate change regulation 
in  the administrator of the us environmental protection agency epa found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare 
although legal challenges have been initiated and legislative proposals are expected that may invalidate this endangerment finding and or the epa s assertion of authority under the clean air act  the finding could result in epa regulation of commercial aircraft emissions 
further  the icao recently signaled through an icao assembly resolution that it will be developing a regulatory scheme for aviation greenhouse gas emissions 
there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government  state governments within the us  foreign governments  or through a separate united nations global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry  which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions 
the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant  including the potential for increased fuel costs  carbon taxes or fees  or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 
other environmental matters 
in addition  the dot allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems  provided those procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system and do not conflict with federal law 
some us and foreign airports  including airports located in certain of our hub cities  have established airport restrictions to limit noise  including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations 
in some instances  these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs  and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 
the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund  and similar environmental cleanup laws  generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions 
the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions 
environmental cleanup obligations can arise from  among other circumstances  the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites 
future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business

such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date  upon which the contract is considered open for amendment 
contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated 
during the negotiation period  both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo 
the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of united s and continental s collective bargaining agreements and union policies

in march  continental reached a tentative agreement on a new four year labor contract with the union that represents its dispatchers  which was ratified in april in september  continental reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the union that represents its aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees  which was ratified in november continental negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters covering its fleet service employees in november which was ratified in december in january  continental reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the union that represents its flight attendants 
the agreement is scheduled for a ratification vote  the results of which are expected to be announced on or around february  after the company s may merger announcement  alpa opted to suspend negotiations at both united and continental to focus on joint negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement that would apply to the combined company 
in july  united and continental reached agreement with alpa on a transition and process agreement that provides a framework for conducting pilot operations for the two employee groups until the parties reach agreement on a joint collective bargaining agreement and the carriers obtain a single operating certificate 
in august  united and continental began joint negotiations with alpa and those negotiations are presently ongoing 
in december  alpa and the company jointly applied to the nmb for mediation assistance for pilots and flight instructors 
in january  the iam filed an application seeking single carrier findings by the nmb for purposes of union representation covering fleet service employees at continental and ramp service employees at united 
also in january  the afa announced that it had filed a similar request with the nmb for purposes of union representation for united and continental flight attendants 
the company anticipates that other applications will be filed by various unions covering smaller groups of employees 
if the nmb determines that united and continental are considered a single carrier  the relevant employees may vote with respect to union representation 
until elections occur  the incumbent unions will continue to represent those employee groups who are currently represented 
the outcome of these labor negotiations may materially impact the company s future financial results 
however  the company is unable at this time to assess the timing or magnitude of such impact  if any 
item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company s business and the forward looking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
the merger may present certain material risks to the company s business and operations 
the merger  described in item  business  may present certain risks to the company s business and operations including  among other things  risks that we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and workforces of united and continental  conditions  terms  obligations or restrictions relating to the merger that may be imposed on us by regulatory authorities may adversely affect the company s business and operations  
table of contents we may lose additional management personnel and other key employees and may be unable to attract and retain such personnel and employees  we may be unable to successfully manage the expanded business with respect to monitoring new operations and associated increased costs and complexity  we may be unable to avoid potential liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger and integration  we may be unable to successfully manage the complex integration of systems  technology  aircraft fleets  networks and other assets of united and continental in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers  vendors  suppliers  employees and other constituencies  our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be limited  branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers  we may experience disruption of  or inconsistencies in  each of united s and continental s standards  controls  procedures  policies and services  and we may be unable to successfully negotiate and maintain current or future strategic partnerships of united and continental on terms acceptable to the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect  that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 
certain of the company s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 
the company may be unable to continue to comply with the covenants in these agreements 
a failure to comply with these covenants could result in the accelerated maturity of debt obligations  which could materially and adversely affect the company s liquidity 
united s amended and restated revolving credit  term loan and guaranty agreement  dated as of february  the amended credit facility  the indenture governing continental s senior secured notes due the notes and the indentures governing united s senior secured notes due and senior second lien notes due the united senior notes  and together with the notes  the senior notes impose certain operating and financial covenants  as applicable  on the company  on united and its material subsidiaries  or on continental and its subsidiaries 
among other covenants  the amended credit facility requires ual  united and certain of united s material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the amended credit facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined in the amended credit facility of billion at all times  a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter 
among other covenants  the indentures governing the senior notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations 
if the value of the collateral underlying that issuer s senior notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations  the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of per annum  provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders lien or repay a portion of the senior notes 

table of contents the company s ability to comply with the covenants in the amended credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes may be affected by events beyond its control  including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs  and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 
the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers  amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to the company 
a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility or indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations 
in addition  the indentures governing the united senior notes contain a cross acceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility would result in a default under such indentures 
a default under these indentures could allow holders of the united senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the obligations in these indentures 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of our operating and financial covenants under certain of the company s financing agreements 
the company may be unable to continue to comply with certain covenants in agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions  which  if not complied with  could materially and adversely affect the company s liquidity 
united and continental have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services 
under certain of united s and continental s credit card processing agreements  the financial institutions either require  or under certain circumstances have the right to require  that united and continental maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution  but for which united and continental have not yet provided the air transportation referred to as relevant advance ticket sales 
united s credit card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan chase contains a cash reserve requirement  determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by united as defined under the amended credit facility 
if united s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than billion as of any calendar month end measurement date  its required reserve will remain at million 
however  if united s unrestricted cash balance is less than billion or certain lower minimum cash amounts  its required reserve will increase to stated percentages of relevant advance ticket sales that could be significant 
based on united s december  unrestricted cash balance  united was not required to provide cash collateral above the current million reserve balance 
under united s credit card processing agreement with american express  in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express  united is required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar month end measurement date with united s required reserves increasing to stated percentages of net current exposure that could be significant as united s unrestricted cash balance falls below certain minimum cash amounts 
the agreement with american express permits united to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral  as long as united s unrestricted cash is above billion 
such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof  with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement 
replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft  slots and routes  real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties 
based on united s unrestricted cash balance at december   united was not required to provide any reserves under this agreement 
continental s credit card processing agreement with jpmorgan chase and affiliates of jpmorgan chase contains financial covenants that require  among other things  that continental post additional cash collateral if it fails to maintain a minimum level of continental s unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  a minimum ratio of continental s unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
table of contents to current liabilities of to or a minimum senior unsecured debt rating for continental of at least caa and ccc from moody s and standard poor s  respectively 
if a covenant trigger under the jpmorgan chase processing agreement results in continental s posting additional collateral under that agreement  continental will also be required to post additional collateral under its credit card processing agreement with american express that could be significant 
if continental s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than billion as of any calendar month end measurement date  its required reserve will remain at million 
however  if continental s unrestricted cash balance is less than billion or certain lower minimum cash amounts  its required reserve will increase to stated percentages of relevant advance ticket sales that could be significant 
based on continental s december  unrestricted cash balance  continental was not required to provide cash collateral above the current million reserve balance 
an increase in the future reserve requirements and the posting of a significant amount of cash collateral  as provided by the terms of any or all of united s and continental s material credit card processing agreements  could materially reduce the company s liquidity 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this report for a detailed discussion of our obligations under the company s credit card processing agreements 
the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations  including aircraft lease and debt financings  leases of airport property and other facilities  and other material cash obligations 
in addition  the company has substantial non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures  including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 
while the company s cash flows from operations and its available capital  including the proceeds from financing transactions  have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date  the company s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item a  including  but not limited to  substantial volatility in the price of fuel  adverse economic conditions and disruptions in the global capital markets 
in the event that the company s liquidity is constrained due to the factors noted above or otherwise  the company s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements  timely pay its debts  or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences  including the acceleration of the company s indebtedness  the increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements  the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company s financial position and results of operations 
further  certain of the company s debt is secured by collateral and the company may have limited remaining assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness  which may make it difficult to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs 
the company s level of indebtedness  non investment grade credit rating and the current market conditions may also make it difficult for the company to raise capital to meet its liquidity needs and may increase its cost of borrowing 
a higher cost of capital could negatively impact its results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding the company s liquidity 
economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions 
the airline industry is highly cyclical  and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies 
robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely 
table of contents on favorable general economic conditions  including the strength of the global and local economies  low unemployment levels  strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 
for leisure travelers  air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that those consumers can eliminate from their spending in difficult economic times 
in addition  during periods of unfavorable economic conditions  businesses usually reduce the volume of their business travel  either due to cost savings initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel 
the overall demand for air transportation in the united states significantly decreased in and due to the severe global economic recession  and this decline in demand disproportionately reduced the volume of high yield traffic in the premium cabins on domestic and international flights  as many business travelers either curtailed their travel or purchased lower yield economy tickets 
decreases in passenger and cargo demand that resulted in lower passenger volumes and lower ticket fares had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations in and while some economic indicators are beginning to exhibit growth  other economic indicators that may reflect an economic recovery  such as unemployment  may not improve for an extended period of time 
in addition  decreases in cargo revenues due to lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results as our cargo revenues generally have higher margins as compared to our passenger revenues 
stagnant or worsening global economic conditions that contribute to reduced passenger and cargo revenues may have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition to its effect on demand for our services  the global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital markets  resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable 
although access to the capital markets has improved  if economic conditions again worsen or these markets experience further disruptions  we may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 
continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
expenditures for aircraft fuel and related taxes represent one of the largest single costs of operating the company s business 
the company s financial condition and result of operations may be significantly impacted by the availability and price of aircraft fuel 
while the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term  the company cannot predict the continued future availability of aircraft fuel 
at times  due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry  the company has not been able to increase its fares or other fees sufficiently to offset increased fuel costs 
fuel prices continue to be volatile which may negatively impact the company s liquidity in the future 
the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry 
in addition  any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the fuel price increase and may reduce the demand for air travel 
the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs 
however  the company s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances  may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors 
in addition  significant declines in fuel prices may increase the costs associated with the company s fuel hedging arrangements to the extent it has entered into swaps or collars 
swaps and sold put options as part of a collar may obligate us to make payments to the counterparty upon settlement of the contracts if the price of the commodity hedged falls below the agreed upon amount 
declining crude and related oil prices may result in the company posting significant amounts of collateral to cover potential amounts owed beyond certain credit based thresholds with respect to swap and collar contracts that have not yet settled 
also  lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares  especially to the extent that reduced fuel costs justify increased utilization by airlines of less fuel efficient aircraft 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the company s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against increases or declines in fuel costs or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company s hedging arrangements 
additionally  deterioration in the company s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 
see note to the financial statements included in item for additional information on the company s hedging programs 
terrorist attacks or international hostilities  or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities  even if not made directly on the airline industry  could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 
the terrorist attacks of september  involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united s and continental s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the prospects for the airline industry 
among the effects experienced from the september  terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faa imposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry s fleet  significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience  increased insurance costs  substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 
additional terrorist attacks  even if not made directly on the airline industry  or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry 
wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the company s financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states or us interests 
the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition 
in recent years  the market share held by low cost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase 
the increased market presence of low cost carriers  which engage in substantial price discounting  has diminished the ability of large network carriers to exercise pricing power and maintain sufficient fare levels in domestic markets to achieve sustained profitability 
airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity  including route systems and the number of markets served 
several of the company s domestic competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves  causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations 
in addition  the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to the global recession 
further  certain of the company s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity  thereby diminishing the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions 
this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company faces and may to continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures 
a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs 
carriers operating under 
table of contents bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 
since  the us airline industry has experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions 
the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures 
carriers entering into and participating in airline alliances and or joint ventures may also become strong competitors as they are able to coordinate routes  pool revenues and costs  and enjoy other mutual benefits  achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 
open skies agreements  including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan  may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 
there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry reorganizations or consolidations could occur in the future 
the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position  including alliances  asset acquisitions and divestitures and business combinations  and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities 
if other airlines participate in such activities  those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities  thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 
additional security requirements may increase the company s costs and decrease its revenues and traffic 
since september   the department of homeland security dhs and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and costs  including the presence of federal air marshals  use of passenger data  limitations on the content of carry on baggage  expanded cargo and baggage screening  and body scanning  fingerprinting and photographing  and are likely to implement additional measures in the future 
in addition  foreign governments have also instituted additional security measures at foreign airports the company serves 
a substantial portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers  increasing the company s costs and or reducing its revenue and traffic 
additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures and or to recover associated costs in the future may increase the company s costs and or decrease the demand for air travel  and may result in related adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
extensive government regulation could materially increase the company s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have adverse effects 
laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges  both domestically and internationally  have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 
the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations  or laws or regulations enacted in the future  will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
each of united and continental operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot 
if the dot altered  amended  modified  suspended or revoked these certificates  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the faa from time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company  and which could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design  manufacturing  maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action 
faa requirements cover  among other things  retirement of older aircraft  security measures  collision avoidance systems  airborne windshear avoidance systems  noise abatement and other environmental concerns  aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft 
these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents in addition  the company s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control atc system utilized by the us government 
during peak travel periods in certain markets  the current atc system s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to short term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic 
in addition  the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth 
imposition of these atc constraints on a long term basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
failure to update the atc system in a timely manner  and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the airline industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company s operations 
in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed  would increase the company s operating expenses 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
certain of the company s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 
the faa may limit the company s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports  which could affect the company s ownership and transfer rights  and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  in  the faa planned to withdraw and auction a certain number of slots held by airlines at the three primary new york area airports  which the airlines challenged and the faa terminated in if the faa were to plan another auction that survived legal challenge by the airlines  the company could incur substantial costs to obtain such slots 
further  the company s operating costs at airports at which it operates  including the company s major hubs  may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund  directly or indirectly 
in some circumstances  such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time  or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available 
the company currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers permitted to operate on the route  the capacity of the carriers providing services on the route  or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports 
if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes  such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets 
in addition  competition from revenue sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company s business and assets on the open skies routes 
the company s plans to enter into or expand antitrust immunized joint ventures for various international regions are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable federal authorities or otherwise satisfying applicable regulatory requirements  and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted or applicable regulatory requirements will be satisfied 
many aspects of the company s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company  including the eu ets subject to legal challenge  the state of california s cap 
table of contents and trade regulations  environmental taxes for certain international flights  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and land use planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in addition  there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry 
the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 
see item  business industry regulation  above  for further information on government regulation impacting the company 
the company s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 
due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months  revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
the company s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality  but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including  among others  the imposition of excise and similar taxes  extreme or severe weather  air traffic control congestion  geological events  natural disasters  changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
the company could experience adverse publicity  harm to its brand  reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident or other catastrophe involving its aircraft  the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners  which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
an accident or catastrophe involving an aircraft that the company operates  or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company s regional carriers  could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident created a public perception that the company s operations  or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers  are less safe or reliable than other airlines 
such public perception could in turn cause harm to the company s brand and reduce travel demand on the company s flights  or the flights or its codeshare partners or regional carriers 
in addition  any such accident could expose the company to significant tort liability 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident  and the company s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations  if the company s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it  the company could incur substantial losses from an accident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
ual s obligations for funding continental s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual s control 
continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees  other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia  inc the timing and amount of ual s funding requirements under continental s plans depend upon a number of factors  including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual s control  such as the number of applicable retiring employees  asset returns  interest rates and changes in pension laws 
changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual s funding requirements  such as its liquidity requirements  could have a material adverse effect on ual s financial condition 

table of contents the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or our long lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the company is required to test its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october of each year  or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
in addition  the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
during the years ended december   and  the company performed impairment tests of certain intangible assets and certain long lived assets principally aircraft  related spare engines and spare parts 
the interim impairment tests were due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred 
certain of the factors deemed by management to have indicated that impairments may have occurred include a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues  record high fuel prices  significant losses  a weak us economy  and changes in the planned use of assets 
as a result of the impairment testing  the company recorded significant impairment charges as described in note to the financial statements included in item the company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to  among other factors  extreme fuel price volatility  tight credit markets  a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets  unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and the uncertain economic environment  as well as other uncertainties 
the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period 
the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft 
such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
union disputes  employee strikes or slowdowns  and other labor related disruptions  as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger  present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies  increased labor costs or additional labor disputes that could adversely affect the company s operations and impair its financial performance 
united and continental are both highly unionized companies 
as of december   ual and its subsidiaries had approximately  active employees  of whom approximately were represented by various us labor organizations 
the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations 
failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies  increased labor costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 
in order to fully integrate the pre merger represented employee groups  the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group 
the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of each company s collective bargaining agreements and union policy 
pending operational integration  the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated 
under the mccaskill bond amendment  seniority integration must be accomplished in a fair and equitable manner consistent with the process set forth in the allegheny mohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies  if applicable 
employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list 
the national mediation board has exclusive authority to resolve representation disputes arising out of airline mergers 
following announcement of the merger  alpa  which represents pilots at both carriers  opted to pursue negotiations with the company for a joint collective bargaining agreement jcba that would govern the combined pilot group 
in july  united and continental reached agreement with alpa on a transition and process agreement that provides a framework for conducting pilot operations of the two groups until the parties 
table of contents reach agreement on a jcba and the carriers obtain a single operating certificate 
in august  united and continental began joint negotiations with alpa and the negotiations are presently ongoing 
the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable agreements will be achieved 
there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger 
there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slow downs  work to rule campaigns  sick outs or other actions designed to disrupt united s and continental s normal operations  in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations 
although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self help  and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature self help  such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined 
in  united obtained a preliminary injunction preventing united s pilots from engaging in any actions designed to disrupt united s normal operations 
as a result of an agreement between the parties  the preliminary injunction will remain in place until united and alpa have negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement 
increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks of september  led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines 
accordingly  the company s insurance costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain 
the company has obtained third party war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa  resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market 
should the government discontinue this coverage  obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms  if it is available at all 
if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance  its business could be materially and adversely affected 
if any of the company s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event  the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses  whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise  its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 
the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business  including computerized airline reservation systems  flight operations systems  telecommunication systems and commercial websites  including www 
united 
com and www 
continental 
com 
united s and continental s websites and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information  as well as process critical financial transactions 
these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events beyond the company s control  including natural disasters  power failures  terrorist attacks  equipment or software failures  computer viruses or hackers 
substantial or repeated website  reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of the company s services versus its competitors  materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights  and could result in increased costs  lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 
the company s business relies extensively on third party providers 
failure of these parties to perform as expected  or interruptions in the company s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has engaged an increasing number of third party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business  including regional operations  operation of customer service call 
table of contents centers  distribution and sale of airline seat inventory  provision of information technology infrastructure and services  provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs  provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations  among other vital functions and services 
the company does not directly control these third party providers  although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance 
any of these third party providers  however  may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated 
for example  flight reservations booked by customers and travel agents via third party gdss may be affected by changes to the contract terms between the company and gds operators 
a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when these contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation  which is scheduled to occur for some of these contracts later in  or other disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators  may cause the carriers flight information to be limited or unavailable for display  significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users  and impair the company s relationships with its customers and travel agents 
the failure of any of the company s third party service providers to adequately perform their service obligations  or other interruptions of services  may reduce the company s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers 
in addition  the company s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 
the company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances  including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 
as of december   ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section 
an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation s stock by more than percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding any potential ownership change 
as of october   ual corporation and continental each experienced an ownership change under section in connection with the merger 
while these merger related ownership changes are not expected to significantly limit the company s use of its nol carryforwards in the carryforward period  there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards 
potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company s convertible debt  repurchase of such debt with ual common stock  issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning or more of ual common stock  or a combination of such transactions  may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section under section  a future ownership change would subject the company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre ownership change nols that may be used to offset post ownership change taxable income 
this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may  subject to certain limits  be carried over to later years  and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change 
this limitation could cause the company s us federal income taxes to be greater  or to be paid earlier  than they otherwise would be  and could cause all or a portion of the company s nol carryforwards to expire unused 
similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods 
its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

table of contents ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 
to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a ownership limitation 
this limitation generally remains effective until february   or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the board of directors in its sole discretion 
the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns or more of ual common stock  unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 
any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred 
this provision of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock 
in addition  this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company  creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial  which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock 
the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock 
for additional information regarding the ownership limitation  please refer to ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company s website 
the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 
the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately one third of its operating revenues  as measured and reported to the dot 
the company s operations in asia  europe  latin america  africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network 
volatile economic  political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 
in addition  significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions  may have a material adverse impact upon the company s liquidity  revenues  costs and operating results 
the company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease  or similar public health threats  that affect travel behavior 
an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  avian flu or hn virus  or other illness  or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by similar public health threats in the future  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain provisions of ual s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 
certain provisions of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together  the governance documents may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 
certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 
these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover  but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual s stockholders interests 
while these provisions have the 
table of contents effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors  they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some  or a majority  of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
the issuance of ual s contingent senior notes could materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
ual would be obligated under an indenture to issue to the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc up to million aggregate principal amount of contingent senior notes the notes if certain financial triggering events occur 
the notes would be issued in up to eight equal tranches of million with each tranche issued no later than days following the end of any applicable fiscal year 
a triggering event occurs when ual s ebitdar as defined in the pbgc indenture exceeds billion over the prior twelve months ending june or december of any applicable fiscal year 
the twelve month measurement periods began with the fiscal year ended december  and will end with the fiscal year ending december  however  if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any other securities then existing  ual may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing ual common stock having a market value equal to million 
each issued tranche will mature years from its respective triggering event date  with interest payable in cash in semi annual installments  and will be callable  at ual s option  at any time at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
because continental s ebitdar will be included in the calculation for periods subsequent to the closing of the merger  the merger increases the likelihood that all or a portion of the notes will be issued  as well as the likelihood that the timing of any such issuances would be accelerated 
however  because the issuance of the notes is based upon future operating results  we cannot predict the exact number and timing of any such issuances by the company 
the issuance of the notes could adversely impact the company s results of operations because of increased charges to earnings for the principal amount of the notes issued and increased interest expense related to the notes 
issuance of such notes could also materially and adversely impact the company s liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments 
delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries may adversely affect the company s ability to expand its capacity 
the company from time to time acquires additional aircraft to increase its domestic and international capacity when the level of demand for air travel supports such growth 
the company has contractual commitments to purchase aircraft that it currently believes is necessary for its capacity growth 
delays in aircraft deliveries under those contractual commitments may occur and the company has been  and may in the future be  adversely impacted by those delays 
if significant additional delays in the deliveries of new aircraft occur  the company may be able to accomplish capacity increases only by making alternative arrangements to acquire the necessary aircraft  if available and possibly on less financially favorable terms  including higher ownership and operating costs 
the issuance of additional shares of ual s capital stock  including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes  could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock 
in certain circumstances  ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of ual s stockholders 
the board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  conversion rights  dividend rights  preferences over ual s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates  dissolves or winds up its business and other terms 
if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock  the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

table of contents ual is also authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  other securities convertible into either preferred stock or  in certain circumstances  common stock 
as of december   ual had billion of convertible debt outstanding 
holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual common stock according to their terms 
in addition  certain of ual s notes include noteholder early redemption options 
if a noteholder exercises such option  ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash  shares of its common stock or a combination thereof 
if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in shares of its common stock  ual is obligated to deliver a number of shares of common stock equal to the repurchase price divided by an average price of ual common stock for a consecutive trading day period 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this report for additional information related to these convertible notes 
the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 
in addition  if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash  its liquidity could be adversely affected 
in the future  ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock  securities convertible into ual common stock  or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock  including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt  could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders equity interests in ual 
issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock  or the perception that such issuances could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain foreign persons 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the total number of shares of equity securities held by persons who fail to qualify as a citizen of the united states  as defined in section a of title of the united states code  to no more than of the aggregate votes of all outstanding equity securities of ual

item legal proceedings 
air cargo passenger surcharge investigations in february  the european commission the commission and the united states department of justice the doj commenced an international investigation into what government officials described as a possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs for carrying air cargo 
the doj issued a grand jury subpoena to united and the commission conducted an inspection at the company s offices in frankfurt 
united is considered a source of information for the doj investigation  not a target 
on december   the commission issued a statement of objections to companies  including united 
the statement of objections presented evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and the exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal price fixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry 
after united provided written and oral responses disputing the commission s allegations against it  the commission dismissed united from its case on november  on july   state prosecutors in sao paulo  brazil  commenced criminal 
table of contents proceedings against eight individuals  including united s cargo manager  for allegedly participating in cartel activity 
united is actively participating in the defense of those allegations 
on january   the economic law secretariat of brazil issued its opinion recommending that civil penalties be assessed against all parties being investigated  including united  to the administrative counsel of economic defense cade  which will make a determination on the matter 
united will vigorously defend itself before the cade 
on december   the new zealand commerce commission issued notices of proceeding and statements of claim to airlines  including united 
united is vigorously defending these proceedings 
in addition to the government investigations  united was initially named as a defendant  along with other air cargo carriers  in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy 
those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the eastern district of new york on june  united entered into an agreement with the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs factual investigation 
united is no longer a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit 
united is currently cooperating with all ongoing investigations and continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result from any of the investigating bodies 
based on its evaluation of all information currently available  united has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities 
however  penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that united engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
united injunction against alpa and four individual defendants for unlawful slowdown activity under the railway labor act on july   united filed a lawsuit in the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois seeking a preliminary injunction against alpa and four individual pilot employees for unlawful concerted activity that was disrupting the company s operations 
the court granted the preliminary injunction to united in november  which was upheld by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
alpa and united reached an agreement to discontinue the ongoing litigation over united s motion for a permanent injunction and  instead  the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the conclusion of the ongoing bargaining process for an amended collective bargaining agreement that began on april  by reaching this agreement  the parties are able to focus their efforts on the negotiations for the collective bargaining agreement 
nothing in this agreement precludes either party from reopening the permanent injunction litigation upon a day notice or from seeking enforcement of the preliminary injunction itself 
eeoc claim under the americans with disabilities act on june   the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc filed a lawsuit on behalf of five named individuals and other similarly situated employees alleging that united s reasonable accommodation policy for employees with medical restrictions does not comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act 
the eeoc maintains that qualified disabled employees should be placed into available open positions for which they are minimally qualified  even if there are better qualified candidates for these positions 
under united s accommodation policy  employees who are medically restricted and who cannot be accommodated in their current position are given the opportunity to apply and compete for available positions 
if the medically restricted employee is similarly qualified to others who are competing for an open position  under united s policy  the medically restricted employee will be given a preference for the position 
if  however  there are candidates that have superior qualifications competing for an open position  then no preference will be given 
united successfully transferred the venue of the case to the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois where the case law is currently favorable to united s position 
on november   united filed a motion to dismiss the matter 
on february   the court granted united s motion to dismiss which may be appealed by the eeoc within days 

table of contents litigation associated with september  terrorism families of victims of the september terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry 
united and american airlines the aviation defendants  as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked  are the central focus of the litigation  but a variety of additional parties  including continental  have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers 
world trade center properties  inc  as lessee  also filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the port authority  the owner of the world trade center for property and business interruption damages 
the port authority has also filed cross claims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks 
the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center filed subrogation claims for damages as well 
by statute  these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and the aviation defendants exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks 
in the personal injury and wrongful death matters  the parties have settled all but one of the claims  in which settlement discussions continue  and for which a trial has been set in june insurers for the aviation defendants reached a settlement with all of the subrogated insurers and most of the uninsured plaintiffs with property and business interruption claims  which was approved by the court 
the court s approval order has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
the us district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a claim for environmental cleanup damages filed by a neighboring property owner  cedar washington associates  llc 
this dismissal order has also been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
in the aggregate  september th claims are estimated to be well in excess of billion 
the company anticipates that any liability it could ultimately face arising from the events of september  could be significant  but by statute will be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage 
travel agency litigation during the period between and  continental and united each independently reduced or capped the base commissions paid to domestic travel agents and soon thereafter eliminated those base commissions

table of contents litigation related to the merger transaction following continental and ual s announcement of the merger on may   three class action lawsuits were filed against continental  members of continental s board of directors and ual in the texas district court for harris county 
the lawsuits purported to represent a class of continental stockholders opposed to the terms of the merger agreement 
the lawsuits made virtually identical allegations that the consideration to be received by continental s stockholders in the merger was inadequate and that the members of continental s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  approving the merger at an inadequate price under circumstances involving certain conflicts of interest 
the lawsuits also made virtually identical allegations that ual and continental aided and abetted the continental board of directors in the breach of their fiduciary duties to continental s stockholders 
each lawsuit sought injunctive relief declaring that the merger agreement was in breach of the continental directors fiduciary duties  enjoining continental and ual from proceeding with the merger unless continental implements procedures to obtain the highest possible price for its stockholders  directing the continental board of directors to exercise its fiduciary duties in the best interest of continental s stockholders and rescinding the merger agreement 
on may   these three lawsuits were consolidated before a single judge 
on august   the parties reached an agreement in principle regarding settlement of the action 
under the terms of the settlement  the lawsuits will be dismissed with prejudice  releasing all defendants from any and all claims relating to  among other things  the merger and any disclosures made in connection therewith 
in exchange for that release  ual and continental provided additional disclosures requested by the plaintiffs in the action related to  among other things  the negotiations between continental and ual that resulted in the execution of the merger agreement  the method by which the exchange ratio was determined  the procedures used by ual s and continental s financial advisors in performing their financial analyses and certain investment banking fees paid to those advisors by ual and continental over the past two years 
the settlement will not affect any provision of the merger agreement or the form or amount of the consideration received by continental stockholders in the merger 
the defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing or liability with respect to all claims  events  and transactions complained of in the aforementioned actions or that they have engaged in any wrongdoing 
the defendants entered into the settlement to eliminate the uncertainty  burden  risk  expense  and distraction of further litigation 
on february   the court entered final judgment and dismissed the case 
on june   forty nine purported purchasers of airline tickets filed an antitrust lawsuit in the us district court for the northern district of california against continental and ual in connection with the merger

on august   the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction pursuant to section of the clayton act  seeking to enjoin the merger

additionally  from time to time  the company becomes aware of potential non compliance with applicable environmental regulations  which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity 
in some instances  these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions 
after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

outlook set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and or from our anticipated results of operations described in our forward looking statements in this report 
see item a  risk factors  for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 
economic conditions 
the severe global economic recession significantly diminished the demand for air travel resulting in a difficult financial environment for us network carriers in and ual s financial performance improved significantly in primarily as a result of improving global economic conditions 
although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery  including strengthening demand and improving revenue  we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement 
worsening economic conditions resulting in diminished demand for air travel may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in merger integration 
ual expects the merger to deliver billion to billion in net annual synergies on a run rate basis by  including between million and million of incremental annual revenues  in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network  fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by a broader combined network 
ual expects to realize between million and million of net cost synergies on a run rate basis by in addition  ual expects that approximately of its gross synergies will be realized in the company also expects to incur a significant amount of additional substantial merger related expenses and charges 
there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and charges  and many of the expenses and charges that will be incurred are  by their nature  uncertain and difficult to estimate accurately 
see note and note to the financial statements in item and item a  risk factors  for additional information 

table of contents since the closing of the merger  the company has taken significant steps toward the operational integration of united and continental 
the company has begun to optimize the gauge and frequency of its fleet in order to meet travel demand and capitalize on its combined global network efficiently 
the introduction of new services to markets previously not served by either carrier allows the company to meet the passenger demand created through the larger  more comprehensive network 
the company is also aligning revenue management and pricing systems  as well as inventory management strategies  allowing it to create new revenue opportunities and other efficiencies for the combined company 
in addition  the company has begun to align its employee incentive programs  including its on time bonus  perfect attendance and profit sharing programs 
during and into  the company expects to continue to harmonize into the new united brand the products and services offered by its two carriers 
the harmonization will involve streamlined customer policies  aligned check in and boarding procedures  migration to a single reservations system  and linkage of loyalty program accounts until the introduction of a combined loyalty program for  among other events 
the company continues to integrate its operations and  by the end of the second quarter of  expects to be co located at more than airports  including all of its hubs 
by the end of  the company expects to receive a single operating certificate for united and continental from the faa 
the company has begun the transition to selected information technology platforms that support its commercial and operational processes  which is expected to take more than one year to complete 
fuel costs 
fuel costs were less volatile in as compared to recent years  however  prices increased significantly late in and in the first two months of ual s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes and excluding hedge impact was in as compared to in if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels  we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs 
in addition  high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in based on projected fuel consumption in  a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual s annual fuel expense by approximately million  assuming there are no changes to the crude oil to aircraft fuel refining margins and no impact from our fuel hedging program 
to protect against increases in the prices of fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements  provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective 
see note to the financial statements in item for additional details regarding the company s hedging activities 
additional revenue generating and cost saving measures 
we intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel  a portion of which will come from the unbundling of our current product and a portion of which will come from future goods and services that we do not presently offer 
the revenues that we derive from these products and services  which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues  typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in the unbundling of our current products and services permits our customers flexibility in selecting the products and services they wish to purchase 
an example of a new service that we have introduced is continental s farelock  introduced in december  which is an option that offers customers the opportunity  for a fee  to hold reservations and lock in ticket prices for either hours or seven days with no commitment to purchase a ticket 
additionally  we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with self service and allow us to make better operational decisions  while lowering our operating costs 
capacity 
we announced new service to several international destinations in  including lagos  nigeria  cairo  egypt and auckland  new zealand 
we do not anticipate significant capacity growth in unless the level of demand for air travel  economic conditions and the expected financial benefit sufficiently justify such growth 
we expect only modest capacity growth for  with both our mainline and consolidated capacity increasing between and 
we expect consolidated domestic capacity to decrease between and and consolidated international capacity to increase between and 
should fuel prices increase significantly  we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward 

table of contents our future ability to grow or improve our efficiency could be adversely impacted by manufacturer delays in aircraft deliveries 
we have not received a revised delivery schedule  but we currently expect the first of our boeing aircraft to be delivered in the first half of labor costs 
our ability to achieve and sustain profitability also depends on continuing our efforts to implement and maintain a more competitive cost structure 
as of december   united and continental had approximately and  respectively  of employees represented by unions 
all of united s union represented employees and of continental s union represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are currently amendable 
we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups 
the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups  although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the company

consistent with the rest of the airline industry  ual s decline in prasm was partially driven by a precipitous decline in worldwide travel demand as a result of the severe global recession 
two key factors had a distinct impact on ual s revenue during first  network composition played a role in overall unit revenue decline 
international markets  in particular the pacific region  experienced more significant unit revenue declines as compared to the other regions 
given ual s significant international network and its historic relative contribution to passenger revenue  ual s revenue was significantly impacted by the contraction in travel demand in the pacific 
second  while demand generally declined across all geographic regions  premium and business demand declined more significantly than leisure demand 
as ual s business model is strongly aligned to serve premium and business travelers  both internationally and domestically  the decrease in travel by business travelers and the buy down from premium class to economy class by some business travelers caused a significant negative impact on ual s results in in  consolidated yield decreased as compared to  while consolidated average fare per passenger decreased in the same period 
the yield and average fare decreases were primarily a result of the weak economic environment in and the resulting adverse economic impacts on ual  as discussed above 
consolidated revenue was also negatively impacted by lower volumes of traffic due to the effects of the severe global recession 
consolidated revenues were favorably impacted in by an adjustment of approximately million related to certain tax accruals that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenue 
this adjustment was recorded as a result of new information received by ual related to these tax matters 
cargo revenue declined by million  or  in as compared to  due to four key factors 
first  united took significant steps to rationalize its capacity  with reduced international capacity affecting a number of key cargo markets 
second  as noted by industry statistical releases during  virtually all carriers in the industry  including united  were sharply impacted by reduced air freight and mail volumes driven by lower recessionary demand  with the resulting oversupply of cargo capacity putting pressure on industry pricing in nearly all markets 
some of the largest industry demand reductions occurred in the pacific cargo market  where united has a greater cargo capacity as compared to the atlantic  latin and domestic cargo markets 
third  lower fuel costs in also reduced cargo revenue through lower fuel surcharges on cargo shipments as compared to when historically high fuel prices occurred 
finally  united  historically one of the largest carriers of us international mail  was impacted by lower mail volumes and pricing beginning in third quarter of arising from us international mail deregulation 
the deregulation moved pricing from regulated rates set by the dot to market based pricing as a result of a competitive bidding process 

table of contents in  the increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in ancillary passenger related revenues  which includes baggage fees and other unbundled services 
for the full year of  ancillary passenger related revenues totaled approximately billion

asset impairments the aircraft impairments in and are primarily related to a decrease in the estimated market value of ual s nonoperating boeing and aircraft 
in  ual recorded a million impairment million net of taxes of its indefinite lived brazil routes due to an estimated decrease in the value of these routes as a result of the new open skies agreement 
during  ual determined it overstated its deferred tax liabilities by approximately million when it applied fresh start accounting upon its exit from bankruptcy in under applicable standards in  this error would have been corrected with a decrease to goodwill  which would have resulted in a decrease in the amount of ual s goodwill impairment charge 
therefore  ual corrected this overstatement in the fourth quarter of by reducing its deferred tax liabilities and recorded it as a goodwill impairment credit in its 
table of contents consolidated statement of operations 
the adjustment was not made to prior periods as ual does not believe the correction is material to the current or any prior period 
in  ual recorded a million intangible asset impairment million net of taxes to decrease the value of united s tradename  which was primarily due to a decrease in estimated future revenues resulting from the weak economic environment and united s capacity reductions  among other factors 
in  ual recorded special charges of million related to the final settlement of the lax municipal bond litigation and million primarily related to boeing aircraft lease terminations 
during the fourth quarter of  ual recorded million to other operating expense  million each for united and continental  due to revenue sharing obligations related to the trans atlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada

prior to april   ual did not designate any of its fuel hedge contracts under applicable accounting standards 
therefore  ual marked to market changes in the fair value of its contracts through fuel expense in the case of economic hedges and through nonoperating expense in the case of hedges that were not considered to be economic hedges 
the majority of the combined billion of fuel hedge losses in was due to mark to market losses on open fuel hedge contracts at december  these contracts cash settled in these significant losses occurred because certain ual hedge instruments required payments by ual to the counterparty if fuel prices fell below specified floors or strike prices in the hedge contracts 
crude oil peaked at approximately per barrel in july and subsequently fell to around per barrel in december the hedge contract prices at which ual was required to make payments to its counterparties were well above per barrel  resulting in significant losses on the hedge contracts

landing fees and other rent increased million  or  in as compared to primarily due to higher rates 
during  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased by million  or  as compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of engine and airframe maintenance repairs as a result of united s early retirement of aircraft from its operating fleet and the timing of maintenance on other fleet types 
distribution expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to primarily due to lower passenger revenues on lower traffic and yields driving reductions in commissions  credit card fees and gds fees 
ual also implemented several operating cost savings programs for both commissions and gds fees which produced realized savings in aircraft rent expense decreased by million  or  in as compared to primarily as a result of ual s retirement of its entire fleet of boeing aircraft  some of which were financed through operating leases 
ual s other operating expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower variable costs associated with a decrease in mainline capacity 
in addition  other operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in maintenance cost of sales  which was due to lower sales of engine maintenance services 
asset impairments and special charges

table of contents nonoperating expenses decreased by million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a million improvement in net fuel hedge gains and losses  partially offset by a million decrease in interest income due to lower investment yields as a result of decreased market rates 
as described in the discussion of changes in aircraft fuel expense above  prior to april   ual did not designate any of its fuel hedges as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards 
ual had a significant amount of hedges that it did not consider economic hedges and classified the related hedge losses in miscellaneous nonoperating expense 
as noted above  the significant losses in were due to significant fuel price declines below the contractual prices in ual s fuel hedge portfolio that existed during and at the end of the company s fuel derivative gain in was less significant compared to because the company did not have any significant derivative activity for hedges that are classified in miscellaneous  net  in  other than settlement of contracts that existed at december   and there was less fuel price volatility in as compared to see note to the financial statements in item for further information related to fuel hedges 
income taxes 
in  ual recorded a tax benefit of million related to the impairment of its brazil routes  offset by million of state and other income tax expense 
the tax benefits recorded in and are related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinite lived intangible assets  partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates 
excluding these items  the effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the following change in valuation allowance  expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and state income taxes 
ual is required to provide a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because management has concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets ultimately will not be realized

see note to the financial statements in item for additional details regarding merger related costs and special charges  and other operating expenses included a million payment due to the revenue sharing obligations related to the trans atlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada 
united s nonoperating expense increased million  or  in as compared to  which was primarily due to the increased cost of debt financing as a result of distressed capital markets during and 
table of contents united s interest expense is consistent with ual s interest expense  excluding the merger impact discussed above  except for approximately million of interest expense in from ual s million of senior convertible notes due that were not issued by united 
continental the table below presents the continental successor and predecessor periods in the combined presentation for the year ended december  does not represent a gaap presentation 
management believes that the combined non gaap results provide a more meaningful comparison to the full year continental s operating income and net income in the combined period were million and million  respectively  as compared to operating and net losses of million and million  respectively  in this improvement was largely due to the improvement in global economic conditions following the severe recession in  consistent with the improvement in ual s results described above

in the combined period  aircraft fuel expense increased as compared to primarily due to an increase in fuel prices 
fuel hedge losses were million and million in and  respectively 
continental s fuel purchase cost  without hedge impacts  increased approximately in as compared to  which is relatively consistent with ual s unhedged cost of fuel summarized in the tables above 
salaries and related costs increased in the combined period as compared to the significant factors contributing to the increase in were profit sharing and related taxes of million  variable incentive compensation and annual employee wage increases 

table of contents aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased in the combined period as compared to primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and savings from renegotiated rates on certain contracts 
continental s depreciation and amortization expense increased in the combined period as compared to primarily due to increased expense in the successor period associated with recording continental s assets at fair value as of the merger closing date 
distribution expenses increased in the combined period as compared to  which was primarily due to increases in ticket volumes and prices  as some distribution expenses are price based and some are volume based 
aircraft rent decreased in the combined period as compared to primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  continental recorded million to other operating expense due to the revenue sharing obligations related to the trans atlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada for the first three quarters of merger related costs and special charges in the combined period included million of merger related expenses due to costs associated with the merger and integration of united and continental  as discussed above 
aircraft related charges of million in included million of non cash impairments on boeing and aircraft and related assets  million of other aircraft related charges and million of losses related to subleasing regional jets 
see note to the financial statements in item for additional discussion of merger related costs and special charges 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   ual had billion in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which is billion higher than at december  primarily due to the merger impact 
at december   ual also had million of restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which is primarily collateral for estimated future workers compensation claims  credit card processing contracts  letters of credit and performance bonds 
we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future 
restricted cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million 
united has a million revolving commitment under its amended credit facility  maturing in february  of which million and million had been used for letters of credit as of december  and  respectively 
unless this facility is renewed or replaced  these letters of credit will likely be replaced with cash collateral 
in addition  under a separate agreement  united had a million unused line of credit as of december  as is the case with many of our principal competitors  we have a high proportion of debt compared to our capital 
we have a significant amount of fixed obligations  including debt  aircraft leases and financings  leases of airport property and other facilities and postretirement medical and pension obligations 
at december   ual had approximately billion of debt and capital lease obligations 
in addition  we have substantial non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures  including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 
as of december  a substantial portion of the company s assets  principally aircraft  spare engines  aircraft spare parts  route authorities and certain other intangible assets were pledged under various loan and other agreements 
see note to the financial statements in item for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company 
the company has limited undrawn lines of credit and most of our otherwise readily financeable assets are encumbered 
the global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital 
table of contents markets  resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable 
although access to the capital markets has improved  as evidenced by our recent financing transactions  we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
we must sustain our profitability and or access the capital markets to meet our significant long term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures  including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines 
the following is a discussion of ual s sources and uses of cash from to as ual applied the acquisition method of accounting to the merger  ual s cash activities discussed below include continental activities only after october  cash flows from operating activities 
compared to ual s cash from operating activities increased by million in  as compared to this year over year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services 
higher cash operating expenses  including fuel  distribution costs and interest expense  partially offset the benefit from increased revenues 
net cash required for fuel increased in the period due to higher aircraft fuel prices  as shown in the fuel expense table in results of operations operating expenses compared to  above 
operating cash flows in the period included the receipt of million related to the future relocation of ual s chicago o hare cargo facility 
compared to ual s cash from operating activities increased by billion in as compared to this improvement was partly due to decreased cash required for aircraft fuel purchases as consolidated fuel purchase costs decreased by billion in as compared to decreases in ual s fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately million in  as compared to a use of cash of million in in addition  ual received million during related to the future relocation of its chicago o hare cargo facility 
these operating cash flow benefits were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to decreased revenues  which decreased by billion in in addition  ual did not have a significant advance sale of miles in resulting in an unfavorable variance as compared to  during which ual received million from its advanced sale of miles and license agreement with its co branded credit card partner  as discussed below

downgrades from these rating levels  among other things  could restrict the availability and or increase the cost of future financing for the company 
other liquidity matters below is a summary of additional liquidity matters 
see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

table of contents long term debt and related covenants note operating leases note investment in student loan related auction rate securities note fuel hedges note pension and other postretirement benefit obligations note regional capacity purchase agreements note guarantees and indemnifications  credit card processing agreements  and environmental liabilities note debt covenants 
certain of the company s financing agreements impose certain operating and financial covenants  as applicable  on the company  on united and its material subsidiaries  or on continental and its subsidiaries 
among other covenants  the amended credit facility requires ual  united and certain of united s material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the amended credit facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined in the amended credit facility of billion at all times  a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter 
among other covenants  the indentures governing the senior notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations 
if the value of the collateral underlying that issuer s senior notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations  the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of per annum  provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders lien or repay a portion of the senior notes 
a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility or indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations 
in addition  the indentures governing the united senior notes contain a cross acceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility would result in a default under such indentures 
a default under the indentures governing the united senior notes could allow holders of the united senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the obligations in these agreements 
credit card processing agreements 
united and continental have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services 
under certain of united s and continental s credit card processing agreements  the financial institutions either require  or under certain circumstances have the right to require  that united and continental maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution  but for which united and continental have not yet provided the air transportation 
as of december   united and continental provided a reserve of million each  as required under their respective credit card processing agreements with jpmorgan chase and affiliates of jpmorgan chase 
additional reserves may be required under these or other credit card processing agreements of united or continental in certain circumstances  such as decreases in credit ratings  decreases in united s or continental s unrestricted cash balance below amounts required by the processing agreements  or decreases in minimum ratios of unrestricted cash to current liabilities 
in addition  in certain circumstances  an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of one or more of united s and continental s material credit card processing agreements could materially reduce the company s liquidity 
see note to the financial statements in item for a detailed discussion of the obligations under the company s credit card processing agreements 
capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s business is capital intensive  requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets  particularly aircraft 
in the past  the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase  by issuing debt  by entering into capital or operating leases  or through vendor financings 
the company also often enters into long term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal  cargo  maintenance and other required facilities

contingencies 
contingent senior unsecured notes 
ual would be obligated under an indenture to issue to the pbgc up to million aggregate principal amount of notes if certain financial triggering events occur 
the notes would be issued to the pbgc in up to eight equal tranches of million with each tranche issued no later than days following the end of any applicable year 
a triggering event occurs when ual s ebitdar as defined in the pbgc indenture exceeds billion over the prior twelve months ending june or december of any applicable fiscal year 
the twelve month measurement periods will end with the fiscal year ending december  in certain circumstances  ual common stock may be issued in lieu of the issuance of the notes 
a financial triggering event has not yet occurred under this indenture 

table of contents legal and environmental 
the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the information currently available  the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term  based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 
many aspects of the company s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad  could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the eu emissions trading scheme ets which is subject to legal challenge  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center and co located cogeneration plant 
in addition  there are land based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in  the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets  which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january  beginning in  the ets would require the company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from eu member states with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government 
in december  the air transportation association  joined by united  continental and american airlines  filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers 
in addition  non eu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations international civil aviation organization icao with respect to the eu s inclusion of non eu carriers 
if the scheme is found to be valid  it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits  although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables 
those potential costs will depend  among other things  on the baseline carbon emissions yet to be determined by the eu  the company s future carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu  and the price of carbon credits 
in addition to current regulatory programs  there is also the potential for additional climate change regulation 
in  the administrator of the us environmental protection agency epa found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare 
although legal challenges have been initiated and legislative proposals are expected that may invalidate this endangerment finding and or the epa s assertion of authority under the clean air act  the finding could result in epa regulation of commercial aircraft emissions 
in addition  the icao recently signaled through an icao assembly resolution that it will be developing a regulatory scheme for aviation greenhouse gas emissions 
there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government  state governments within the us  foreign governments  or through a separate united nations global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry  which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions 
the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant  including the potential for increased fuel costs  carbon taxes or fees  or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 
the company believes that it will have no financial exposure for claims arising out of the events of september  in light of the provisions of the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 
table of contents  the resolution of the majority of the wrongful death and personal injury cases by settlement and the withdrawal of all related proofs of claim from ual corporation s chapter bankruptcy protection  and the limitation of claimants recoveries to insurance proceeds 
other contingencies 
united is a party to a multiyear technology services agreement and has engaged in discussions with the counterparty to amend or restructure certain performance obligations 
in the event that these discussions are not successful  the counterparty may assert claims for damages 
the ultimate outcome of these discussions and the exact amount of the damages and costs  if any  to the company cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
for further details on these and other matters  see note in item off balance sheet arrangements 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements 
the company s primary off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases  which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above  and certain municipal bond obligations  as discussed below 
in addition  united has million of letters of credit issued under its amended credit facility at december  continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate  customs and aircraft financing obligations at december  in the amount of million 
the continental letters of credit and performance bonds have expiration dates through december certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of each of united and continental to finance the construction of improvements at airport related facilities 
united and continental also each lease facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport related projects 
as of december   united guaranteed interest and principal payments of million in principal amount of denver international airport bonds denver bonds which are due in  unless united elects not to extend its equipment and ground lease in which case the bonds are due in the outstanding bonds and related guarantee for denver are not recorded in united s financial statements because the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straight line basis over the expected lease term through the annual lease payments through and the final payment for the principal amount of the denver bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above 
as of december   continental is the guarantor of approximately billion in aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon  excluding the us airways contingent liability described below 
these bonds  issued by various airport municipalities  are payable solely from continental s rentals paid under long term agreements with the respective governing bodies 
the leasing arrangements associated with approximately billion of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases  and the leasing arrangements associated with approximately million of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases 
continental is contingently liable for us airways obligations under a lease agreement between us airways and the port authority of new york and new jersey related to the east end terminal at laguardia 
these obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the port authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the port authority having an outstanding par amount of million at december  and a final scheduled maturity in if us airways defaults on these obligations  continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after us airways interest in the lease had been terminated 

table of contents increased cost provisions 
in the company s financing transactions that include loans  the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and  in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor  for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law  subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders 
at december   ual had billion of floating rate debt consisting of united s billion and continental s billion of floating rate debt and million of fixed rate debt consisting of united s million and continental s million of fixed rate debt  with remaining terms of up to ten years  that are subject to these increased cost provisions 
in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non us entities  with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate carrying value of billion consisting of united s billion and continental s billion of carrying value  we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non us entities to withholding taxes  subject to customary exclusions 
fuel consortia 
the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage 
interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage 
the consortia and in limited cases  the participating carriers have entered into long term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax exempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds  issued by various local municipalities 
in general  each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds 
as of december   approximately billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates  as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt 
ual s contingent exposure is approximately million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation 
as of december   united s and continental s contingent exposure related to these bonds  based on its recent consortia participation  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases 
the guarantees will expire when the tax exempt bonds are paid in full  which range from to the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 
united and continental cash flow activities compared to united operating activities united s cash from operating activities increased by million in  as compared to this year over year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services 
higher cash operating expenses  including fuel  distribution costs and interest expense  partially offset the benefit from increased revenues 
net cash required for fuel increased in the period due to higher aircraft fuel prices 
operating cash flows in the period included the receipt of million related to the future relocation of ual s chicago o hare cargo facility 
investing activities united s capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
united limited its spending in both and by focusing its capital resources only on its highest value projects 
in  united received million from three sale leaseback agreements 
these transactions were accounted for as capital leases  resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during financing activities united s significant financing activities in and are described in cash flows from financing activities  above  in this item 
table of contents continental operating activities continental s cash from operating activities increased by billion in the combined period  as compared to this year over year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services 
higher cash operating expenses  including fuel and distribution costs  partially offset the benefit from increased revenues

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions 
the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
actual results could differ 
table of contents from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 
passenger revenue recognition 
the value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders mcos is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales 
the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united and continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage 
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage at departure date 
the company records an estimate of tickets that have been used  but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors  as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results 
due to complex industry pricing structures  refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines  certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized 
these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 
tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines 
non refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected 
change fees related to non refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company s additional service to modify a previous sale 
therefore  the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 
refundable tickets expire after one year 
mcos can be exchanged for a passenger ticket 
the company estimates the amount of mco breakage revenue based on historical experience 
see note to the financial statements in item for additional information related to accounting standards impacting revenue recognition that have been issued  but not yet adopted by the company 
frequent flyer awards 
united and continental have loyalty programs to increase customer loyalty 
program participants earn mileage credits miles by flying on united  continental and certain other participating airlines 
program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non airline partners that participate in the company s loyalty programs 
we sell miles to these partners  which include retail merchants  credit card issuers  hotels and car rental companies  among others 
miles can be redeemed for free  discounted or upgraded air travel and non travel awards 
the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 
in the case of the sale of air services  the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale that represents the fair value of the miles  as described further below 
in the case of miles sold to third parties there are two revenue elements marketing and air transportation  as described below 
marketing related element 
in addition to selling miles for future redemption  the company may also provide marketing services with the sale of miles  which  depending on the particular customer  may include advertising and branding services  access to the program member list and other services 
the amount of revenue from the marketing related element is determined by subtracting the estimated fair value of the miles earned or future transportation element from the total proceeds 
the residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recorded as other operating revenue when earned 
air transportation element 
the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided 
the fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar company fares and amounts paid to other airlines for air transportation 
the initial revenue deferral is recorded as frequent flyer deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
the revenue related to the air transportation component is recorded as passenger revenue 

table of contents the value of miles is estimated assuming redemptions on the company and other participating carriers in the loyalty programs and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the company s operations 
this estimate also includes the cost of redemption on other airlines and the cost of certain other awards 
the estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions  for which significant management judgment is required 
for example  management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on its airline  versus on other airlines 
since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on the company and on other carriers can vary greatly  this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weighted average ticket value from period to period 
management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates  but changes in customer redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior may result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue 
the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles  regardless of whether the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award 
some of these sold and awarded miles will never be redeemed by program members  which we refer to as breakage 
ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns 
prior to january   ual and united recognized revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period 
the company s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment 
current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 
for example  various program rule differences exist between the united and continental programs 
one such difference is for the expiration of miles  as under united s program miles expire after eighteen months of inactivity  whereas miles do not expire under continental s program 
although continental s program does not cancel accounts for inactivity  continental records breakage revenue by estimating that a portion of the miles will never be redeemed based on statistical analysis of several years of sales and redemptions of miles 
during the first quarter of  united obtained additional historical data  previously unavailable  which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles 
this new data enables united to identify historical differences between certain of its breakage estimates and the amounts that have actually been experienced more accurately 
as a result  united increased its estimate of the number of miles expected to expire 
in conjunction with this change in estimate  united also adopted a change to the accounting methodology used to recognize breakage 
both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective january  the new accounting method recognizes breakage as a component of the weighted average redemption rate on actual redemptions as compared to united s prior method which recognized a pool of breakage dollars over an estimated redemption period 
united believes that this is a preferable change to the accounting methodology for breakage because breakage will be recognized as a component of the rate at which actual miles are redeemed 
ual and united estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately million  or per ual basic share per ual diluted share  in the year ended december  the following table summarizes information related to the company s frequent flyer deferred revenue ual united continental frequent flyer deferred revenue at december  in millions of miles earned expected to expire or go unredeemed impact of change in outstanding miles or weighted average ticket value on deferred revenue in millions 
table of contents asset impairments 
during  and  ual performed interim and annual impairment tests of its intangible assets  including goodwill and certain of its long lived assets  principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts 
ual tested its indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill  on an annual basis 
in addition  ual performed additional tests due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred 
certain factors deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event were a significant decline in actual and forecasted revenues  the planned removal from ual s fleet of aircraft  and a significant decrease in the fair value of ual s outstanding equity and debt securities  including a decline in ual s market capitalization to significantly below book value  among others 
ual recorded impairment charges of million  million and billion during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the impairment charge in included a billion goodwill impairment 
discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment aircraft asset impairments all of ual s aircraft impairments during  and were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded or aircraft that were not operated by ual 
the aircraft impairments primarily related to united s boeing fleet  which it completely removed from service  and five of its boeing aircraft  which it removed from service as part of united s capacity reduction plans  which were initiated in fair value was estimated using the market approach 
asset appraisals  published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by united in its market value determination 
several impairments of the boeing and aircraft occurred from to due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft  among other factors 
in addition to the boeing and aircraft  in  ual tested five of its owned regional jets  which were leased to a third party  for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of approximately one year 
as a result of this testing  ual recorded impairment charges of million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of december  due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above  ual also determined in that it was required to perform an impairment test of its million of pre delivery aircraft deposits and related capitalized interest 
ual determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full carrying value as ual believed that it was highly unlikely that it would take these future aircraft deliveries and  therefore  united would be required to forfeit the deposits  which were not transferable based on existing contract terms 
indefinite lived intangible assets ual performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite lived intangible assets on october of each year and performs interim impairment tests of these assets throughout the year if events and changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might have occurred 
in  ual recorded a million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the recent open skies agreement between the us and brazil which  once enacted  may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes 
the valuation of the brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes 

table of contents in  using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows  united recorded impairment charges of million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename 
the most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to the poor global economic conditions 
in  ual recorded a million impairment charge to indefinite lived intangible assets primarily codeshare agreements 
in  ual estimated the fair value of the mainline reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated utilizing several fair value measurement techniques  including two market estimates and one income estimate  and using relevant data available 
the market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets 
the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets 
the income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life  including residual value cash flows 
these cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money 
under the market approaches  the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for ual  as well as a separate comparison to revenue and ebitdar multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry 
the fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions 
under the income approach  the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for ual 
the income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity  passenger yield  traffic  operating costs including fuel prices  appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions 
the company estimated its future fuel related cash flows for the income approach based on the five year forward curve for crude oil as of may  the impacts of the company s aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation of the mainline reporting unit 
taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate  which has been ual s practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests  the indicated fair value of the mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value  and therefore  ual was required to perform additional goodwill impairment testing 
for this testing  ual determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline reporting unit  including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  as if the mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price 
as a result of this testing  ual determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge to write off the full value of goodwill 
accounting for long lived assets 
the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections  including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and  when necessary  the recognition of asset impairment charges 
the company records assets acquired  including aircraft  at acquisition cost 
depreciable life is determined through economic analysis  such as reviewing existing fleet plans  obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets 
older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and continental and the practice of other airlines 
as aircraft technology has improved  useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 
table of contents years 
residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets 
residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life 
both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the company s fleet plan and other relevant information 
a one year increase in the average depreciable life of ual s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately million 
benefit accounting 
united s obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans were substantially eliminated in as most of the united defined benefit plans were assumed by the pbgc as part of ual corporation s emergence from chapter bankruptcy protection 
ual s pension obligations increased significantly in due to ual s assumption of continental obligations in the merger 
under applicable accounting guidance  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
ual only began recognizing the impact of continental s plans in its financial statements beginning on october  ual s plans under funded status was billion at december   of which billion is attributed to continental s plans 
funding requirements for tax qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations 
we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during calendar year is approximately million 
the fair value of the plans assets was billion at december   of which billion is attributed to assets of continental s plans 
the following discussion relates only to the continental plans  as the united plans are not significant to ual s total obligations 
when calculating pension expense for  continental assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 
the expected long term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
our projected long term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets  and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets 
the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the defined benefit pension plans assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities held through common collective trusts 
equity securities include investments in large cap and small cap companies 
fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies in diversified industries and asset and mortgage backed securities 
investments in equity securities and fixed income securities are commingled funds valued at the unit of participation value of shares held by the plans trusts 
the private equity funds invest primarily in common stock of companies in diversified industries and in buyout  venture capital and special situation funds 
investments in private equity funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plans trusts at year end 
the allocation of assets was as follows at december  percent of total expected long term rate of return equity security funds us companies international companies fixed income securities private equity funds 
table of contents pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
when calculating pension expense for  we will assume that our plans assets will generate a weighted average long term rate of return of 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by an additional basis points from to would increase ual s estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of at december  ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
this approach can result in different discount rates for different plans  depending on each plan s projected benefit payments 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by basis points from to would increase the pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  plan provisions  assumed discount rates  pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
other postretirement benefit accounting 
united s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits  primarily in the us  to retirees and eligible dependents  as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits 
continental s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility 
eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits  which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement 
plan benefits are subject to co payments  deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations  or the plan s funded status  in its financial statements 
under gaap  other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements 
the company has not been required to pre fund its current and future plan obligations  which has resulted in a significant net obligation  as discussed below 
ual s benefit obligation was billion and billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase is due to continental plan obligations assumed by ual in the merger  as well as changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for united s plan  such as the decrease in the discount rate 
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions  including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
ual s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december  was  as compared to for december  the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for was and  respectively  as compared to assumed trend rates for of and  respectively 
a increase decrease in assumed health care trend rates would increase decrease ual s total service and interest cost for the year ended december  by million million  respectively 
detailed information regarding the company s other postretirement plans  including key assumptions  is included in note to the financial statements in item of this report 
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions 
under the applicable accounting standards  those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive 
table of contents income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees 
the company s accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable gaap with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the corridor approach  amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if  at the beginning of the year  the accumulated gain or loss exceeds of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets 
if amortization is required  the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense 
the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year 
since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach  all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees 
at december  and  ual had unrecognized actuarial gains of million and million  respectively  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans 
business combination measurements 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  ual estimated the fair value of continental s assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the merger  october  these fair value measurements did not result in gains or losses  but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from continental in the merger 
additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values  as well as changes in other assumptions  could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market  income and cost approaches 
the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market other than for derivative financial instruments and certain long term debt assumed in the merger 
the market approach  which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets  was utilized to estimate the fair value of continental s aircraft and operating leases 
the market approach used by the company included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets  as well as pricing guides and other sources 
we considered the current market for the aircraft  the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets  among other factors 
we also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available 
the income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets  including the frequent flyer database  international route authorities  alliances  the continental logo and tradename  and certain airport take off and landing slots 
the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset 
projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
the cost approach  which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility  was used  as appropriate  for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset 
the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation 
the fair value of continental s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the merger closing date 
any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability 
one of the significant assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation is the discount rate 
we determined the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due  which resulted in a discount rate of for pension plans and for postretirement plans 
other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate  retirement age  and mortality assumptions 
these assumptions are discussed further in note to the financial statements in item 
table of contents the fair value of continental s onepass frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles at october  that were expected to be redeemed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short term investments 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements  depending upon market conditions 
the following table summarizes information related to the company s interest rate market risk at december  in millions ual a united a continental variable rate debt carrying value of variable rate debt at december  b impact of basis point increase on projected interest expense c fixed rate debt carrying value of fixed rate debt at december  d fair value of fixed rate debt at december  e impact of basis point increase in market rates on fair value f a ual and united presented interest rate market risk disclosures in a tabular format in management believes that the sensitivity analysis presentation provides a better disclosure by quantifying the potential impact of an assumed interest rate change 
due to this change  ual and united are also disclosing sensitivity analysis for their debt outstanding at december  b as of december   ual  united and continental had outstanding variable rate debt of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
c based on ual s and united s variable rate debt at december   the impact of an assumed basis point change for ual and united on interest expense would have been million 
d as of december   ual  united and continental had outstanding fixed rate debt with a carrying value of billion  billion and billion  respectively

f if market interest rates increased basis points at december   the fair value of ual and united fixed rate debt outstanding at december   would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
assuming our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments remain at their average levels  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in ual  united and continental interest income of approximately million  million and million  respectively  during commodity price risk aircraft fuel 
our results of operations and liquidity are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements  provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective 
the company uses fixed price swaps  purchased call options  collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments 
these hedge instruments are based directly on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil and crude oil 
the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure consistent with industry standards so that the company s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 
some hedge instruments may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors or swap prices 
however  the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements  and uses swaps or sold puts as a part of a collar on only a portion of the fuel requirement that it does hedge 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for non risk management purposes

table of contents foreign currency 
the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
some of the company s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  japanese yen  british pound and the european euro 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for non risk management purposes 
at december  and  united did not have any foreign currency hedges 
at december   continental had forward contracts outstanding to hedge of its projected japanese yen denominated cash inflows  primarily from passenger ticket sales  through at december   the fair value of those hedges was million and is included in other current liabilities in continental s consolidated balance sheets 
continental estimates that a uniform strengthening of in the value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen at december  would increase the fair value of its yen hedges by million and increase its underlying exposure by million  resulting in a net loss of million
