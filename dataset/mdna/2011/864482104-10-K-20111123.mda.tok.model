item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  periods of sustained higher commodity prices can lead to customer conservation  resulting in reduced demand for our product 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the fourth quarter and following fiscal year first quarter 

table of contents weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption 
hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward and option agreements with third parties  and use futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex to purchase and sell propane  fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and option agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory  as well as  in certain instances  forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil 
forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures and option contracts are generally settled in cash at the expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management and reporting to our audit committee  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
as a result of our large customer base  which is comprised of approximately  customers  no individual customer account is material 
therefore  while some variation to actual results occurs  historically such variability has not been material 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
with other assumptions held constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued self insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each unasserted claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
historically  we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly  and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of  in particular  product liability claims  the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates 
however  because of the nature of our insurance arrangements  those material variations historically have not  nor are they expected in the future to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
loss contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
results of operations and financial condition net income for fiscal amounted to million  or per common unit  compared to million  or per common unit  in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal amounted to million  compared to million for fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal included a million charge for severance costs associated with the realignment of the partnership s field operations  as well as a non cash charge of million to accelerate depreciation expense on assets taken out of service

cost of products sold in fiscal included a million unrealized non cash gain attributable to the mark to market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities  compared to a million unrealized non cash loss in the prior year  these unrealized gains and losses are excluded from adjusted ebitda for both periods 
combined operating and general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal year were million  or  lower than the prior year  primarily due to lower variable compensation attributed to lower earnings and continued savings in payroll and benefit related expenses  offset to an extent by higher fuel costs to operate our fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense of million increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of prior year acquisitions  as well as from the increase in accelerated depreciation for assets taken out of service referenced above 
net interest expense of million for fiscal was flat with the prior year 
for the fifth consecutive year  the partnership funded all working capital requirements with cash on hand without the need to borrow under its working capital facility and ended the year with million of cash 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and iii assuming distributions remain at the current annualized level of per common unit  approximately million of distributions to unitholders 
based on our current cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
based on our current forecast of working capital requirements for fiscal  we currently do not expect to borrow under our credit facility to fund those requirements

average propane selling prices in fiscal increased compared to the prior year due to higher product costs  thereby having a positive impact on revenues 
this increase was partially offset by lower retail propane gallons sold in fiscal which decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the volume decline was primarily due to customer conservation efforts attributable to the high commodity price environment and ongoing sluggish economic conditions 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of million in fiscal  which increased million compared to the prior year as a result of the settlement of certain contracts used for risk management purposes see similar increase in cost of products sold

fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes sold in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were primarily attributable to our gasoline and diesel businesses and  to a lesser extent  our heating oil business 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher natural gas and  to a lesser extent  electricity volumes sold  coupled with higher average selling prices associated with higher product costs

cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher average propane product costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the impact of the increase in average propane product costs was partially offset by lower propane volumes sold  which resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold from other propane activities increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher average fuel oil and refined fuel product costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the impact of the increase in product costs was partially offset by lower fuel oil and refined fuels volumes sold  which resulted in an million decrease in cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher natural gas and  to a lesser extent  electricity volumes sold  coupled with an increase in average product costs 
cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues for fiscal increased percentage points to from in the prior year 
the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to wholesale product costs rising at a faster rate than average selling prices in fiscal compared to the prior year 
operating expenses fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands decrease decrease operating expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers 
operating expenses of million for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower variable compensation associated with lower earnings  lower payroll and benefit related expenses resulting from operating efficiencies  and lower insurance costs 
these savings were partially offset by an increase in fuel costs to operate our fleet

table of contents loss on debt extinguishment on march   we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes through a cash tender offer 
in connection with the repurchase  we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of million in the second quarter of fiscal  consisting of million for the repurchase premium and related fees  as well as the write off of million in unamortized debt origination costs and unamortized discount 
net income and adjusted ebitda we reported net income of million  or per common unit in fiscal compared to net income of million  or per common unit in the prior year 
adjusted ebitda amounted to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal were negatively impacted by a million charge for severance costs associated with a realignment of our field operations  as well as a non cash charge of to accelerate depreciation expense on assets taken out of service 
by comparison  net income and ebitda for fiscal were negatively impacted by certain items  including i a loss on debt extinguishment of million associated with the refinancing of senior notes  ii a non cash pension settlement charge of million  and iii a non cash charge of million to accelerate depreciation expense on assets taken out of service 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda excluding the unrealized net gain or loss from mark to market activity for derivative instruments  loss on debt extinguishment  pension settlement charge and severance charges 
our management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as measures of liquidity and we are including them because we believe that they provide our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
in addition  certain of our incentive compensation plans covering executives and other employees utilize adjusted ebitda as the performance target 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use adjusted ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with us gaap 
because ebitda and adjusted ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  they may not be comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies

table of contents total revenues decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september   due to lower volumes  partially offset by higher average selling prices associated with higher product costs 
volumes for the fiscal were lower than the prior year due to the negative impact of adverse economic conditions  particularly on our commercial and industrial accounts  as well as the unfavorable impact of warmer average temperatures  particularly in our northeastern and western service territories  and ongoing residential customer conservation 
from a weather perspective  average temperatures as measured in heating degree days  as reported by noaa  in our service territories during fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year 
in our northeastern territories  which is where we have a higher concentration of residential propane customers and all of our fuel oil customers  average temperatures during fiscal were warmer than both normal and the prior year 
the unfavorable weather pattern occurred primarily during the peak heating months from october through march and therefore  contributed to the lower volumes sold 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million for the year ended september   primarily as a result of higher average selling prices associated with higher product costs  partially offset by lower volumes  particularly in our commercial and industrial accounts 
average propane selling prices in fiscal increased compared to the prior year due to higher product costs  thereby having a positive impact on revenues 
this increase was partially offset by lower retail propane gallons sold in fiscal which decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the volume decline was primarily attributable to lower commercial and industrial volumes resulting from adverse economic conditions  an unfavorable weather pattern and  to a lesser extent  continued residential customer conservation 
lower volumes sold in the non residential customer base accounted for approximately of the decline in propane sales volume 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and other propane activities of million in fiscal  which increased million compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  from million in the prior year primarily due to lower volumes  partially offset by higher average selling prices 
fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable to the aforementioned warmer average temperatures in the northeast region  as well as the impact of ongoing residential customer conservation driven by adverse economic conditions 
average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment in fiscal increased compared to the prior year due to higher product costs  thereby having a positive impact on revenues 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher electricity volumes  partially offset by lower natural gas volumes 
revenues in our all other businesses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year  primarily due to reduced installation service activities as a result of the general market decline in residential and commercial construction and other adverse economic conditions

cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher propane product costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by lower propane volumes  which resulted in a decrease of million in cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold from wholesale and other propane activities increased million compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower volumes  offset to an extent by higher product costs and the unfavorable impact of non cash mark to market adjustments from our risk management activities 
lower fuel oil volumes resulted in a decrease of million in cost of products sold  and higher product costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher electricity volumes  partially offset by lower natural gas volumes 
cost of products sold in our all other businesses of million was relatively flat compared to the prior year 
for fiscal  total cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues increased percentage points to from in the prior year 
the year over year increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the favorable margins reported in the prior year that were attributable to the declining commodity price environment during that period  which situation was not repeated in the current year due to the rising commodity price environment in the current year 
the declining commodity price environment in the prior year favorably impacted our risk management activities in fiscal  and contributed to a reduction in product costs that outpaced the decline in average selling prices 
conversely  the volatile and rising commodity price environment in the current fiscal year presented challenges in managing pricing and  as a result  average product costs increased at a faster pace than average selling prices in fiscal

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in earnings  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods  coupled with a million increase in our investment in working capital as a result of the increase in propane and fuel oil product costs 
despite the year over year increase in working capital requirements  we continued to fund working capital through cash on hand without the need to access the revolving credit facility

the revolving credit facility was executed on june  and replaced the operating partnership s previous credit facility which  as amended  provided for a million term loan the term loan and a separate million working capital facility both of which were scheduled to mature in march borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions until maturity on june  our operating partnership has the right to prepay loans under the revolving credit facility  in whole or in part  without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
at closing  the operating partnership borrowed million under the revolving credit facility and  with cash on hand  repaid the million then outstanding under the term loan and terminated the previous credit agreement 
we have standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of million primarily in support of retention levels under our self insurance programs  which expire periodically through april  therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the revolving credit facility 
the senior notes mature on march  and require semi annual interest payments in march and september 
we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes any time at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the notes 
in addition  the senior notes have a change of control provision that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount repurchased  if the change of control is followed by a rating decline a decrease in the rating of the notes by either moody s investors service or standard and poor s rating group by one or more gradations within days of the consummation of the change of control 

table of contents borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at our operating partnership s option  libor plus the applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of  the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus in each case the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent upon our ratio of total debt to ebitda on a consolidated basis  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
as of september   the interest rate for the revolving credit facility was approximately 
the interest rate and the applicable margin will be reset at the end of each calendar quarter 
on july   our operating partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of march  and a termination date of june  under the interest rate swap agreement  our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
this interest rate swap agreement replaced the previous interest rate swap agreement which terminated on march  the revolving credit facility and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and the partnership  respectively  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants a requiring the consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined  at the partnership level to be not less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b prohibiting the total consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  at the partnership level from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  and c prohibiting the senior secured consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  of the operating partnership from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
under the senior note indenture  we are generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash  as defined  as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter  if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions  and the partnership s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is greater than to we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the senior notes and the revolving credit facility as of september  partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
on october   we announced a quarterly distribution of per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal payable on november  to holders of record on november  
table of contents pension plan assets and obligations our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or as of september  and september  the plan s projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as a result  the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan declined million during fiscal  which was primarily attributable to an increase in the present value of the benefit obligation due to a general decrease in market interest rates  partially offset by a positive return on plan assets during fiscal the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans are recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheets and the changes in the funded status are recognized in comprehensive income loss in the year the changes occur 
our investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
the benefits committee employs a liability driven investment strategy  which seeks to increase the correlation of the plan s assets and liabilities to reduce the volatility of the plan s funded status 
the execution of this strategy has resulted in an asset allocation that is largely comprised of fixed income securities 
a liability driven investment strategy is intended to reduce investment risk and  over the long term  generate returns on plan assets that largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation 
however  as we experienced in fiscal and fiscal  significant declines in interest rates relevant to our benefit obligations  or poor performance in the broader capital markets in which our plan assets are invested  could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan 
for purposes of measuring the projected benefit obligation as of september  and september   we used a discount rate of and  respectively  reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations 
during fiscal  lump sum settlement payments of million exceeded the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost 
during fiscal and fiscal  the amount of the pension benefit obligation settled through lump sum payments did not exceed the settlement threshold  therefore  a settlement charge was not required to be recognized for fiscal or fiscal additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments made in future periods 
we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
partnership employees hired prior to july are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement health care benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
effective january   we changed our postretirement health care plan from a self insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants 

table of contents long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our known contractual obligations as of september  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and dollars in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations a self insurance obligations b other contractual obligations c total a payments exclude costs associated with insurance  taxes and maintenance  which are not material to the operating lease obligations

in addition  the payments do not reflect amounts to be recovered from our insurance providers  which amounts to million  million  million  million  million and million for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter  respectively  and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
c these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet and primarily include payments for postretirement and long term incentive benefits as well as periodic settlements of our interest rate swap agreement 
additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through april  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements guarantees certain of our operating leases  primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal  contain residual value guarantee provisions 
under those provisions  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period  or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of september  and september  recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on achieving a consistent definition of and common requirements for fair value measurement and related disclosure requirements in us gaap 
the new guidance requires quantitative information about unobservable inputs  valuation processes and sensitivity analysis associated with fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  and is effective prospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december   which will be the second quarter of our fiscal year 
early adoption is not permitted 
no material impact is expected on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on increasing the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of partners capital and requires that the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
early adoption of this updated guidance is permitted  and it becomes effective retrospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december   which will be the second quarter of our fiscal year 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued a revised accounting standard allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  as a result of the qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  a more detailed two step goodwill impairment test would be performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of loss to be recognized  if any 
the standard will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the partnership s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 

table of contents product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  supply and demand dynamics for a given time of the year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs  depending on the time of the year 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under accounting rules for derivative instruments and hedging activities  qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts 
such contracts are exempted from fair value accounting and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and option contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter option contracts collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
futures contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then market price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices 
futures are traded with brokers of the nymex and require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk exchange traded futures and option contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with over the counter forward and propane option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non performance by our counterparties 
interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at the operating partnership s option  libor  plus an applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on the level of the partnership s total leverage the total ratio of debt to ebitda 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps have been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was million representing an unrealized loss and is included within other current liabilities and other liabilities  as applicable  with a corresponding debit in oci 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption  are recorded in earnings as they occur 
cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in commodities related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the fair value of open positions as of september  b 
the market prices for the underlying commodities used to determine a 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change and compared to the fair value amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for open futures and option contracts as of september  indicates a reduction in potential future net gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio
