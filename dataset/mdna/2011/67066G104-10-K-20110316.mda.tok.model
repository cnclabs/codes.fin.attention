overview our company nvidia corporation invented the graphics processing unit  or gpu  in since then  we have strived to set new standards in visual computing with interactive graphics available on devices ranging from tablets and smart phones to notebooks and workstations 
our expertise in programmable gpus and computer systems technology has led to breakthroughs in parallel processing which make supercomputing inexpensive and widely accessible 
we are strategically investing in three major areas visual computing  high performance computing and mobile computing 
we serve the visual computing market with our consumer geforce graphics products and professional quadro graphics products  the high performance computing market with our tesla computing solutions products  and the mobile computing market with our tegra system on chip products 
we have three primary financial reporting segments gpu  professional solutions business  or psb and consumer products business  or cpb 
during fiscal years and  we operated and reported four major product line operating segments the gpu business  the psb business  the media and communications processor  or mcp  business  and the cpb business 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal year  we began reporting internally the results of our former mcp segment along with the results of our gpu segment to reflect the way we manage the gpu business 
comparative periods presented reflect this change 
our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce discrete and chipset products which support desktop and notebook personal computers  or pcs  plus memory products 
our psb is comprised of our quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products  including our nvidia tesla high performance computing products 
our cpb is comprised of our tegra mobile products which support tablets  smartphones  personal media players  or pmps  internet television  automotive navigation  and other similar devices 
cpb also includes license  royalty  other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  add in card ma nufacturers  system builders and consumer electronics companies worldwide utilize our processors as a core component of their entertainment  business and professional solutions 
we were incorporated in california in april and reincorporated in delaware in april our headquarter facilities are in santa clara  california

recent developments  future objectives and challenges gpu business during fiscal year  we took the computational capabilities of our gpus to a new level with the launch of our fermi architecture 
fermi gpus are designed to excel at tessellation  the key feature of directx  and to allow game developers to increase the level of physics realism via our physx api 
our flagship product for the desktop  the geforce gtx  was followed by a complete line up of series gpus 
later in the year  we refreshed them with our series gpus  which significantly increased the performance of the products they replaced while fitting into similar power envelopes 
we also launched m and m series gpus for notebooks  along with our optimus technology  which switches invisibly between discrete gpu and integrated graphics controller depending on the user s activities 
by doing so  nvidia optimus provides notebook users with the battery life of integrated graphics  but with the gaming performance of a discrete graphics processor 
pc manufacturers also are expected to launch hundreds of new pcs that use these new geforce gpus paired with intel corporation s sandy bridge cpus 
during fiscal year  we also announced our plans to develop a custom central processing unit  or cpu  that will use the arm instruction set 
these cpu cores will be integrated into future generation gpus for pcs  servers  and supercomputers 
professional solutions business during fiscal year  our quadro business benefitted from the strength of our fermi architecture with the launch of the quadro midrange gpu and the quadro entry level gpu 
these professional graphics solutions put the computational and visualization benefits of our fermi architecture within reach of all engineers  designers and animators  with the quadro delivering significantly higher performance across leading cad applications and the quadro positioned at a competitive price performance point 
the new quadro gpus deliver performance that is up to five times faster for d applications and up to eight times faster for computational simulation than our previous quadro generation products 
our tesla supercomputing business continued to make progress with key project wins not only in our core market segments  but also with traction in a number of new focus areas 
consumer products business during fiscal year  we saw promising signs in our tegra business  helped by adoption to the android operating system 
tegra shipment volumes began to ramp up late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we expect the momentum to continue into the first quarter of fiscal year  fueled by the production release of android based smartphone and tablet products 
during the fiscal year  we had multiple tegra design wins in both tablets and smartphones 
our customers  including acer inc  dell inc  lg electronics inc 
and motorola solutions  inc  announced a number of products incorporating the tegra mobile processor 
we also demonstrated our next generation mobile processor  the world s first quad core mobile processor  at mobile world congress 
during fiscal year  we announced that volkswagen ag and audi ag will use our next generation tegra starting in in addition  we announced that bmw group will use our gpus for infotainment systems in next generation cars worldwide 
tesla motors will also incorporate tegra processors to power the infotainment  navigation and instrument cluster in its roadster model s 
patent cross license agreement on january   we entered into a new six year patent cross licensing agreement  or the license agreement  with intel 
under the license agreement  intel has granted to nvidia and its qualified subsidiaries  and nvidia has granted to intel and intel s qualified subsidiaries  a non exclusive  non transferable  worldwide license  without the right to sublicense to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first filing date on or before march   to make  have made subject to certain limitations  use  sell  offer to sell  import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor and electronic related products anywhere in the world 
nvidia s rights to intel s patents have certain specified limitations  including but not limited to  nvidia was not granted a license to certain microprocessors  defined in the license agreement as intel processors or intel compatible processors  certain chipsets that connect to intel processors  or certain flash memory products 
in connection with the license agreement  nvidia and intel mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes 
under the license agreement  intel will pay nvidia an aggregate amount of billion  payable in annual installments  as follows a million payment on each of january   january  and january  and a million payment on each of january   and the license agreement between nvidia and intel includes multiple elements 
as a result  we determined each element of the license agreement  their fair value and when they should be recognized 
the elements of the license agreement are accounted for as follows legal settlement in connection with the license agreement  both parties agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes 
the fair value allocated to the settlement of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as a benefit to operating expense 
license to intel we will recognize  million in total  or million per quarter  as revenue over the term of the agreement of six years  the period over which intel will have access to newly filed nvidia patents 
we will commence recognition of the license revenue in april when our performance obligation under the agreement begins 
consideration received in advance of the performance period will be classified as deferred revenue 
license from intel we recognized million as an intangible asset upon execution of the agreement 
amortization of million per quarter will be charged to cost of sales over the seven year estimated useful life of the technology beginning in april please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information regarding this cross license and the settlement 
product defect our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  includi ng for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field  which could cause our revenue to decline 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations 
the net charge amounted to million  of which million was charged against cost of revenue 
the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk 
included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during the second quarter of fiscal year with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and the other estimated consumer class action settlement 
as a result of this settlement  the other related estimated settlement  and offsetting insurance reimbursements  we recorded a net charge of million to sales  general and administrative expense during the second quarter of fiscal year together with the million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs  this brings the total cumulative net charge to million  of which million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales  general and administrative expenses 
the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities 
certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates 
testing suggests a weak material set of die package combination  system thermal management designs  and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures 
we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips 
we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs 
we intend to fully support our custom ers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail  and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 
the weak die packaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 
in september  october and november  several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us  asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information regarding this litigation and the settlement 
tender offer during the first quarter of fiscal year  we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options 
the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than per share 
none of the non employee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including our former chief financial officer  marvin d 
burkett  were eligible to participate in the offer 
all eligible options with exercise prices less than per share  but not less than per share  were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
all eligible options with exercise prices greater than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
a total of million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of million  which was paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options 
as a result of the tender offer  we incurred a charge during fiscal year of million consisting of million related to the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer  million related to stock based compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options  plus million related to associated payroll taxes  professional fees and other costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cash equivalents and marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill  stock based compensation  warranty liabilities  litigation  investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  or board 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for most sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our policy on sales to certain distributors  with rights of return  is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product  as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets 
we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale  unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate 
unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs 
we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense  depending on the nature of the program 
mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products 
depending on market conditions  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize this license revenue over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service arrangements  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties 
we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses  and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy 
our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers  the financial institutions providing letters of credit  or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to ma ke payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen  such as the when the worldwide economy is experiencing a significant downturn 
the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the risk that financial institutions mighty consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a lower than normal level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from this type of credit crisis on our business  including inability of customers  including channel partners  to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer  insolvencies and failure of financial institutions  which could negatively impact our financial results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obt ain credit insurance in the future 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future 
factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables  the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit 
we have incurred cumulative bad debts of million over the last three fiscal years 
as a result of our low bad debt experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and during fiscal years and  respectively 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented of our gross accounts receivable balance 
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis  which approximates actual cost on an average or first in  first out basis 
inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs  including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory provisions and shipping costs 
we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand  future product purchase commitments  estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our future product pu rchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down  our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted 
as of january   our inventory reserve was million 
as a percentage of our gross inventory balance  our inventory reserve has ranged between and during fiscal years and as of january   our inventory reserve represented of our gross inventory balance 
warranty liabilities cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition 
under limited circumstances  we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products 
our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
during fiscal year  we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations 
the net charge amounted to million  of which million was charged against cost of revenue 
the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk 
included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during fiscal year with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and another related estimated consumer class action settlement 
as a result of this settlement  the other estimated settlement  and offsetting insurance reimbursements  we recorded a net charge of million to sales  general and administrative expense during fiscal year together with the million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs  this brings the total cumulative net charge to million  of which million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales  general and administrative 
determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience  test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return and replacement and other associated costs 
however  if actual repair  return  replacement and other associated costs and or actual field failure rates exceed our estimates  we may be required to record additional reserves  which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 
income taxes we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non us subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than ou r current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not  we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period the realization occurred 
our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of million as of january  consistent with prior years  the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity  if and when realized 
in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized  we have elected to utilize the with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits 
we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purpos es  and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
please refer to note of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for additional information 
goodwill our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments  or components of an operating segment  for the purposes of completing our goodwill impairment test 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fisca l year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our market capitalization increased over when compared to the same period in fiscal year we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
this assessment was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  analysis of market comparables  where appropriate  and analysis of our market capitalization 
determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimat es on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
our estimates of cash flows were based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models  which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
the long term financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
significa nt differences between our estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results  which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of some or all of our reporting units 
determining the fair value of our reporting units also requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables  if there are any  and the amount of weight to ascribe to fair value measurements that are based on the market approach 
any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting units  reductions in the value of market comparables  or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 
such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of the goodwill associated with some or all of our reporting units 
cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition 
marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased 
we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholder s equity  net of tax 
any unrealized losses which are considered to be other than temporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our conso lidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value 
the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets 
our level assets consist of our money market funds 
we classify securities within level assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
our available for sale securities are classified as having level inputs 
our level assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian 
most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level inputs 
as of january   we collected the balance of our investment in the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd  or international reserve fund  that was classified as a level input due to the inherent subjectivity and the significant judgment involved in its valuation 
as such  we do not have any investment classified as level as of january  all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary  or have other indicators of impairments 
if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument 
if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value 
for available for sale debt instruments that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss  if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation cost for equity awards is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units  or rsus 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these vari ables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  vesting schedules  death and disability probabilities  expected volatility and risk free interest 
our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 
using the binomial model  we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during the fiscal year ended january  weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield accounting standards also require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
our stock based compensation expense for employee stock purchase plan is recognized using an accelerated amortization method 
we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year ended january   using the following assumptions weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation  fines and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation  investigations or settlements is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events  we will record the loss in accordance with usg aap 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs

fiscal year revenue was billion for the fiscal year and billion for fiscal year  an increase of 
for the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect revenue to grow by six to eight percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal year a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue decreased by to billion for fiscal year compared to billion for fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 
also sales of mainstream desktop gpu decreased as a result of lower unit shipments driven by weakness in our end customer markets related to unstable economic conditions and increased competition in the lower end market segments 
offsetting these declines were increases in sales of our notebook gpu  high end desktop gpu and memory products 
the growth in sales of notebook gpu products was driven by a continuin g shift in the market demand towards notebook pcs from desktop pcs as reported in the december pc graphics report from mercury research 
the growth in memory sales and high end desktop gpu products was driven primarily by the launch of our new generation of gpus with fermi architecture 
psb 
psb revenue increased by to million for the fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year both the average selling price  or asp  and unit shipments of professional workstation products increased due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year in addition  we saw strong growth in our tesla products from the prior year as our high performance computing line gained traction fueled by the fermi architecture release 
cpb 
cpb revenue increased by to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from ramp up in our tegra products  offset by decreases in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets 
revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game console related products increased slightly in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue was billion for the fiscal year and billion for fiscal year  a decrease of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to billion for fiscal year compared to billion for fiscal year the increase was primarily driven by sales of our ion products 
this was offset by a decrease in sales of our notebook gpus  driven primarily by a combination of a decline in unit demand and a decline in asp as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and due to share losses we experienced within the notebook segment  during calendar year compared to calendar year as reported in the november pc graphics report from mercury research 
psb 
psb revenue decreased by to million for the fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year both the asps and unit shipments of professional workstation products decreased  primarily due to the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year cpb 
cpb revenue increased by to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase in cpb revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from our embedded products for the automotive and entertainment markets  and was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from development arrangements and royalties from game console related products in the comparative periods 
concentration of revenue we generated  and of our total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas 
revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 
revenue from significant customers  those representing or more of total revenue for the respective dates  is summarized as follows year ended january  january  january  revenue customer a customer b customer c gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs  including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs 
cost of revenue also includes development costs for license  service arrangements and stock based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 
gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margin was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 
our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets  lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix 
we expect gross margin to be in the range of to during the first quarter of fiscal year a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows fiscal year vs 
fiscal year our gross margin increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily due to increased unit sales  mix and better asps of our high end desktop gpu  notebook gpu and workstation products 
cost efficiencies and pricing decisions also helped margin improve in the current fiscal year 
additionally  fiscal year included million charge related to the company s tender offer to purchase certain stock options for personnel related to manufacturing which resulted in an adverse impact on gross margins that did not occur in fiscal year offsetting these favorable impacts  we recorded a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year related to a weak die packing material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips 
our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately and in fiscal years and  respectively 
offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves 
the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a unfavorable impact in fiscal year and a favorable impact in fiscal year gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business remained comparable during fiscal year and fiscal year while higher inventory reserves due to future demand concerns in the first half of fiscal year and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak die packaging material set reduced gross margin for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  this was more than offset by higher unit sales  mix and asps in the high end desktop and notebook product lines 
psb 
the gross margin of our psb remained flat during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year improvements in gross margin as a result of better asps and shipment volumes in our quadro product line were offset by higher inventory reserves recorded in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year tesla gross margin improved due to better production efficiencies was driven by lower product cost and higher unit sales  while asps remained stable 
cpb 
the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was a result of better asps and higher unit shipment of our tegra products as well as slightly better revenue from higher margin products and services  including development arrangements and royalties from game console related products  in the comparative periods 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year our gross margin increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by improved yields of our nm products  transition to nm products  as well as other manufacturing cost reductions  and more favorable product mix  particularly with increased sales of higher margin mcp products 
furthermore  during the first quarter of fiscal year our gross margin benefited from the sell through of inventory that had previously been written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this did not have a significant impact on our gross margin for the remaining quarters in fiscal year offsetting these improvements  we recorded a charge to cost of revenue  net of insurance reimbursement in the amount of millio n in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year related to weak die packing material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips 
gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by a shift in mcp product mix toward higher margin intel based and amd based platform products 
we also recorded greater benefits to cost of revenue for insurance reimbursement received and a reduction in the warranty charge arising from a weak die packing material set in certain versions of our previous generation products as compared to prior year 
additionally  improving yields of our nm products  a transition to nm products  and other manufacturing cost reductions achieved during fiscal year contributed to improvements in gross margin 
offsetting these improvements we re lower asps in our mainstream desktop gpu products as well as in our notebook gpu products that we believe were driven by pricing pressures in the marketplace over the comparable period 
psb 
the gross margin of our psb decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decline in asps caused primarily by pricing pressure resulting from the relatively slow recovery of corporate spending during fiscal year following the economic recession that began during fiscal year cpb 
the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was a result of declining revenue from higher margin products and services  including development arrangements and royalties from game console related products  in the comparative periods

during fiscal year  non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amor tization of million 
the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year increased when compared to fiscal year was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  including increases in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in inventory resulting from an increase in inventory turnover 
additionally  while we experienced a net loss in fiscal year of million  versus a net loss of million in fiscal year  non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million

our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents  asset backed securities  commercial paper  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  money market funds and debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
as of january   we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our statement of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other than temporary

two customers accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable balance at january  while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful account s for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure

all eligible options wit h exercise prices equal to or greater than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
a total of million options were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash purchase price of million  which was paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options 
as a result of the tender offer  we incurred a charge of million consisting of million related to the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the options tendered in the offer  million related to stock based compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options  plus million related to associated payroll taxes  professional fees and other costs

stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us  subject to certain specifications  to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of billion through may the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  or in structured stock repurchase programs  and may be made in one or more larger repurchases  in compliance with rule b of the securities exchange act  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
as part of our share repurchase program  we have entered into  and we may continue to enter into  structured sh are repurchase transactions with financial institutions 
these agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement  and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock  within a pre determined range  at the end of the term of the agreement 
we did not enter into any structured share repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal year ended january  through january   we have repurchased an aggregate of million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of billion 
as of january   we are authorized  subject to certain specifications  to repurchase shares of our common stock up to billion through may operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from opera tions and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures during fiscal year  primarily for property development  leasehold improvements  software licenses  emulation equipment  computers and engineering workstations 
in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 
for additional factors see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business  industry and partners our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed  which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 
product defect our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  i ncluding for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field  which could cause our revenue to decline 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an additional charge to cover the estimated remaining customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations 
the net charge amounted to million  of which million was charged against cost of revenue 
the extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk 
included in the charge are the estimated costs of implementing a settlement reached during the second quarter of fiscal year with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and the other estimated consumer class action settlement 
as a result of this settlement  the other related estimated settlement  and offsetting insurance reimbursements  we recorded a net charge of million to sales  general and administrative expense during the second quarter of fiscal year together with the million net charge we had previously recorded for related estimated costs  this brings the total cumulative net charge to million  of which million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales  general and administrative 
the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities 
certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates 
testing suggests a weak material set of die package combination  system thermal management designs  and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures 
we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips 
we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs 
we intend to fully support our custom ers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail  and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 
the weak die packaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production 
in september  october and november  several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us  asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information regarding this litigation and the settlement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment and interest rate risk as of january  and january   we had billion and billion  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents  asset backed securities  commercial paper  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  money market funds and debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
as of january   we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities 
our investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securit ies we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately million 
the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  inability of customers  including channel partners  to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer  including channel partner  insolvencies  and failure of financial institutions  which may negatively impact our treasury operations 
other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments  impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments  interest rates  and cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 
as of january   our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately of our total investment portfolio  while the financial sector accounted for approximately of our total investment portfolio 
of the financial sector investments  over half are guaranteed by the us government 
substantially all of our investments are with a a or better rated securities 
if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by  t he fair values of these investments would decline by approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant 
the impact of foreign currency transaction loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively i mpact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january
