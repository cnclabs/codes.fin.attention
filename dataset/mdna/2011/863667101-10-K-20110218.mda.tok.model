critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that  of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis 
these marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues  including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing  product royalty and foreign branch arrangements  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates 
because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
legal and other contingencies the company is involved in various proceedings  legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business  including proceedings related to product  labor and intellectual property  and other matters that are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in certain of the legal proceedings  the claimants seek damages  as well as other compensatory relief  which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements 
for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the company s future obligations  a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable cost  or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known  for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded 
the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel  previous settlement experience and settlement strategies 
if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be incurred  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters  the company purchases third party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations 
future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried 
in addition  such matters may negatively impact the company s ability to obtain cost effective third party insurance coverage in future periods

the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as  in  nonfunctional cash balances associated with the anticipated acquisition of the neurovascular division from boston scientific and  in  intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies
