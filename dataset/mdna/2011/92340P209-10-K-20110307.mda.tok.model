overview since our merger in june with celunol corporation  or celunol  a cellulosic ethanol company  we have operated in two business segments  biofuels and specialty enzymes 
on september   we completed the sale of our ligno cellulosic business unit  or lc business  to bp biofuels north america llc  or bp 
as part of the sale  bp acquired all of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  verenium biofuels corporation  as well as assets  including intellectual property  used in or related to the lc business 
we retained all assets used exclusively in our industrial enzymes business 
today  we operate in one business segment  industrial enzymes  to enable higher productivity  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we have three main product lines animal health and nutrition  grain processing  and oilseed processing 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our business will be derived from continued sales and gross product margins from our existing portfolio of enzyme products 
our business is supported by a research and development team with expertise in gene discovery and optimization  cell engineering  bioprocess development  biochemistry and microbiology 
over nearly years  our research and development team has developed a proprietary technology platform that has enabled us to apply advancements in science to discovering and developing unique solutions in complex industrial or commercial applications 
we have dedicated substantial resources to the development of capabilities for sample collection from the world s microbial populations  generation of dna libraries  screening of these libraries using ultra high throughput methods capable of analyzing more than one billion genes per day  and optimization based on our gene evolution technologies 
we have continued to shift more of our resources from technology development to commercialization efforts for our existing and future technologies and products 
while our technologies have the potential to serve many large markets  our primary areas of focus for product development are specialty enzymes for animal health and nutrition  grain processing  oilseed processing  and emerging enzyme markets 
we have current collaborations and agreements with key partners such as bunge oils  alfa laval  desmet ballestra  danisco animal nutrition  and weissbiotech formerly add food services gmbh  each of which complement our internal technology  product development efforts  and distribution efforts 
we own or have access to a substantial intellectual property estate comprising more than issued patents and more than pending patent applications as of december   which includes the patents we sold to bp and under which we have a non exclusive license from bp 
we believe that we can leverage our owned and licensed intellectual property estate to enhance and improve our technology development and commercialization efforts while maintaining protection on key intellectual property assets 
we have incurred net losses from our continuing operations since our inception 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss from continuing operations of million  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
we expect to incur losses in the near term as a result of any combination of one or more of the following continued research and development expenses for the progression of internal product candidates  our continued investment in manufacturing facilities and or capabilities necessary to meet anticipated demand for our products or improve manufacturing yields  and maintaining or increasing our sales and marketing infrastructure 

table of contents results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  we believe that our historical results are not a good indicator of our future operating results 
as more fully described in the risk factors beginning on page  liquidity and capital resources beginning on page and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report  in connection with the sale of our lc business in september as described below  we obtained net cash proceeds of approximately million  including final working capital adjustment in november to date the company has used net proceeds of approximately million from the transaction for debt retirement 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for continued investment in product development and manufacturing improvement efforts for our industrial enzyme business  for general corporate purposes  including working capital  and  as appropriate  for additional debt retirement 
the holders of the and notes have the right to require us to purchase the and notes for cash including any accrued and unpaid interest on april   april  and april  assuming this occurs in  based on our current cash resources and operating plan  our existing working capital will not be sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned operating expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements after this date without additional sources of cash 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will need to defer  reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
recent strategic events asset purchase agreement and related agreements as noted above  on september   we completed the sale of our lc business to bp  pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated july  the transaction resulted in estimated net cash proceeds to us of million including million of the purchase price placed in escrow 
in the transaction  bp acquired all of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  verenium biofuels  as well as assets of the company  including intellectual property used in or related to the lc business 
we retained all assets used exclusively in our industrial enzymes business 
in accordance with the asset purchase agreement  certain of our employees whose services were used in the biofuels business were transferred to bp at closing 
we and bp entered into reciprocal transition services agreements dated september   with respect to the provision of certain transitional support services for a period of two years following the closing 
we performed an analysis of these transition service agreements and determined they were not material and therefore did not represent significant continuing obligations to preclude discontinued operations treatment 
additionally  we and bp entered into license agreements dated september   pursuant to which we granted bp a license to certain intellectual property that we retained  and bp granted us a license to certain intellectual property acquired by bp 
with respect to most of such intellectual property  the licenses are nonexclusive  worldwide  perpetual  royalty free and sublicensable  subject to certain field of use restrictions in the case of the license to bp 
the parties also entered into a sublicense agreement dated september   pursuant to which we received a sublicense to certain intellectual property acquired by bp that is licensed from a third party  as well as a joint intellectual property agreement dated september   governing the joint ownership by bp and us of certain intellectual property in which each of bp and we have an equal  undivided joint ownership interest following the closing of the transaction 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  at closing we and bp also entered into non competition agreements dated september   which restrict the parties respective activities in which they may engage for certain time periods following the closing  impose confidentiality obligations with respect to proprietary information acquired from each other  and prohibit the solicitation of the each other s employees for a period of two years following the closing 

table of contents the results of operations and assets and liabilities associated with the sale of our lc business have been restated and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for and all prior periods presented 
debt repurchase on september   we announced our repurchase of million in principal amount of senior convertible notes due april   or notes  as well as million in principal amount of our notes 
as part of the transaction the noteholders released us from any and all commitments and indebtedness related to the and notes repurchased 
immediately following the repurchase and as of december   no additional notes remain outstanding and we had million in principal amount of and notes outstanding 
change in management on february   we announced a series of management changes within our senior management team to take effect on march  pursuant to which carlos a 
riva  currently president  chief executive officer and director  will retire  james e 
levine  currently executive vice president and chief financial officer  will be appointed as president and chief executive officer and will be elected to the board of directors  and jeffrey g 
black  currently senior vice president and chief accounting officer  will be appointed chief financial officer 
mr 
riva will continue to serve as chief executive officer until march  and the company expects that following his retirement  mr 
riva will enter into a consulting agreement with the company under which he will be available for a period of time 
results of operations continuing operations consolidated results of operations revenues revenues for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change revenues animal health and nutrition grain processing all other products total product collaborative total revenues revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our revenue mix continued to shift to a larger percentage of product revenues as opposed to collaborative revenues  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales 
product revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues increased  or million  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from fuelzyme alpha amylase and our newer enzyme products in our grain processing product line  which continued to gain acceptance in the grain ethanol markets 
in addition  our purifine plc enzyme for the soybean oil processing market achieved significant revenue growth over  resulting from purifine plc deployment by molinos in argentina under the supply agreement we announced in march  as well as our bunge agreements 
net revenues from the animal health and nutrition product line  primarily phyzyme xp phytase  decreased million  or  for the 
table of contents year ended december  as compared to the same period in  and represented approximately of total product revenues for the year ended december  and for the comparable period in although we expect that phyzyme xp phytase will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total product revenues in the foreseeable future  we expect that net revenue from phyzyme xp phytase will remain flat or gradually decrease in future periods 
this is largely due to our method of revenue recognition for phyzyme xp phytase product sales 
we manufacture most of our enzyme products through a manufacturing facility in mexico city owned by fermic sa  or fermic 
we also have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme xp phytase 
we recognize revenue from phyzyme xp phytase that is manufactured by genencor in an amount equal to the royalty received from danisco  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus the royalty on operating profit we currently recognize for phyzyme xp phytase we manufacture at fermic 
while this revenue recognition treatment has little or no negative impact on the gross margin in absolute dollars we recognize for every sale of phyzyme xp phytase  it does have a negative impact on the gross product revenue we recognize for phyzyme xp phytase as the volume of phyzyme xp phytase manufactured by genencor increases 
we expect over time a greater proportion of our phyzyme xp phytase manufacturing will transition to genencor resulting in lower reported phyzyme xp phytase product revenue  however  we believe this will make available existing capacity to accommodate expected growth for our other enzyme products  which we expect will generate higher gross margins than phyzyme xp phytase over time 
while we cannot be certain that demand for our enzyme products and resulting sales will continue to meet expectations  during we have seen indications of recovery from the worldwide recession  which we believe have positively impacted our revenues 
in particular during  we and our partner danisco  saw a softening in the phytase animal feed market attributed to a recessionary decline in consumer consumption of protein and financial distress in the poultry industry  which negatively impacted demand for feed and thus our enzyme  particularly during the first half of nevertheless  phyzyme xp phytase sales have recovered in  as demand for poultry has begun to recover with improved economic conditions 
demand for fuelzyme alpha amylase was significantly impacted by challenges in the corn ethanol industry during  which experienced distress due to high corn prices and low ethanol prices 
during the first half of  there were several well publicized bankruptcies  including two of the largest producers of corn ethanol in the us operating rates in the industry were significantly reduced  which negatively impacted demand for enzymes in the first half of during  we saw ethanol plant operating rates return to pre levels  and some idle capacity was brought back on line  signaling a recovery in the corn ethanol industry 
there still remains no certainty on global outcomes  as we have again noted increasing corn prices in early which could affect the demand for our product 
latin america  a primary market for purifine plc  used for soybean oil processing  suffered drought  political upheaval over taxes on agricultural exports  and overall challenging market conditions during the initial launch of purifine plc 
as a result  adoption of purifine plc in the region was delayed  thus purifine plc revenue was below expectations for during  however  we began to see strong commercial traction for purifine plc  which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future 
most notably  we have seen continued strong demand for purifine plc under our long term contract with molinos  operator of the world s largest soybean processing plant in argentina 
collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   due in large part to a decrease in revenue related to wind down of projects with existing strategic collaborators 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand  renew  or enter into new collaborations that we believe fit our strategic focus and represent product commercialization opportunities in the future  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing or expanding existing collaborations  or securing new collaboration partners 

table of contents our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products  timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  as well as regulatory approval timelines for new products 
product gross profit margin product gross profit and margin for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities  royalties and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  the increases in cost of product revenue from the comparable periods in the prior year is primarily due to higher rental expense for incremental fermentation capacity to support the expansion of product mix and increase in product revenues 
our cost of product revenues will generally grow in proportion to revenues  although we expect to achieve benefits from the additional investments we are making at fermic to better accommodate our enzyme manufacturing capabilities 
because a large percentage of total manufacturing costs are fixed  we should realize margin improvements as product revenues increase  however  margins could be negatively impacted in the future if product revenues do not grow in line with our committed fermentation capacity at fermic 
we further expanded our fermentation capacity during the third quarter of  which increased fixed manufacturing costs by an additional million per quarter 
in addition  gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we typically experience lower margins in the early stages of commercial production for our newer enzyme products like purifine plc  as we optimize the manufacturing process for each particular product 
product gross profit totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  gross profit percentage increased primarily due to improved fixed costs leverage on higher revenue  resulting from increased demand and expansion of product mix partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing yields  primarily related to newer enzyme products like purifine plc 
in addition  because phyzyme xp phytase represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross profit is impacted to a great degree by the gross margin achieved on sales of phyzyme xp phytase 
under our manufacturing and sales agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme xp phytase inventory to danisco at our cost and  under a license agreement  receive a royalty equal to of danisco s profit from the sale of the product  as defined  when the product is sold to danisco s customer 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme xp phytase is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and the royalty on operating profit is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to danisco s customer as reported to us by danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty on operating profit based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of profit share is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty on operating profit from quarter to quarter 
these adjustments  while typically considered immaterial in absolute dollars  could have a significant impact on our reported product gross profit from quarter to quarter 

table of contents in addition  our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme xp phytase contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume manufacturing rights for phyzyme xp phytase 
if danisco decides to exercise this right  we will likely experience excess capacity at fermic 
if we are unable to absorb this excess capacity with other products in the event that danisco assumes all or a portion of phyzyme xp phytase manufacturing rights  this may have a negative impact on our revenues and our product gross profit 
operating expenses research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands change research and development selling  general and administrative expenses total operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased  or million  to million including share based compensation of million compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation  total operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to million bonus paid and expensed during the third quarter of as well as an additional million in bonus accrued through  and increased litigation costs of million primarily related to our noteholder lawsuit  which has subsequently been resolved see item  legal proceedings 
this increase in expenses was partially offset by million of debt issuance costs recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of related to our notes exchange and notes amendment 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on unfunded product development  and that approximately were spent on research activities funded in whole or in part by our partners 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on unfunded product and technology development  and that approximately were spent on research activities funded by our collaborations and grants 
we determine which products and technologies to pursue independently based on various criteria  including market opportunity  investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products and technologies require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products and technologies may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts  the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including trials and regulatory approvals  if needed  it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products and technologies  if any  are ultimately marketed  
table of contents we have product candidates and technologies in various stages of development related to collaborations and grants as well as internally developed products and technologies 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products and technologies that we had intended to pursue independently  and funding for existing products or projects may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all  which may cause us to defer or reduce our product development efforts 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product and technology development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential commercialization candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have any products or technologies approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in this report under risk factors 
our research and development expenses increased  or million to million for the year ended december   compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation  total research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to million bonus paid and expensed during the third quarter of as well as an additional million of bonus accrued during  as well as increased research and development efforts consistent with our shift in focus to higher investment in pipeline technologies 
historically  due to limited capital resources  challenging economic conditions  and a focus on cellulosic biofuels technology development through our recently sold lc business  we have not spent significant resources on early stage product development for the past three years 
beginning in the fourth quarter  we began making additional investment for the development and commercialization of candidates in our enzyme product pipeline 
we expect these expenses to increase in as we further advance enzyme product candidates through the development pipeline 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation  selling  general and administrative increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase year over year is attributed to million bonus paid and expensed during the third quarter of as well as an additional million of bonus accrued during  and increased litigation costs of million primarily related to the noteholder lawsuit  partially offset by million of debt issuance costs during the third quarter of related to our notes exchange and notes amendment 
despite an expected increase in selling expenses to maintain or increase our sales and marketing infrastructure  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as we focus on cost control and aligning our administrative and overhead expenses to support a smaller organization following the sale of the lc business 
share based compensation charges we recognized million and million in share based compensation expense for our share based awards in continuing operations during the years ended december  and share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative 
table of contents share based compensation decreased  or million  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended  primarily related to the acceleration of all non executive restricted stock awards during the third quarter of  as well as the acceleration of a group of performance based options held by certain executives during the second quarter of and the suspension of our employee stock purchase plan during the first quarter of additionally  in connection with the sale of our lc business  several option cancellations occurred during the third quarter as a result of employee transfers and terminations decreasing expense  and a further decrease in expense attributed to the longer vesting periods due to our option exchange during  offset by a company wide grant made during the third quarter of interest and other expense  net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributed to the decrease in the outstanding principal from conversions  exchanges  and repurchases 
total interest expense for the years ended december  and was comprised of the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash accretion of debt discount non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash amortization of debt premium notes total equipment financing other capitalized interest total interest expense on october   we entered into an agreement with syngenta in connection with the completion of previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration 
as of the separation date  approximately million in deferred revenue was outstanding related to syngenta for unearned  prepaid research funding under the previous agreement 
the million was recognized as gain on contract settlement for the year ended december   as the amount represented cash received in excess of research labor hours incurred  for which we had not completed the revenue earning process 
gain on amendment of notes in connection with the amendment of the notes in september  the notes conversion price was reduced from to and the anti dilution protection included in the notes was changed from full ratchet anti dilution protection to  in most cases  a version of broad based weighted average anti dilution protection  subject to certain limitations 
pursuant to authoritative guidance  we determined that the amendment qualified as a liability extinguishment  and recorded a gain on the amendment of million  equal to the difference between the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative before and after the amendment 

table of contents gain on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt for the years ended december  and  we recorded a gain on conversion of million and million  calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the shares of common stock delivered to the noteholders upon conversion 
the carrying value of the converted notes during the year ended december  was equal to the million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes that were converted and related make whole payments 
the carrying value of the converted notes during the year ended december  was equal to million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes and make whole payments 
loss on debt extinguishment on september   we repurchased million in principal amount of our and notes for a total of million in cash  excluding accrued interest as of the closing date 
the repurchase allowed us to simplify our capital structure as well as avoid any potential further dilution through conversions 
the repurchase qualified for debt extinguishment accounting resulting in a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  representing the difference between the purchase price of million and carrying value of million calculated as follows in thousands notes notes total principal debt discount compound embedded derivative issuance costs carrying value repurchase price gain loss on debt extinguishment gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative  the warrants  the convertible hedge transaction in connection with our notes and notes compound embedded derivative are recorded as a derivative asset or liability and marked to market at each balance sheet date 
the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities 
we recorded a net loss of million and a net gain of million for the years ended december  and related to the change in fair value of our recorded derivative asset and liabilities 
net income loss from discontinued operations as previously noted  on september   we completed the sale of the lc business to bp for a purchase price of million 
the transaction resulted in net cash proceeds to the company of million including million of the purchase price placed in escrow 
as such  the legacy lc business current and prior periods presented in this report have been reclassified to reflect the legacy lc business as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   net income from discontinued operations was million and included a million gain on sale of the lc business  net of tax provision of million 
for the year ended december   net loss from discontinued operations was million 

table of contents income tax benefit authoritative accounting guidance requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income and items charged directly to stockholders equity 
this allocation is referred to as intra period tax allocation 
as a result of net book income from discontinued operations  we recorded an income tax expense of million during the year ended december  an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million was recorded during december   resulting in overall annual income tax expense to zero 
years ended december  and consolidated results of operations continuing operations revenues revenues for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change revenues animal health and nutrition grain processing all other products total product collaborative and grant total revenues revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our revenue mix continued to shift to a larger percentage of product revenues  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales  and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues decreased or million  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this decrease is attributed primarily to the following factors while gross shipments of phyzyme xp phytase for the year ended december  remained at levels comparable to  our reported net phyzyme xp phytase revenue was lower than our reported net revenue in the same periods of the prior year 
this is attributed to a larger percentage of phyzyme xp phytase sales manufactured by genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  for which we recognize only the royalty component on operating profit for phyzyme xp phytase sales 
due to capacity constraints during late  we contracted with genencor to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme xp phytase 
we recognize revenue from phyzyme xp phytase that is manufactured by genencor in an amount equal to the royalty on operating profit we receive from danisco  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalty on operating profit we recognize for phyzyme xp phytase we manufacture at fermic 
we discontinued two of our product lines  bayovac srs and quantum  during early the decrease in phyzyme xp phytase product revenue was offset in part by an increase in sales of our fuelzyme alpha amylase and xylathin enzymes  which continued to gain acceptance in the grain ethanol markets  and our veretase alpha amylase enzyme for the potable ethanol market 
revenues from phyzyme xp phytase represented approximately of total product revenues for the year ended december  and 
table of contents collaboration and grant revenue decreased or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to we continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
on october   we completed previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration with syngenta 
in connection with the completion of those programs  the parties executed an agreement whereby we gained additional exclusive rights to an array of proprietary biomolecules expressed microbially  as well as non exclusive rights to the same biomolecules expressed through non plant means such as algae  further bolstering our specialty enzymes product pipeline 
product gross profit margin product gross profit and margin for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin cost of product revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the change in production for our phyzyme xp phytase product revenue and related cost manufactured by genencor as described below  combined with inventory losses and additional freight costs incurred in as further described below 
product gross margin totaled million  or of product revenue for the year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenue for the year ended december  gross margin percentage improvement for the year ended december  reflects various factors  specifically due to our manufacturing arrangement with genencor to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme xp phytase as previously described  we record revenue and costs related to phyzyme xp phytase that genencor manufactures on a net basis versus a gross basis 
this had no impact on the absolute value of our gross margin  but resulted in an increase to the gross margin percentage reported for the year ended december  during the year ended december   gross margin percentage was lower due to i inventory losses related to contamination issues in our phyzyme xp phytase enzyme manufacturing process  and ii incremental zero margin freight revenue and related costs incurred to meet customer ship dates 
both of these factors negatively impacted gross profit and resulted in a lower gross margin in during  we experienced a favorable product mix shift to products with lower production costs  such as fuelzyme alpha amylase 
for the reasons described above  we believe that product gross margin dollars is a better indication of performance than product gross margin percentage

table of contents share based compensation decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily related to the suspension of our employee stock purchase plan during the first quarter of and an overall decrease in equity awards granted since our merger with celunol corp in  partially offset by the tender offer option exchange which resulted in approximately million in additional expense during the year 
interest and other expense  net interest income on cash and short term investments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances during interest expense was million  net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration scale facility  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration facility 
our demonstration scale facility was placed in service in february  and as such  we ceased capitalizing interest on that date 
the increase in interest expense from the comparable periods in was primarily attributed to the decrease in capitalized interest partially offset by the decrease in notes principal outstanding from conversions 
total interest expense for the years ended december  and comprised of the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash accretion of debt discount non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash amortization of debt premium notes total equipment financing other capitalized interest total interest expense on october   we entered into an agreement with syngenta in connection with the completion of previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration 
as of the separation date  approximately million in deferred revenue was outstanding related to syngenta for unearned  prepaid research funding under the previous agreement 
the million was recognized as gain on contract settlement for the year ended december   as the amount represented cash received in excess of research labor hours incurred  for which we had not completed the revenue earning process 
loss on exchange of convertible notes in connection with the issuance of the notes  we exchanged million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
pursuant to current accounting rules  we recorded a non cash loss on the exchange of million  equal to the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the fair value of the notes and warrants issued 

table of contents gain on amendment of notes in connection with the amendment of the notes  the notes conversion price was reduced from to and the anti dilution protection included in the notes was changed from full ratchet anti dilution protection to  in most cases  a version of broad based weighted average anti dilution protection  subject to certain limitations 
pursuant to authoritative guidance  we determined that the amendment qualified as a liability extinguishment  and recorded a gain on the amendment of million  equal to the difference between the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative before and after the amendment 
gain on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative  warrants  the convertible hedge transaction in connection with our notes and notes compound embedded derivative are recorded as a derivative asset or liability and marked to market each balance sheet date 
the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as gain on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities 
we recorded a net gain of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  related to the change in fair value of our recorded derivative asset and liabilities 
gain loss on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the gain loss calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the shares of common stock delivered to the noteholders upon conversion 
the carrying value of the converted notes for the year ended december  was equal to the million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes and make whole payments 
the carrying value of the converted notes was equal to million which represented the difference between the principal converted of million and the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the converted notes and related make whole payments 
net income loss from discontinued operations as previously noted  on september   we completed the sale of the lc business to bp for a purchase price of million 
as such  the legacy lc business current and prior periods presented in this report have been reclassified to reflect the legacy lc business as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december  and  net loss from discontinued operations was million and million  including goodwill impairment charge of million 
during  we determined that the market value of our common stock and convertible debt was not adequate to support the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the june merger between diversa and celunol 
as a result  pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance we recorded a non cash charge of million in  representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in connection with the initial phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we formed galaxy as a special purpose entity 
we were considered the primary beneficiary of galaxy and consolidated its financial results 
in connection with the second phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we held a interest in vercipia  a special purpose entity 
we were considered the primary beneficiary of vercipia and consolidate its financial results 

table of contents as a result  our consolidated financial statements include a line item called noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
on our consolidated balance sheets  this line reflects bp s ownership of galaxy s and vercipia s equity 
this line item is reduced by bp s share of galaxy s and vercipia s losses  and increased by cash contributions made by bp 
bp s share of losses is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
both entities were sold to bp as part of the lc business sale on september  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  funding from strategic partners and government grants  the issuance of convertible debt  and product sales

assuming this occurs in  based on our current cash resources and operating plan  our existing working capital will not be sufficient to repurchase the and notes 
if we are unable to re finance our and notes  raise additional capital  we will need to defer restructure or significantly curtail our operations  issue equity in exchange for our and notes at substantial dilution to current stockholders  file for bankruptcy  or cease operations 
balance sheet our consolidated assets have decreased by million to million at december  from million at december   attributable primarily to the sale of our lc business  including our pilot plant and demonstration plant located in jennings  louisiana  to bp offset by an increase in cash for the proceeds of the sale of million  net of transaction costs 
our consolidated liabilities have decreased by million to million at december  from million at december   primarily attributable to the sale of our lc business to bp and the debt repurchase of million in principal of our and notes

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   including the principal and interest payments for our and notes  assuming such obligations are not redeemed pursuant to noteholder rights prior to maturity in april in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease manufacturing costs to fermic license and research agreements convertible debt notes notes total contractual obligations we lease approximately  square feet of office space in a building in cambridge  massachusetts 
the offices are leased to us under an operating lease with a term through december in connection with the sale of the lc business we completed on september   the majority of the space in the cambridge office was vacated and is no longer used 
additionally  on december   we publicly announced that we will be focusing all of our operations in san diego in the first quarter of and completely close our office in cambridge to better align us with the evolving needs of the business and the market 
the closure will be effective by the end of the first quarter as of december   all numbers reflected for the cambridge lease in the table above are presented on a gross obligation basis 
additionally  our facilities are currently located in san diego  california in space we sublease from bp free of rent for a period of up to two years through august  and therefore  no obligation is reflected in the table 
pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with fermic  we are obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice 
this commitment represents thirty months of rent at current committed capacity  which is the maximum capacity allowed under the agreement 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes for cash including any accrued and unpaid interest on april   april  and april  total obligations under the notes include approximately million including million due within one year in interest through maturity of the notes

interest payments on the notes may be made  at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  in shares of common stock  or interest shares  valued at the greater of the applicable conversion price in effect  which was as of december   or the average of the volume weighted stock price during a measurement period prior to the applicable interest payment date 

table of contents manufacturing and supply agreements we have a manufacturing agreement with fermic to provide us with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of enzyme products  pursuant to which we pay fermic a fixed monthly rent for minimum committed manufacturing capacity 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice 
as of december   under this agreement our minimum commitments to fermic are approximately million over the next two and a half years 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we fund  in whole or in part  capital expenditures for certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream processing of our enzyme products 
since inception through december   we have incurred costs of approximately million for property and equipment related to this agreement  of which million we funded in our ongoing strategy is to remove our manufacturing bottlenecks  increase manufacturing efficiencies  and remove manufacturing variability  in order to manufacture more product and reduce our average production cost per unit 
for much of  we limited our marketing activities in line with our manufacturing capabilities 
in order to improve our manufacturing capabilities  support growth  and reduce our average unit cost  we plan to make to million of additional capital investments at fermic during these investments should improve both our yield of enzymes and the profitability of our enzymes over time 
in  we contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme xp phytase 
our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme xp phytase contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume the right to manufacture phyzyme xp phytase 
if danisco were to exercise this right  we may experience excess capacity at fermic 
if danisco assumed the right to manufacture phyzyme xp phytase and we were unable to absorb or otherwise reduce the excess capacity at fermic with other products  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would give rise to additional material contractual obligations as of december  facility commitment all of our research and development  business development and corporate operations are conducted from a single facility in san diego  which we currently sublease from bp through august we are currently searching for an alternative facility in san diego 
we will likely need to build a new facility or retrofit an existing facility to accommodate our business  including the build out of new pilot fermentation recovery and automation labs 
the cost of the facility and the equipment required for the facility could require the expenditure of more than million over the next two years  which we expect to be financed through existing cash and or additional sources of capital 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  convertible senior notes  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by authoritative accounting guidance 
we generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue under current accounting rules 
in those instances where we have billed our customers or received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue  we include the amounts in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we generate revenue from research collaborations generally through funded research  up front fees to initiate research projects  fees for exclusivity in a field  and milestones 
we recognize revenue from research funding on a proportional performance basis  as research hours are incurred under each agreement 
we recognize fees to initiate research over the life of the project 
we recognize revenue from exclusivity fees over the period of exclusivity 
our collaborations often include contractual milestones 
when we achieve these milestones  we are entitled to payment  as defined by the underlying agreements 
we recognize revenue for milestone payments when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv our past research and development services  as well as our ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration  are charged at fees that are comparable to the fees that the we customarily charge for similar research and development services 
we recognize revenue from grants as related costs are incurred  as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying grant agreements 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of our inventory as we ship or deliver products  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from products sold through distributors or other third party arrangements upon shipment of the products  if the distributor has a right of return  provided that a the price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale  b the distributor s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of the products  c title and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment  d the distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by us  e we have no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products  and f future returns can be reasonably estimated 
for any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria  revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met 
we include revenue from our royalty on operating profit in product revenues on the statement of operations 
we recognize royalty on operating profit during the quarter in which such revenues are earned based on calculations provided by our partner 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our product revenues  including royalty on operating profit  through our agreements with danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty on operating profit based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of the royalty is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty on operating profit from quarter to quarter 
we have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme xp phytase 
under current accounting guidance  product manufactured for us by genencor is recognized on a net basis equal to the royalty on operating profit received from danisco  as all the following indicators of net revenue reporting are met i the third party is the obligor  ii the amount earned is fixed  and iii the third party maintains inventory risk  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalty on operating profit we currently recognize for phyzyme xp phytase we manufacture 

table of contents we sometimes enter into revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as we are able to determine a separate value for each element  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
share based compensation effective january   we calculate the fair value of all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  non restricted and restricted shares  and awards issued under our previous employee stock purchase plan  and amortize these fair values to share based compensation in the income statement over the respective vesting periods of the underlying awards 
share based compensation related to stock options includes the amortization of the fair value of options at the date of grant determined using the black scholes merton  or bsm valuation model 
we amortize the fair value of options to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards and awards under our previous espp plan on the date of grant using assumptions about volatility  expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield rate 
the expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and an analysis of our peers 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted  based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and an analysis of our peers 
the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and management s intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion 
we estimate the fair value of non restricted and restricted stock awards based upon the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we charge the fair value of non restricted awards to share based compensation upon grant 
we amortize the fair value of restricted awards to share based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards 
convertible debt and derivative accounting we adopted new guidance as issued on january  which significantly impacted the accounting for our notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt 
the liability component is measured so that the effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt reflects the issuer s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible debt 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
at inception  we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and  if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations 
we monitor  on an ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 

table of contents we accounted for the conversion of our notes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  which states that upon conversion the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the common stock delivered to the noteholders is recorded as a gain loss on debt extinguishment in our consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes authoritative accounting guidance includes an exception to the general principle of intraperiod tax allocations 
this exception requires that all items ie  extraordinary items  discontinued operations  and so forth  including items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations 
as a result of net book income from discontinued operations  we recorded an income tax expense from discontinued operations of million and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million during the year ended december   resulting in an overall annual income tax expense of zero 
effective in  we account for income taxes pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
we do not recognize an uncertain tax position as a deferred tax asset if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the updated authoritative guidance on january   and commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
as a result of adoption  we have recorded no additional tax liability 
as of december  we have not yet completed our analysis of our deferred tax assets for net operating losses and research and development credits 
as such  we have removed these amounts and the offsetting valuation allowance from our deferred tax assets 
the company is in the process of completing a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating loss and research and development credits and estimates a change of ownership has occurred that could significantly limit the company s ability to utilize net operating losses or credits in the future to as low as million per year over a year period 
until this analysis has been completed the company has removed the deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards from its deferred tax asset schedule and has recorded a corresponding decrease to their valuation allowance 
when the section analysis is completed  the company plans to update its unrecognized tax benefits 
the company expects the section analysis to be completed within the next six months 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our deferred tax assets at december  were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value and  if necessary  reduce the value by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the determination of the need for an allowance is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  as well as judgments  quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
recently issued accounting standards information with respect to recent accounting standards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
interest rate exposure as of december   all outstanding debt obligations of the company are comprised of fixed rate interest and  therefore  there is minimal interest rate exposure 
foreign currency exposure we engage third parties  including fermic  our contract manufacturing partner in mexico city  to provide various services 
from time to time certain of these services result in obligations that are denominated in other than us dollars 
additionally  under our manufacturing and sales agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme xp phytase inventory to danisco at our cost and  under a license agreement  receive a royalty equal to of danisco s profit from the sale of the product  as defined  when the product is sold to danisco s customer 
this profit share is denominated in other than us dollars  primarily danish krone  and is converted to us dollars upon payment 
consequently  our reported revenue may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
