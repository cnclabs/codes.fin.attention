item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors in part  item a and elsewhere in this form k 
overview dynamics research corporation  headquartered in andover  massachusetts  is a leading provider of innovative management consulting  engineering  and information technology services and solutions to federal and state governments 
our go to market strategy is sharply focused within each of four dimensions solutions 
we deliver high value differentiated solutions to our clients 
our five areas of differentiated expertise are business transformation  information technology  training and performance support  management services and engineering services 
we believe our solutions align well with the needs of our government customers today through improved efficiencies and effectiveness  procurement reform  transformational and technology based changes  and ongoing  changing security threats 
markets and customers 
we target markets  which based on long term market force drivers  have sustained government projected demand for services 
we select customers from the spectrum of federal government departments and agencies in our target growth markets with needs that well match the solutions we provide 
currently our target growth markets include homeland security  healthcare  cyber security  intelligence and financial regulatory reform 
in approximately of our revenue was derived from clients in these markets and selected high growth areas of defense such as unmanned aerial systems and force readiness and training 
our revenue derived from these markets grew over prime government and agency wide contracts 
we hold an enviable portfolio of government and agency wide multiple award schedule id iq task order contracts 
today  these types of contracts are the federal government s preferred means of procurement for services 
acquisitions 
we use acquisitions  funded through both operationally generated cash and leverage  to strengthen our position in our target growth markets 
during the second quarter of  we sold our metrigraphics business division which was classified as held for sale at december  and accounted for as a discontinued operation 
our financial results were restated to reflect the discontinuation of metrigraphics for all periods presented prior to the sale 
critical accounting policies and estimates there are specific business risks to the industries in which we operate 
these risks include estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact our assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant accounting areas particularly those that involve judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of some costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on our revenue and operating income 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method 
the risk on a fixed price contract is estimates of costs to complete the contract may exceed revenues on the contract 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can reliably be estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on a variety of factors  including previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract 
for all types of contracts  we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
unbilled receivables are the amounts of recoverable revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
unbilled receivables relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with the contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  indirect rate approvals or other reasons 
costs related to certain us government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts we expect to realize upon final settlement 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of kadix and other businesses  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 

table of contents we estimate fair value for our annual goodwill impairment test by employing different methodologies  including a comparison to comparable industry companies  discounted cash flows and market value  which are then weighted to arrive at an estimated fair value 
the determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value 
should the operating performance of our reporting unit change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change  this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting unit 
our discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary t o achieve the related revenues 
additionally  the discounted cash flow analysis factors in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
the market value factor is primarily driven by the underlying value of our common stock  which can vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as overall market conditions and our estimated future profitability 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 
our annual impairment test is based on several qualitative and quantitative factors 
principally  a significant and sustained decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions would increase the risk of impairment of recorded goodwill 
we operate in the government it consulting marketplace which has historically been characterized by high visibility of future revenue streams  profitability and generally consistent positive cash flows 
our federal government customer base mitigates against near term volatility in financial performance experienced by companies operating in other parts of the economy 
long term industry trends and other business considerations  such as those outlined in the risk factors section of our form k can have a favorable or unfavorable effect on future cash flows 
these trends and business considerations include our concentration of business with the federal government  competitive bidding for contracts  and the mix of contract types in which we enter 
we considered our low short term volatility  favorable long term industry trends  high visibility for future revenue and cash flow and stock price as context for the determination that disclosure of heightened risk relative to goodwill impairment was not necessary at the time of our filing 
as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of november   we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  we are unable to assure that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes tax provisions are completed based on the asset and liability method 
as part of our process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had a net deferred liability of million at december  compared to a million at december  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from these positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we review our tax positions on a quarterly basis and more frequently as facts surrounding tax positions change 
based on these future events  we may recognize uncertain tax positions or reverse current uncertain tax positions which would affect the statement of operations and or the balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required 

table of contents pension obligations accounting and reporting for our pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to determine the value of our pension obligations and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is employed to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of december   the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs was and  respectively 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical long term asset returns and consultation with outside investment advisors 
the weighted average expected rate of return for was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
if assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  our obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring us to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december  and  we recorded a pension liability of million and million  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet that represented the underfunded benefit obligation 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel 
amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 

table of contents results of operations operating results and results expressed as a percentage of total revenues are as follows year ended december  in millions revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating income loss interest expense  net other income  net provision benefit for income taxes gain loss on discontinued operations net income loss totals may not add due to rounding 
the percentage for provision benefit for income taxes relate to a percentage of income before provision for income taxes 
revenue total revenue increased by million  or in compared to  and million  or in compared to revenues were earned from the following sectors year ended december  in millions national defense and intelligence agencies homeland security federal civilian agencies total revenue from federal agencies state and local government agencies other total revenue totals may not add due to rounding 
federal agency revenue increased million  or in compared to  and million  or in compared to federal agency revenues derived from our target growth markets were the primary reason for the increase in total revenues in currently our target growth markets include homeland security  healthcare  cyber security  intelligence and financial regulatory reform 
in approximately of our revenue was derived from clients in these markets and selected high growth areas of defense such as unmanned aerial systems and force readiness and training 
our revenue derived from these markets grew over during  the increase in federal agency revenues from our target growth markets were partially offset by a loss of billable positions to the government s in sourcing and related cost reduction initiatives 
during  we lost billable positions to the government s in sourcing and related cost reduction initiatives 
while the department of defense has announced a discontinuation of in sourcing  we anticipate the in sourcing initiatives will continue  and these may result in additional in sourcing of an estimated positions in the first quarter of in total  we continue to project the total affect of the government s in sourcing initiative to exceed positions  equating to annualized reven ue of approximately million  of which approximately half was realized in results and the remainder is to be reflected in results 

table of contents the increase in federal agency revenue compared to was due a full year of kadix revenue  supplemented by new contracts and task orders received in the second half of and in revenue from federal agencies grew excluding the effect of acquisitions in compared with  which is calculated by adding the first seven months of kadix revenue of million to our reported federal agency revenue 
growth in our target markets in was partially offset by the roll off of a set aside contracts  lower air force small business set aside revenue under the consolidated acquisition of professional services contract and lower revenue related to the us navy trident missile program 
the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was due to the deployment of the state of tennessee child welfare system contract in september the decrease in compared to was due to the completion of the state of ohio contract in  partially offset by increased revenues from the state of tennessee contract which began in the second quarter of revenues from the state of tennessee contract were million in compared to million in and million in revenues by contract type as a percentage of revenues were as follows year ended december  fixed price  including service type contracts time and materials cost reimbursable prime contract sub contract prime contract revenues increased in compared to prior periods as a result of an increasing portion of contracts awarded under drc s agency wide multiple award schedule id iq contracts 
indefinite contract awards the preferred means by which the government procures services today is through indefinite contract awards  commonly referred as agency wide id iq contracts 
occasionally  these contracts are issued to a single provider but most often they are issued for multiple years to multiple vendors 
the majority of our revenue is derived from these contracts 
we hold a broad portfolio of these prime contracts  including the following market sponsoring agency m s contract name government wide general services administration m alliant government wide office of personnel management m training and management assistance tma homeland security department of homeland security m enterprise acquisition gateway to leading edge eagle homeland security department of homeland security m professional program management services solutions ppmss financial regulatory department of treasury m treasury information processing support services tipss iv financial regulatory federal deposit insurance corporation s business analysis management support services bamss healthcare tricare department of defense m evaluation  analysis  management support teams intelligence maryland procurement office s bajasands readiness army training and doctrine command m simulation training omnibus contract stoc ii readiness army research institute m research  development analysis in army training train ii readiness department of defense m logistics management support services lmss readiness us air force m enterprise integration services management netcents eism readiness us air force m design engineering support program desp ii 
table of contents the eagle  ppmss  bamss and desp ii contracts are currently under re competition for successor contract vehicles 
individual contracts and contract task orders  which are subject to re competition in total million in annual revenue 
we believe we are well positioned to win successor contracts in each circumstance 
however  the outcomes from the competitions remain uncertain  and there can be no assurance of award of successor contracts to drc 
backlog and bookings our backlog position was as follows year ended december  in millions backlog funded unfunded total funded bookings funded bookings generated a book to bill ratio of approximately to in and to in both and the ending funded backlog as of december   and covered approximately  and months of revenue  respectively 
we expect that substantially all of our funded backlog at december  will generate revenue during the year ending december  the funded backlog generally is subject to possible termination at the convenience of the contracting party 
contracts are generally funded on an annual basis or incrementally for shorter time periods 
gross profit our gross profit on revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in a gross margin of in  in and in the decrease in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to lower direct labor content of revenue which resulted primarily from the government s in sourcing initiative partially offset by indirect cost efficiencies including labor related and facilities efficiencies 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to a full year of business activity associated with kadix revenue 
the improvement in gross margin was due to the addition of higher margin services provided by the acquired kadix operations  improved labor utilization and a shift from subcontract work to prime contract work  partially offset by an increase in pension expense due to the decline in plan asset performance in we recorded severance costs of million  million and million in cost of revenue in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
during  selling  general and administrative expenses included a litigation provision of million 
excluding the litigation provision  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue would have been 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to lower legal fees  business development costs  facility costs and administrative staffing costs 
the decrease in compared to was due to the litigation provision recorded i n  partially offset by a full year of kadix selling  general and administrative costs and an increase in deferred compensation costs in amortization of intangible assets amortization expense  which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in amortization expense in compared to 
table of contents primarily relates to the intangible assets acquired from our acquisition of impact innovations group which was fully amortized in the third quarter of the increase in compared to primarily relates to a full year of amortization expense recorded for the acquisition of kadix 
we anticipate amortization expense of million 
interest expense  net we incurred net interest expense of million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower debt levels and interest rates during the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to a full year of interest expense associated with our term loan used to finance the kadix acquisition in we recorded approximately million of interest income in each of the three years ended in other income  net other income expense consists of our portion of earnings and losses in hmrtech  llc  a small disadvantaged business in which we own a interest  gains and losses realized from our deferred compensation plan and results from other non operating transactions  all of which were immaterial to our results 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million in and million in  and recorded an income tax benefit of million in the effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in  excluding the tax effect of million in related to the litigation provision 
on april   we received a tax refund of million related to tax deductions  which we recorded in the first quarter of the effective rate was favorably affected by an adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction in state tax expense associated with the filing of prior year tax returns 
loss on discontinued operations as of december   metrigraphics was classified as held for sale and accounted for as a discontinued operation 
effective july   we sold metrigraphics for consideration of million 
we recorded a gain from discontinued operation  net of taxes  of million in and a loss  net of taxes  of million and million in and  respectively 
shares used in computing earnings loss per share weighted average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in shares in compared to was due to the issuance of common stock  primarily through stock plan transactions 
the increase in shares in compared to was due to the net loss recorded in  which did not include the dilutive effect of stock options or unvested restricted stock 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are subject to trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  government payment practices and contractual matters 
our need for access to funds is dependent on future operating results  our growth and acquisition activity and external conditions 

table of contents we have evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term basis 
we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the short term 
cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expenditures  pay federal and state income taxes and fund the pension plan  if necessary 
to provide for long term liquidity  we believe we can generate substantial positive cash flow  as well as obtain additional capital  if necessary  from the use of subordinated debt or equity 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs 
we believe that selective acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we may acquire  from time to time  firms or properties that are aligned with our core capabilities and which complement our customer base 
we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic objectives  along with the possibility of utilizing the credit facility as a source of financing 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and million  respectively 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million during was primarily attributable to net earnings realized and collections on our contract receivables 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million and million in and  respectively 
net contract receivables were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
billed receivables decreased million and million in and  respectively 
unbilled receivables decreased million in and increased million in contract receivables days sales outstanding dso  was days at december  and days at december  federal business dso  which excludes the effect of state contracts  was days at december  and days at december  the states of ohio and tennessee had a combined contract receivable balance outstanding of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
our net deferred tax liability was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to changes in unbilled receivables  partially offset by changes in property and equipment  the timing of pension contributions and the usage of the state net operating loss 
during  we paid million in income taxes  net of million in refunds  compared to million in in july  we received million from a federal net operating loss carryback tax claim 
the irs has challenged the deferral of income for tax reporting purposes related to unbilled receivables including the applicability of a letter ruling issued by the irs to drc in january which granted us deferred tax treatment of the unbilled receivables 
this issue was elevated to the irs national office for determination 
on october   we received a notification of ruling from the irs national office 
this ruling provided clarification regarding the irs position relating to revenue recognition for tax purposes regarding our unbilled receivables 
during september  the irs completed its examination of our tax returns for through and issued a revenue agent report  which reduced the deferral of income for tax reporting purposes 
as a result we reclassified a pproximately million from deferred to current taxes payable 
the irs report also included an assessment of interest of million 
we have filed a protest with the irs to appeal the assessment 
we believe the appeal will be successful and have therefore made no provision for the interest associated with the assessment 
share based compensation was million in both and  and million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the vesting of executive long term incentive program shares in the second quarter of as of december  the total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was million which is expected to be amortized over approximately years  and the unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards was million which is expected to be amortized over approximately years 

table of contents non cash amortization expense of our acquired intangible assets was million in  million in and million in we anticipate that non cash expense for the amortization of intangible assets will decrease to approximately million in  excluding the addition of any acquisitions 
our defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the plan s underfunded status in was primarily attributable to favorable asset performance during the year and an increase in cash contributions to the plan during we recorded pension expense of million and million in and  respectively  compared to pension income of million in the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to favorable asset performance in and an increase in cash contributions to the plan during we contributed million to fund the pension plan in january and anticipate pension expense to be approximately million in investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of million during was primarily attributable to capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of metrigraphics 
net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in and million in capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in and compared to was primarily related to the move to our corporate headquarters in we expect discretionary capital expenditures in to be in the range of million to million 
during july  we sold metrigraphics for consideration of million  which consisted of million in cash and million in the form of a subordinated note 
interest on the subordinated note is payable quarterly and the repayment of principal is due in full in july  the maturity date of the subordinated note 
in august  we completed the acquisition of kadix 
the total purchase price of million included additional contingent consideration related to achievement of earnout objectives of million that was accrued at december  and paid in financing activities in december  drc s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program  which allows us to buy back up to  shares of our common stock through june  during  we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
the timing  price and amount of any repurchase will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
these repurchases may be made through the open market  including block purchases  or in private negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
the buyback will be funded through available cash balances and or borrowings  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
at december   there were  shares available to be repurchased under the program 
our term loan requires quarterly repayments of million and we expect operating cash flows to be sufficient to fund these repayments 
our swap agreement effectively fixes our interest rate on an initial notional amount of million of the term loan principal at swap fixed rate plus the current margin of throughout the term of the credit facility 
at december   the borrowing capacity available under our revolver was million 
the facility and swap agreements are more fully described in note and note  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
the company believes it has access to additional capital resources  from the use of subordinated debt or equity  as alternate sources of funding 
we are confident that our current resources are sufficient and we believe the possibility of needing additional financing resources for the continuation of current operations is remote 
at december   the company was in compliance with its loan covenants 
the company s most stringent financial covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
this covenant requires the company to maintain a ratio of 
table of contents adjusted consolidated ebitda to adjusted consolidated interest expense of not less than to 
this fixed charge coverage ratio is tested on a quarterly basis and is measured on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis 
the average daily borrowing on our revolver for was million at a weighted average interest rate of  compared to million at a weighted average interest rate of in and million at a weighted average interest rate of in during  the average outstanding balance of our term loan was million at a weighted average interest rate of compared to million at a weighted average interest rate of in and million outstanding for the last five months of at a weighted average interest rate of 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented repayments under the term loan of million  net payments of million under our revolver and payments of million for the repurchase of shares  partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through stock plan transactions 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented repayments under the term loan of million  partially offset by net borrowings of million under our revolver and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
during  net cash provided by financing activities of million represented net borrowings under the term loan of million and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions  partially offset by net repayments of million under our revolver 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not utilize or employ any off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december   defined as i an obligation under a guarantee contract with certain characteristics  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement  iii an obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument but for the fact that it is indexed to the issuer s stock and classified as shareholder equity or iv an obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following payments due by period less than two to four to one three five in millions total year years years thereafter long term debt payments interest payments operating lease payments total contractual obligation payments contractually obligated operating lease receipts totals may not add due to rounding 
the contractual amounts above related to interest payments does not include the portion of interest contractually due on our term loan principal balance that is not tied to the interest rate swap because those interest rates are not fixed 
the interest rate swap agreement effectively fixes half of the term loan s principal balance at an interest rate of  which includes the applicable margin of at december  
table of contents we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties of million as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
contingencies we are a party to litigation and other proceedings as referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
except as noted therein we do not presently believe it is likely that any of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our evaluation of the likelihood of expenditures related to these matters is subject to change in future periods  depending on then current events and circumstances  which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements are referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
impact of inflation and changing prices overall  inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
additionally  the terms of dod contracts  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in  are generally one year contracts and include salary increase factors for future years  reducing the potential impact of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolver and term loan  where interest payments are tied to either the libor or prime rate 
at december   the interest rate on our term loan was 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the floating interest rate risk on half of our outstanding term loan 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on half of our outstanding term loan at  which includes the applicable margin of at december  the blended interest rate of our term loan and swap agreement was at december  at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest expense as reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our potential loss over one year that w ould result in a hypothetical and instantaneous increase of one full percentage point in the interest rate on half of our term loan would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  historically our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we typically invest excess cash in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less with no exposure to market interest rates 
we have no significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign sales  which are nominal  are primarily denominated in us dollars
