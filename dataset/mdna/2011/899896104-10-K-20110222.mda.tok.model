the core businesses in all of these units performed very well mainly due to higher total and active sales forces 
of the emerging markets  russia had the most notable decline in local currency sales compared with  due to lower sales force activity  reflecting a more difficult consumer spending environment and the impact on sales and the sales force of the third quarter fires and heat wave in this market  along with more conservative ordering by the market s distributors in light of their cash flow 
the company s established market businesses were down percent in reported sales  including a positive million impact on the comparison from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

also  in  the company benefited from lower resin prices used in the manufacturing of tupperware products of about million 
there was also a million cost in  which did not recur in  to write down inventory in the brazil beauty business when the company reached a decision to begin selling beauty products in brazil through the tupperware sales force and cease operating its separate beauty business in brazil 
operating expenses delivery  sales and administrative expense ds a declined as a percentage of sales to percent in  compared with percent in the improvements in the ds a percentage in were mainly due to more efficient promotional spending and the leverage from higher sales volume due to the fixed nature of a portion of the costs included in this caption 
this was partially offset by additional marketing spending for continued brand building initiatives in the asia pacific segment 
ds a declined as a percentage of sales to percent in  compared with percent in contributing to the improvement in the ds a percentage in was a decrease in distribution costs due to lower fuel costs  lower promotional spending resulting from improved structures in promotional offers  and the benefits of expense savings action plans 
as noted above  in  the company began selling beauty products in brazil through its tupperware sales force rather than through a separate beauty business it had been operating 
this change contributed to the more favorable ds a ratio 
the company allocates corporate operating expenses to its reporting segments based upon estimated time spent related to those segments where a direct relationship is present and based upon segment revenue for general expenses 
the unallocated expenses reflect amounts unrelated to segment operations 
allocations are determined at the beginning of the year based upon estimated expenditures 
total unallocated expenses for increased million compared with  reflecting higher incentive and equity compensation due to the overall improved operating results  incremental audit fees in connection with the review of internal controls in selected emerging markets and variations in foreign exchange rates 
total unallocated expenses for increased million compared with  reflecting higher incentive and equity compensation due to the overall improved operating results of the company 
also the company modified one of its incentive plans in the latter part of to a stock based award  which no longer required the award to be remeasured at each reporting period 
prior to the modification  the company s stock price decreased resulting in lower incentive costs  however  as these awards are no longer remeasured and their expense was recorded straight line over the requisite service period in  there was an overall increase in incentive costs 
in february  the company also granted special stock option and restricted stock awards to its chief executive officer and chief operating officer  which did not occur in  impacting unallocated expenses 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company includes costs related to the distribution of its products in ds a expense 
as a result  the company s gross margin may not be comparable with other companies that include these costs in cost of products sold 

table of contents included in net income were pretax charges of million for re engineering and impairment charges  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
these charges are discussed in the re engineering costs section following 
the company s goodwill and intangible assets relate primarily to the december acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation and the october acquisition of beauticontrol 
the company conducts an annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets in the third quarter of each year  other than for beauticontrol where the annual valuation is performed in the second quarter  and in other quarters in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred 
the impairment assessment is completed by estimating the fair value of the reporting units and intangible assets and comparing these estimates with their carrying values 
in  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and a million impairment to the naturcare tradename 
these impairments resulted from benefits related to strategies implemented since the acquisition of these businesses in not occurring as quickly or significantly as had been projected 
also contributing to these impairments was an overall increase in the assumed discount rates used in the valuations 
although some improvements had been made in these businesses  the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flow of the nutrimetics and naturcare businesses in the second quarter of were below the company s projections used in its previous valuations  as was the forecast for growth in future periods 
in the second quarter of  the company also noted that financial results of the south african beauty business were not meeting the projections used in the annual valuation 
given the sensitivity of the valuations to changes in cash flows for these reporting units  the company performed interim impairment tests of tradenames and reporting units  reflecting reduced future forecasts in these markets  including the impact of the external environment 
the result of the interim impairment tests was to record tradename impairments of million for nutrimetics  million for naturcare and million for avroy shlain in the second quarter of in addition to the impairment of tradenames  the company also recognized impairments of goodwill of million and million relating to the nutrimetics and south african beauty reporting units  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the company completed annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units  other than beauticontrol  which was completed in the second quarter  noting no further impairment 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company subsequently decided it would begin selling certain of its swissgarde products in its avroy shlain beauty business in south africa  and to cease operating the swissgarde business in the other southern african countries in which it has been operating 
this is expected to have a significant impact on the swissgarde sales force  as well as decrease the breadth of the product line 
as a result of this decision  the company concluded that its intangible assets and goodwill were impaired 
hence  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million impairment to the swissgarde tradename  a million impairment related to its sales force intangible asset and a million impairment to goodwill relating to the south african beauty reporting unit 
the company continues its program to sell land for development near its orlando  florida headquarters which began in however  there were no land sales under this program in or due to negative developments in the real estate market including ramifications of the credit crisis in the united states

since the company began this program in  cumulative proceeds from these sales have totaled million and currently are expected to be up to million when the program is completed

in  the company recorded a pretax gain of million in insurance recoveries from the settlement of its claim from the fire at its south carolina manufacturing facility 
in  operating results were 
table of contents positively impacted by million of pretax gains in connection with the disposal of assets  including net insurance recoveries 
this included million of pretax gains from insurance recoveries on the south carolina facility fire

re engineering costs as the company continuously evaluates its operating structure in light of current business conditions and strives to maintain the most efficient possible structure  it periodically implements actions designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
these actions may result in re engineering costs related to facility downsizing and closure as well as related asset write downs and other costs that may be necessary in light of the revised operating landscape 
in addition  the company may recognize gains upon disposal of closed facilities or other activities directly related to its re engineering efforts 
over the past three years  the company has incurred such costs as detailed below that were included in the following income statement captions in millions re engineering and impairment charges delivery  sales and administrative expense cost of products sold total pretax re engineering costs the company recorded million in re engineering and impairment charges in primarily related to severance costs incurred in its argentina  australia  beauticontrol  france  greece  japan and mexico operations  mainly due to implementing changes in the businesses management structures  and million related to moving costs and the impairment of property  plant and equipment associated with the relocation of certain manufacturing facilities in japan

tax rate the effective tax rates for  and were  and percent  respectively 
the higher rate  in comparison to  was due to the higher level of nondeductible foreign goodwill impairment charges incurred in in addition  there were significant costs related to the impact of changes in mexican legislation and a revaluation of tax assets in the increase in the rate over reflected a shift in income towards jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates  and a lower level of foreign tax credit benefits 
the effective tax rates for  and are below the us statutory rate  reflecting the availability of excess foreign tax credits as well as lower foreign effective tax rates 
tax rates are affected by many factors  including the global mix of earnings  changes in tax legislation  acquisitions or dispositions as well as the tax characteristics of income 
the company is required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities  uncertain tax positions and assessments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets in determining the income tax provision 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits will ultimately be realized 
this assessment is based upon expectations of domestic operating and non operating results  foreign dividends and other foreign source income  as well as anticipated gains related to the company s future sales of land held for development near its orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits

also in  the company settled uncertain mexican tax positions with a payment of million million in tax and million in interest  which was subject to indemnification by a third party 
as a result  the company s unrecognized tax benefit decreased by million  and related accruals for interest and penalties decreased by million 
the company expects to settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that will result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount 
while the company does not currently expect any other material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to 
table of contents audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments which could also  in turn  impact the company s assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items 
net income for  operating income increased percent compared with  which included a percent positive impact on the comparison from stronger foreign exchange rates 
net income increased percent on a reported basis  and this included a positive percent impact from stronger foreign exchange rates

offsetting this amount  the company did not incur in the million in losses recorded in when it was operating a separate beauty business in brazil 
the beauty north america segment showed good improvement on a local currency basis  reflecting better value chain performance  which could not fully offset the negative impact of the mexican peso on the year over year comparison

excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  required debt payments and actual dividends paid up to million annually 
however  the credit agreement provides that cash may be used 
table of contents to repurchase shares using proceeds from stock option exercises 
it also provides that repurchases beyond those from the use of option proceeds are excluded from certain of the financial covenant calculations if the leverage ratio  as defined under the credit agreement  is and will remain below times and the other covenants in the agreement are met  which is currently the case 
the debt under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets  excluding real estate and capital stock of its domestic subsidiaries  plus a percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries

the continuing swap agreements  combined with a contractual spread dictated by the credit agreement  which was basis points as of december   gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on these borrowings 
the credit agreement contains covenants customary for similarly rated companies 
the financial covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio  a leverage ratio and an adjusted net worth requirement as defined in the agreement 
the covenant restrictions include adjusted covenant earnings and net worth measures 
as of december   and currently  the company has considerable leeway under its financial covenants  and expects to maintain compliance with its debt covenants through  however  economic conditions  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  lower than foreseen sales and profit or the occurrence of other events discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere could cause noncompliance 
the company monitors the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties  which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities 
furthermore  the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest  foreign currency rates  and the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties

the net debt obligations to capital ratio at the end of was percent  compared with percent at the end of net debt obligations are defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and capital is defined as net debt obligations plus shareholders equity 
the decrease in the ratio was primarily due to a higher level of cash at the end of  reflecting favorable operating results 
also contributing to the improvement in the ratio was an increase in equity from earnings  proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and the positive impact of foreign currency translation adjustments  partially offset by dividends paid and share repurchases during the year

stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  related to the exercise of stock options 
the higher amount of stock option proceeds during was due primarily to an increase in the company s stock price and the holders decisions  including the remaining time before the options year terms would have ended

as of december  the company s total gross unrecognized tax positions were million 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
b capital commitments represent signed agreements as of december  on relatively minor capital projects in process in the company s brazil  indonesia and south africa units

application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand and selling price 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management or the estimate of selling prices of inventory on hand decreases  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of these total assets  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon future operating and non operating income generated from the united states businesses of tupperware and beauticontrol  as well as foreign dividends and other foreign source income 
also  expected gains related to future sales of land around the company s orlando  florida headquarters would result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
as of december  and december   the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a benefit of million to the provision related to interest and penalties from the reversal of certain accruals made in previous years 
during  million of previously unrecognized foreign tax credit benefits were recognized as a result of the issuance of clarifying tax guidance and favorable tax opinions received 
in addition  gross unrecognized tax benefit decreased by million as a result of favorable audit settlements in several foreign jurisdictions 
during  the company settled uncertain mexican tax positions with a payment of million million in tax and million in interest  which was subject to indemnification by a third party 
as a result  the company s unrecognized tax benefit decreased by million and related accruals for interest and penalties were decreased by million 
during the year  the accrual for uncertain tax positions also increased for the positions being taken in various tax filings 
the accrual is also impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents the company expects to settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that will result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amounts 
while the company does not currently expect any other material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments which could also in turn impact the company s assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items 
promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october and the sara lee direct selling businesses in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the former sara lee direct selling units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that leads the company to determine that a triggering event for impairment testing has occurred  a test is completed at that time 
the impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure for a goodwill impairment loss 
this step revalues all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to their current fair values and then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the valuation of goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of operations of the six individual reporting units identified 
fair value of the reporting units is determined by the company using either the income approach or a combination of the income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach percent 
the income approach  or discounted cash flow approach  requires significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows  including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates as to the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this valuation is the projection of operating cash flows  as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the company s cash flow model uses forecasts for periods of about years and a terminal value 
the significant assumptions for these forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from to percent with an average growth rate of percent 
the growth rates are determined by reviewing historical results of these units and the historical results of other of the company s business units that are similar to those of the reporting units  along with the expected contribution 
table of contents from growth strategies implemented in the units 
terminal values for all reporting units were calculated using a long term growth rate of percent 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units in  the company applied discount rates to its reporting units projected cash flows ranging from to percent 
the discount rate at the high end of this range was for the south african and latin american reporting units due to higher country specific risk 
the market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar to tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples 
the publicly traded companies used in the market approach were selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods  beauty products and or companies using a direct selling distribution method 
the resulting multiples were then applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and tradenames acquired in conjunction with its purchase of the sara lee direct selling businesses 
the fair value of the company s tradenames was determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
in this method  the value of the asset is calculated by selecting royalty rates which estimate the amount a company would be willing to pay for the use of the asset 
these rates were applied to the company s projected revenue  tax affected and discounted to present value using an appropriate rate 
royalty rates used were selected by reviewing comparable trademark licensing agreements in the market  and a range from to percent was used in in estimating the fair value of the tradenames  the company also applied a discount rate ranging from to percent  and revenue growth ranging from to percent  with an average growth rate of percent  and a long term terminal growth rate of percent 
similar to the rates used in valuing the goodwill  the discount rates towards the high end of the range related to tradenames located in areas with higher country risks  such as revenue generated in the company s argentina and philippines markets under the fuller tradename  its south africa market under the avroy shlain tradename and its uruguay market under the nuvo tradename 
in prior years  the company recorded impairment charges related to its naturcare  nutrimetics and south african businesses  in part  due to the fact that current and forecasted future results of operations were below its prior projections 
this resulted from benefits related to strategies implemented since the acquisition of these businesses in not occurring as quickly or significantly as had been projected 
also contributing to the previous impairments was an overall increase to the assumed discount rates used in the valuations 
in  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename  a million impairment to the naturcare tradename and a million impairment to the avroy shlain tradename 
in addition to the impairment of tradenames  the company also recognized impairments of goodwill of million and million relating to the nutrimetics and south african beauty reporting units  respectively 
in  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and a million impairment to the naturcare tradename 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units and tradenames  other than beauticontrol which was completed in the second quarter  and determined there was no further impairment 
the company subsequently decided it would cease operating its swissgarde unit in southern africa as a separate business and instead would begin selling certain of its products through its avroy shlain beauty business in south africa 
this is expected to have a significant impact on the swissgarde sales force 
as a result of this decision  the company concluded that its intangible assets and goodwill were impaired and recorded in a million impairment to the swissgarde tradename  a million impairment related to the sales force intangible asset and a million impairment to goodwill relating to the south african beauty reporting unit 
with the goodwill impairments recorded for the nutrimetics and south african reporting units  these units are at a higher risk of additional impairments in future periods if changes in certain assumptions occur 
this is also the case for the nutrimetics  avroy shlain and naturcare tradename values  as the fair value in these cases was set equal to carrying value in the second quarter of the fair value of the fuller mexico  naturcare and beauticontrol reporting units and the nuvo tradename exceeded the carrying value by over percent at the last valuation date resulting in a lower risk that these assets could be impaired in future periods 
the fair value of the fuller tradename exceeded its carrying value by almost percent making future impairments less likely to occur 
the company s fuller latin america reporting unit showed an excess of 
table of contents percent over carrying value  which could indicate a higher risk of future impairments 
given the sensitivity of the valuations to changes in cash flow or market multiples  the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the company s performance 
actual results below forecasted results or a decrease in the forecasted results of the company s business plan or changes in discount rates could also result in an impairment charge  as could changes in market characteristics including additional declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
further impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income 
additionally  as of december  the company had million included on its consolidated balance sheets as the value of acquired sales forces 
the estimated annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the product formulation asset recorded as part of the acquisition was fully amortized 
retirement obligations pensions the company records pension costs and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans using the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this guidance requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the retirement obligations and costs of providing benefits under the company s pension plans involves various factors  including several assumptions 
the company believes the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate and government bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension expense for the company s us and foreign plans was as follows discount rate us plans foreign plans the company has established strategic asset allocation percentage targets for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return 
the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  in an effort to improve return and manage risk 
the estimated rate of return is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
the expected rate of return assumptions used by the company for its us and foreign plans were as follows expected rate of return us plans foreign plans the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  in millions impact on pension expense discount rate change by basis points expected rate of return on plan assets change by basis points 
table of contents other post retirement benefits the company accounts for its post retirement benefit plan in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of various assumptions  including a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plan 
the discount rate assumptions used by the company to determine other post retirement benefit expense were percent  percent and percent for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
a change in discount rate of basis points would not be material 
the following are the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the company health care trend rates initial health care cost trend ultimate health care cost trend year ultimate trend rate achieved the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on post retirement benefit obligation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers  the price is fixed  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent distributors or a member of its independent sales force  and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options  which requires the input of assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation expense for these awards  the company is also required to estimate the extent to which options will be forfeited prior to vesting forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to the previously recorded amounts 
impact of inflation inflation  as measured by consumer price indices  has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates  except for argentina and venezuela

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  and the currencies in which it borrows 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s borrowings under its current credit agreement carry a variable interest rate  but the agreement requires the company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least percent of total debt during the term of the agreement 
consequently  when the credit agreement was initiated in september  the company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in under the terms of these swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent  plus the spread under the credit agreement which was basis points as of december  these interest rate swaps  effectively fix the interest rate on million of the company s million of outstanding term loans 
the company does pay a variable rate on the remaining million of term loans and any outstanding revolver borrowings  although if short term interest rates varied by percent with all other variables remaining constant  the company s annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted 
a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project  in any meaningful way  the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
the company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales  profit or cash flow generated by its operations 
while the company s hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
for the years ended december  and december   the cash flow impact of these currency hedges was an outflow of million and an inflow of million  respectively 
the us dollar equivalent of the company s most significant net open foreign currency hedge positions as of december  were to sell swiss francs million  turkish lira million and japanese yen 
table of contents and to buy euros million  indonesian rupiah  and south korean won million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company s outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net payable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which upon settlement could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 
a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations 
the risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the determination of fair value for the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action  as appropriate and possible  to further manage its counterparty credit risk 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and  in particular  the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of most tupperware products  and the company estimates that cost of sales will include about million for the cost of resin in the tupperware brand products it produces 
the company uses many different kinds of resins in its products 
about two thirds of its resins are polyolefins simple chemical structure  easily refined from oil  and as such  the price of these is strongly affected by the underlying price of oil 
the remaining one third of its resins are more highly engineered  where the price of oil plays a less direct role in determining price 
with a comparable product mix  a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the company s annual cost of sales by about million compared with the prior year 
for  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produced was negatively impacted by about million in local currency due to resin cost changes as compared with for the full year of  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produces will be negatively impacted by about million  on a local currency basis  due to resin cost changes as compared with the company partially manages its risk associated with rising resin costs by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation in each market  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering into forward contracts for resin is not practical or cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process 
included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals  the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial or residential developments in the orlando real estate market or obtaining financing and general economic conditions  such as interest rate increases 
the company s land sale program has been negatively impacted by the drivers and ramifications of the credit crisis and real estate market conditions in the united states  which have delayed the completion of this program
