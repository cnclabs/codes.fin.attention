overview we are a leading global provider of technology enabled asset protection solutions used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy  industrial and public infrastructure 
we combine industry leading products and technologies  expertise in mechanical integrity mi and non destructive testing ndt services and proprietary data analysis software to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of customized solutions  ranging from routine inspections to complex  plant wide asset integrity assessments and management 
these mission critical solutions enhance our customers ability to extend the useful life of their assets  increase productivity  minimize repair costs  comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations  manage risk and avoid catastrophic disasters 
given the role our services play in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of infrastructure  we have historically provided a majority of our services to our customers on a regular  recurring basis 
we serve a global customer base of companies with asset intensive infrastructure  including companies in the oil and gas  fossil and nuclear power  public infrastructure  chemicals  aerospace and defense  transportation  primary metals and metalworking  pharmaceuticals and food processing industries 
during fiscal  we provided our asset protection solutions to approximately  customers 
as of may   we had approximately  employees  including approximately phd s and other degreed engineers and  certified technicians  in approximately offices across countries 
we have established long term relationships as a critical solutions provider to many leading companies in our target markets 
our current principal market is the oil and gas industry  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
for the last several years  we have focused on introducing our advanced asset protection solutions to our customers using proprietary  technology enabled software and testing instruments  including those developed by our products and systems segment 
during this period  the demand for outsourced asset protection solutions  in general  has increased  creating demand from which our entire industry has benefited 
we have experienced a compounded annual growth rate cagr for revenue of over the last three fiscal years  including the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
we believe further growth can be realized in all of our target markets 
concurrent with this growth  we have worked to build our infrastructure to profitably absorb additional growth and have made a number of small acquisitions in an effort to leverage our fixed costs  grow our base of experienced  certified personnel  expand our product and technical capabilities and increase our geographical reach 
we have increased our capabilities and the size of our customer base through the development of applied technologies and managed support services  organic growth and the integration of acquired companies 
these acquisitions have provided us with additional products  technologies  resources and customers that we believe will enhance our competitive advantages over our competition 
the global economy continues to be fragile 
global financial markets continue to experience uncertainty  including tightened liquidity and credit availability  relatively low consumer confidence  slower economic growth  persistently high unemployment rates  volatile currency exchange rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability 
however  we believe these conditions have allowed us to capitalize on an opportunity to selectively hire new talented individuals that otherwise might not have been available to us  to acquire and develop new technologies in order to aggressively expand our proprietary portfolio of customized solutions  and to make acquisitions of complementary businesses at reasonable valuations 
basis of presentation consolidated results of operations our three segments are services 
this segment provides asset protection solutions primarily in north america with the largest concentration in the united states  consisting primarily of non destructive testing and inspection services that are used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy  industrial and public infrastructure 

table of contents products and systems 
this segment designs  manufactures  sells  installs and services our asset protection products and systems  including equipment and instrumentation  predominantly in the united states 
international 
this segment offers services  products and systems similar to those of our other segments to global markets  principally in europe  the middle east  africa  asia and south america  but not to customers in china and south korea  which are served by our products and systems segment 
general corporate services  including accounting  audit  legal  payroll  information technology  human resources and contract management  are provided to the segments and are reported as intersegment transactions within corporate and eliminations 
sales to the international segment from the products and systems segment and subsequent sales by the international segment of the same items are recorded and reflected in the operating performance of both segments 
additionally  engineering charges and royalty fees charged to the services and international segments by the products and systems segment are reflected in the operating performance of each segment 
all such intersegment transactions are eliminated in corporate and eliminations 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
segment income from operations is evaluated based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer  the chief operating decision maker  to assess the performance of each business in a given period and to make decisions as to resource allocations 
in connection with that assessment  the chief executive officer may exclude items such as charges for stock based compensation and certain other acquisition related charges and balances  technology and product development costs  certain gains and losses from dispositions  and litigation settlements or other charges 
certain general and administrative costs such as human resources  information technology and training are allocated to the segments 
segment income from operations also excludes interest and other financial charges and income taxes 
corporate and other assets are comprised principally of cash  deposits  property  plant and equipment  domestic deferred taxes  deferred charges and other assets 
corporate loss from operations consists of depreciation on the corporate office facilities and equipment  administrative charges related to corporate personnel and other charges that cannot be readily identified for allocation to a particular segment 
statement of operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
revenues our revenues are generated by sales of our services  products and systems 
the majority of our revenues are derived under time and materials contracts for specified asset protection services on a project by project basis 
the duration of our projects vary depending on their scope 
some of our projects last from a few weeks to a few months  but the more significant projects can last for more than a year and can require long term deployment of substantial personnel  equipment and resources 
the start date of our projects can be postponed or delayed and the duration of our projects can be shortened or increased due to a variety of factors beyond our control 
in addition to the timing of these projects and the seasonality of our business  the amount and origination of our revenues often vary from period to period 
a percentage of our revenues are usually attributable to recurring work from our existing customers 
although our top ten customers are responsible for a large percentage of our revenues  we generate our revenues from most of these customers by providing asset protection solutions to a number of their business locations 
decisions regarding the purchase of our solutions by these customers are made either on a corporate basis or on a location by location basis 
also included in our revenues are software license fees and product sales  as well as an estimate for potential sales returns and customer allowances 
revenues under our time and materials services contracts are based on the hours of service we provide our customers at negotiated rates  plus any actual costs of materials and other direct expenses that we incur on the project  which may include markups 
because these expenses  such as travel and lodging or subcontracted services  can change significantly from project to project  changes in our revenues may not be indicative of business trends 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues includes our direct compensation and related benefits to support our sales  together with reimbursable costs  materials consumed or used in manufacturing our products and certain overhead costs  such as non billable time  equipment rentals  fringe benefits and repair and maintenance 

table of contents depreciation included in gross profit our depreciation represents the expense charge for our capitalized assets 
depending on the nature of the original item capitalized  these depreciation expenses are reported in one of two places in our statement of operations 
depreciation used in determining gross profit is directly related to our revenues and primarily relates to depreciation of equipment used for the delivery of our asset protection solutions and to a lesser extent depreciation of manufacturing equipment 
we also have other depreciation primarily related to our corporate headquarters which is included in deriving our income from operations as discussed below 
gross profit our gross profit equals our revenues less our cost of revenues and attributed depreciation 
our gross profit  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  can vary based on our volume  sales mix  actual manufacturing costs and our utilization of labor 
as a result  gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter 
for instance  the seasonality of our business can cause our gross profit to decline during traditionally slower first and third quarters when we incur labor costs without any corresponding revenues 
under our time and materials contracts  we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project 
our profit margins on time and materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates 
in recent years  there has been an increasing demand for asset protection solutions and at times  a limited supply of certified technicians 
accordingly  we may experience increases in our cost of labor in our services segment 
the customers of our services segment have been aware of these supply constraints and generally have  to some extent  accepted corresponding price increases for our services 
however  in the current economic environment we have experienced certain pricing pressures from customers and we are uncertain whether our ability to increase prices for our services will continue 
in our products and systems segment  our ability to increase prices for any product or system to offset associated cost increases is based principally on the extent to which it incorporates our proprietary technology 
we believe our efforts to develop and offer our customer s value added proprietary solutions instead of commodity type products help us  in part  to resist margin erosion 
our international segment offers services  products and systems similar to those of our other segments  so our ability to increase prices in this segment as costs increase is determined by the same factors affecting the pricing of our other segments  and the relative mix of services  products and systems it provides in the applicable period 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised primarily of expenses of our sales and marketing operations  field location administrative costs and our corporate headquarters related to our executive  general management  finance  accounting and administrative functions and legal fees and expenses 
these costs can vary based on our volume of business or as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives such as training 
the largest single category is salaries and related costs 
in the near term  we expect these expenses to increase as we support the growth of our business and expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company 
we also expect that our sg a expenses will decline as a percentage of our revenues  particularly over the long term 
research and engineering research and engineering expense consists primarily of engineering salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products  materials and outside services used in our process and product development activities primarily in our products and systems segment 
other research and development is conducted in our services segment by various billable personnel and our management on a collaborative basis 
these costs are not separated and are included in cost of revenues 
specific development costs on software are capitalized and amortized in our depreciation and amortization included in our income from operations 
from time to time  we receive minor grants or contracts for paid research which are recorded in our revenues with the related costs included in cost of revenues 
we expect to continue our investment in research and engineering activities and anticipate that our associated expense will increase in absolute terms in the future as we hire additional personnel and increase research and engineering activity 
however  as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and engineering expense to decline over the long term 
depreciation and amortization included in income from operations our depreciation and amortization used in deriving our income from operations represents the expense charge for our capitalized assets  and primarily relates to buildings and improvements  including our corporate headquarters  office furniture  equipment  intangibles and other assets acquired as part of our acquisitions of other businesses 
the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  non competition agreements  customer lists and trade names  while the other assets acquired are primarily machinery and 
table of contents equipment 
to the extent we ascribe value to identifiable intangible assets that have finite lives  we amortize those values over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
fixed assets acquired are depreciated over their useful lives and charged to cost of revenues 
such depreciation and amortization expense  although non cash  directly impacts our results of operations 
it is difficult to predict with any precision the amount of expense we may record relating to acquired intangible and other assets 
income from operations our income from operations is our gross profit less our sg a expenses  research and engineering  depreciation and amortization  and reserve for legal settlements included in income from operations 
we refer to our income from operations as a percentage of our revenues as our operating margin 
interest expense our interest expense consists primarily of interest paid to our lenders under our credit agreement and our capital leases 
also included is the interest on subordinated notes issued as part of our acquisitions and interest incurred related to interest rate swap contracts  when applicable 
income taxes income tax expense varies as a function of pre tax income and the level of non deductible expenses  such as certain amounts of meals and entertainment expense  valuation allowances and other permanent differences 
as of may  we had approximately million of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
available to offset state taxable income in future years 
these state nols will expire  if not utilized  at varying dates beginning in depending on the laws of each state 
at may   the company has recorded a valuation allowance of less than million against certain state deferred income tax assets based on its assessment that the respective deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly over the next few years due to many variables including the amount and future geographic distribution of our pre tax income  changes resulting from our acquisition strategy  and increases or decreases in our permanent differences 
noncontrolling interest  net of taxes the noncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests of other stockholders in our international subsidiaries  where ownership is not permitted or de minimis local ownership is helpful for business purposes 
consolidated results of operations fiscal  and our revenues  gross profit  income from operations and net income for fiscal  and were as follows for the years ended may  in thousands revenues gross profit gross profit income from operations operating income as percentage of revenues interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of taxes net income attributable to mistras group  inc net income attributable to mistras group  inc as a percentage of revenues 
table of contents our growth rates for fiscal  and  respectively  were as follows for the years ended may  in thousands revenue growth growth over prior year comprised of of organic growth of acquisition growth foreign exchange increase decrease fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
our revenues  by segment for fiscal  and  were as follows years ended may  in thousands revenues services products and systems international corporate and eliminations revenues by operating segment include intercompany transactions  which are eliminated in corporate and eliminations 
revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of growth in all our segments 
for fiscal and fiscal  we estimate that our organic growth rate  as compared to growth driven by acquisitions  was approximately and  respectively 
in fiscal  we estimate that organic growth by segment was approximately for our products and systems segment  for our services segment and for our international segment 
this organic growth was driven by an increase in demand for our inspection services coupled with an increase in seasonal turn around maintenance activity from our run and maintain or evergreen contracts at oil refineries 
in fiscal  we estimate that growth from acquisitions was million  or approximately  compared to million  or  in fiscal we completed five acquisitions in fiscal compared to three acquisitions in fiscal and five acquisitions in fiscal  increasing our capabilities and adding to our base of qualified technicians 
we continued to experience growth in many of our target markets in fiscal as compared to fiscal the largest dollar increase was attributable to customers in the global oil and gas market on several new and existing projects  including an increase in our portfolio of run and maintain contracts and new work obtained due to our acquisitions 
overall  our revenues from the oil and gas market grew approximately in fiscal and provided approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively  with the largest increase coming from the petrochemical section of the oil and gas industry 
in addition  we also experienced high growth in several of our other target markets outside of oil and gas  including industrial  and aerospace and defense markets 
taken as a group  all target markets other than oil and gas grew approximately over the prior year 
our top ten customers represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal our largest customer  bp  accounted for approximately of our revenues in both fiscal and no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal 
table of contents gross profit 
as a percentage of revenues  our gross profit in total and its components for fiscal  and  were as follows for the years ended may  in thousands gross profit gross profit comprised of revenues cost of revenues depreciation total gross profit increase decrease from prior year our gross profit  by segment for fiscal  and  was as follows years ended may  in thousands gross profit services products and systems international corporate and eliminations our gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our gross profit was approximately in fiscal and cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues was approximately in fiscal and depreciation expense included in the determination of gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
also included in cost of revenues is an increase to our provision for slow moving inventory of million in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the increase in our fiscal revenues  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained at approximately 
this is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of revenues generated during the year  as well as better utilization of direct labor 
for example  revenues from the oil and gas industry increased approximately during fiscal and represented approximately of total revenues 
the revenue from this industry often has lower gross margins than other industries because these contracts tend to be longer and have a high concentration of traditional ndt services 
as a result of these lower margins revenue growth in this category tends to decrease overall gross margins 
offsetting the impact of higher revenues from the oil and gas industry was revenue growth in all other industries of approximately in fiscal advanced ndt services  which have higher margins than traditional ndt services  increased more than during fiscal and now represents approximately of our services segment revenues compared to approximately in fiscal our revenue growth is also attributable to sales from new contracts  which drive market share growth but are competitive from a pricing perspective in the short term 
while these competitive pricing contracts remain a focus of many of our new and existing services segment customers  we were able to improve our gross profit as a percentage of revenues by focusing on utilization rates of our service technicians and other controllable costs of revenues 
these costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to approximately during fiscal from approximately during fiscal historically  by introducing more advanced ndt tools to our services segment customers  margin enhancement follows 
another contributing factor for the decreases in fiscal and compared to was the continued economic downturn in fiscal and we experienced revenue declines in shop work and industrial markets  which have higher margins than our traditional ndt services 
during fiscal  certain of our customers managed project activity and turnarounds differently than in the past  stopping or changing planned work schedules more abruptly 
this created 
table of contents inefficiencies in the planning and utilization of labor 
in fiscal we continued to develop several new specialties within our asset protection solutions by hiring and training new employees and creating centers of excellence  including centers for industrial tube and off shore oil rig platform inspections and new pipeline construction 
this investment in our technicians to gain future market share  however  contributes to non billable labor until these markets develop 
income from operations 
our income from operations  by segment for fiscal  and  was as follows years ended may  income from operations services products and systems international corporate and eliminations our income from operations of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our income from operations increased to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were approximately in fiscal and fiscal our sg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in expense was primarily due to the cost of additional salary and other infrastructure costs to support our growth in revenues  including the addition of new locations and personnel in connection with our acquisitions 
overall  our sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses of million over the prior year attributed to normal compensation increases  including incentive compensation  as well as our investment in additional management and corporate staff to support our growth including support of the development of new and existing centers of excellence 
our recent acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the total increase in sg a expenses 
other increases in sg a expenses included stock compensation costs of approximately million  professional service and consulting costs of approximately million  and a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in our provision for bad debts of approximately million 
income from operations was also negatively impacted by a legal provision of million in fiscal as compared to a reversal of a legal provision of million in fiscal depreciation and amortization included in the determination of income from operations for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  each being of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal interest expense related primarily to the maturity of our interest rate swap agreement in november net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of taxes 
the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal relates primarily to a net loss from diapac  our subsidiary in russia  offset by an increase in net income of our brazilian subsidiary  pasa 
in fiscal  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily attributable to net income from diapac and pasa 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the impact of permanent tax differences and higher foreign taxes offset by a decrease in state taxes and a decrease relating to our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal was million  or approximately of revenues  an increase of million over net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal  which was million  or approximately of revenues 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of our revenue growth  and lower interest and research and engineering expenses  offset by higher sg a expenses and increases to our legal provision and provision for income taxes 
net income attributable to common shareholders 
net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal was million  or approximately of revenues  a decrease of million when compared to fiscal  which was million  or approximately of revenues 
in fiscal  net income attributable to common shareholders included a fair market value 
table of contents adjustment of million to reduce the preferred stock value to the benefit of common shareholders 
all of the preferred shares outstanding as of our ipo in october converted to common stock 
offsetting the impact of the fair market value adjustment in fiscal was an overall increase in net income attributable to mistras group  inc of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of growth in all our segments 
for fiscal and fiscal  we estimate that our organic growth rate  as compared to growth driven by acquisitions  was approximately and  respectively 
in fiscal  we estimate that organic growth by segment was for our services segment  for our products and systems segment and for our international segment 
this organic growth was the result of continued demand for our asset protection solutions  including growth from new and existing customers 
in fiscal  we estimate that growth from acquisitions was million  or  compared to million  or  in fiscal we completed three acquisitions in fiscal compared to five acquisitions in fiscal  and seven acquisitions in fiscal  increasing our capabilities and adding to our base of qualified technicians 
despite the prolonged downturn in the global economy  we continued to experience growth in many of our target markets in fiscal as compared to fiscal the largest dollar increase was attributable to customers in the global oil and gas market on several new and existing projects  including an increase in our portfolio of run and maintain contracts and new work obtained due to our acquisitions 
overall the oil and gas market provided approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
within this market  we provide services to refineries  as well as midstream and upstream customers  petrochemical and other industry segments 
refineries are currently the largest area of this market and represent approximately of our total revenues 
as of may  and  we serviced approximately and  respectively  of the us refineries and and  respectively  of refineries producing  or more barrels per day  but this only represents approximately of the world s refineries 
we also experienced high growth in several of our other target markets  including chemical  fossil and nuclear power 
these increases were partially offset by declines in capital projects  turnaround work and reduced pipeline  aerospace and industrial parts inspection activity and the completion of certain projects as compared to fiscal our top ten customers represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal our largest customer accounted for approximately and of our revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal gross profit 
our gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our gross profit was approximately and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal depreciation expense included in determining gross profit for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively  each being of revenues 
despite the increase in our fiscal revenues  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a lower margin product mix of sales for our services segment 
the services segment generated the largest portion of the revenue increase and our gross margins on revenues from our services segment are generally lower than that of our other segments 
in addition  we increased our market share through new customer contracts and through acquisitions  which often leads to lower margins in the near term until such time as we can fully integrate these acquisitions into our business model and deliver a stronger mix of advanced asset protection solutions to our customers  which generally carry higher margins 
income from operations 
our income from operations of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our income from operations increased to approximately compared to approximately in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses for fiscal were approximately compared to approximately for fiscal our sg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the increase in expense is primarily due to the cost of additional salary and other infrastructure costs to support our growth in revenues  including the addition of new locations and personnel in connection with our acquisitions 
our recent acquisitions accounted for approximately million of total increase in sg a expenses 
stock compensation costs increased approximately million in fiscal over fiscal in addition  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million  net of estimated recoveries  related to the bankruptcy of one of our customers 
other increases in our sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses over the previous year attributed to normal salary increases as well as our investment in additional management and corporate staff 
a significant portion of 
table of contents these increases as well as other increases in cost of revenues supported our development of additional centers of excellence 
our professional fees also increased in fiscal  which related primarily to increased costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  including our continued efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  as well as certain costs associated with our initial public offering in october depreciation and amortization included in the determination of income from operations for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  each being of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding during the year 
just prior to our ipo in october  we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of approximately million  which was subsequently repaid with the proceeds of the offering 
additionally  we incurred expense related to the market rate adjustments to our interest rate swaps  as the fixed rate on these swaps was higher than market rates during both annual periods 
the total interest expense adjustments for these swap arrangements for fiscal and fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of taxes 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to an increase in net income of our brazilian subsidiary  pasa  offset by a decrease in net income from diapac  our subsidiary in russia 
in fiscal  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily attributable to an increase in net income from diapac 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the impact of permanent tax differences and an adjustment to our liabilities related to uncertain tax provisions offset by higher state taxes 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal was million  or of revenues  an increase of million over net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal  which was million  or of revenues 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of our revenue growth and lower interest expense  offset by higher sg a expenses and research and engineering expenses and an increase to our provision for income taxes 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc was also positively impacted by the reversal of a legal provision of in fiscal compared to a legal provision of million in fiscal related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal was million  an increase of million when compared to fiscal which was a net loss of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the conversion of all of our preferred shares outstanding to common stock  million  as a result of our ipo in october segment results for fiscal  and segment discussions that follow provide supplemental information regarding the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our business segments 

table of contents services segment selected financial information for the services segment was as follows for fiscal  and years ended may  in thousands services segment revenues cost of revenues depreciation gross profit gross profit as a of segment revenue income from operations income from operations as of segment revenue total depreciation and amortization revenues 
over the last three years  the largest increase in our total revenues was from our services segment 
our services segment revenues had a cagr of during this period with annual increases in fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of prior year segment revenues  these increases were approximately  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our services revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to organic growth of approximately  and growth from acquisitions of approximately 
the increased sales activity was driven by base growth in manpower requirements  turn around activities inside our evergreen contracts and several new multi year contracts we entered into this year 
the industries contributing to this growth were oil and gas  chemical and power generation with the largest growth in dollars coming from the oil and gas industry  in both the downstream and midstream segments 
customers in the oil and gas industry accounted for approximately and of our services segment revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the three year cagr from this target market has been approximately 
we also have experienced double digit cagrs in most of our other target markets due to strong demand  the addition of new customers and increasing revenues from existing customers 
we increased our revenues to existing customers by increasing our penetration on existing service offerings and providing different types of asset protection solutions 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our services segment revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer  bp  represented approximately of revenues for our services segment in fiscal  and revenues from bp  as well as most of our larger oil and gas customers  are generated from numerous contracts and at multiple sites 
in fiscal  our services revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal we estimate million of the increase in revenues are from acquisitions compared to million in the prior year 
the balance of the growth came from several new multi year contracts  particularly in the form of evergreen accounts 
also contributing to our revenue growth was an increase in turnaround projects and other large scale projects that had been postponed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in several of our non energy related markets  we did experience slowing in our revenue growth because of the continuation of the economic downturn 
across all markets  we experienced pricing pressure  especially on new business and existing contract renewals 
gross profit 
our services segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of services revenues  an increase of million over fiscal  which was million  or of revenues 
the modest growth in gross margin  an increase of from the previous year  is considered positive due to the pricing pressure from large master service agreements with larger oil and gas customers that drive our base revenues up while being awarded at competitive pricing 
while competitive pricing contracts remain a focus of many of our services segment customers  we were able to improve our gross profit as a percentage of revenues by focusing on utilization rates of our service technicians and other controllable costs of revenues 
in fiscal our unbilled labor expense  as a percentage of segment revenues  decreased approximately basis points compared to fiscal cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues was and in fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal and depreciation expense included in gross profit was million and million respectively  each representing approximately of revenues 
we continued to invest in 
table of contents additional field test equipment and fleet vehicles  which generate depreciation expense  to support our growth and reduce other operating costs  such as repairs and maintenance 
our services gross profit for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of segment revenues  an increase of million over fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal however  relates to an increase in revenues from new multi year contracts that often start with providing traditional ndt services  which generally produce lower margins  until such time as we are engaged in a stronger mix of advanced asset protection solutions  which carry higher margins 
this was coupled with an expansion of our new centers of excellence and training which represents our continued investment in our technicians and our ability to provide new ndt solutions  but contributes to non billable time 
in fiscal  depreciation expense included gross profit increased million  a increase  representing both new assets acquired and increased depreciation from our acquired businesses 
during fiscal  certain of our customers managed project activity and turnarounds differently than in the past  stopping or changing planned work schedules more abruptly or frequently than in the past  creating inefficiencies in the planning and utilization of labor 
compared to fiscal  our number of certified technicians and related fringe benefit costs  particularly healthcare costs  increased 
income from operations 
our income from operations from our services segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment revenues  our income from operations increased to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal sg a expenses in our services segment increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  each representing approximately of segment revenues 
the services segment sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses of million over the prior year attributed to normal compensation increases  including incentive compensation  and the cost of additional salary to support our growth in revenues  including the addition of new locations and personnel in connection with our acquisitions 
our acquisitions in fiscal accounted for approximately million of our sg a expenses 
other increases in sg a expenses in fiscal included professional service and consulting costs of approximately million 
the year over year decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales  approximately  reflects the benefit of increased leverage of our cost base resulting from higher sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization expense used in determining income from operations was approximately million and million in fiscal fiscal  respectively  each being of revenues 
in fiscal  significantly higher segment revenues  coupled with decreases in legal settlement costs and bad debt expense were the primary drivers for the increase in our operating margin 
sg a expenses in our services segment for fiscal compared to fiscal increased million  or 
this increase primarily related to higher operating costs of million primarily payroll expense and a corresponding increase in occupancy costs for rents and utilities to support our acquisitions and overall growth 
in addition  we continued our investment in new training  safety and quality programs to support new customer offerings and infrastructure 
these increases were offset by a net decrease of million in our provision for bad debt relating primarily to a large customer filing for bankruptcy in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense used in determining income from operations was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  each being of revenues

the products and systems segment also experienced growth in revenues over the last three years 
revenues were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively

the largest customer for this segment is our international segment  which distributes these products primarily to our european  and asian and north african markets  or  to a lesser extent  uses the products in their field testing and engineering services 
other larger markets representing approximately of total segment revenues have been research and test laboratories  nuclear and fossil power  and industrial and aerospace companies 
our products and systems revenue increase of million in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from an acquisition completed in fiscal  which accounted for million  or  of the increase 
revenues also increased by an aggregate of million in our acoustic emission  vibrametrics and engineering product lines  offset by a million decrease in our ndt product line 
in fiscal  our products and systems revenues increased million compared to fiscal due to an increase in acoustic emission revenues and several large ndt orders received during fiscal we also continued our expansion of our sales distribution channels by hiring additional industry focused sales representatives to continue to drive sales growth 
offsetting these increases in revenues were decreases in our vibrametrics and customer service product lines 
gross profit 
our products and systems segment gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment revenues  our gross profit was approximately and  in fiscal and  respectively 
our recent acquisition contributed million in gross profit for fiscal depreciation expense used in determining gross profit for fiscal and was million  or of segment revenues  and million  or of segment revenues  respectively 
overall  the gross margin percentage decreased by in fiscal as a result of an increase to our provision for slow moving inventory of approximately million 
excluding this increase in the inventory reserve  the gross profit percentage for fiscal would have reflected a margin of approximately of revenues 
the gross profit in our products and systems segment can fluctuate depending on volume and product mix 
for example  our ultrasonic ndt solutions require custom product engineering to automatically inspect a wide range of parts varying in size and shape 
this may include a small part from a jet engine to a major component of a boeing jet 
the inspection of these large components requires the fabrication of large structures to facilitate testing  for which we generally use subcontractors and procure large  expensive components 
the utilization of subcontractors and high cost parts for this work often yields lower gross margins 
for fiscal our products and systems segment gross profit of million increased million  or  compared to fiscal our segment gross profit as a percentage of revenues for fiscal and was and  respectively 
depreciation expense used in determining gross profit for fiscal and was million  or of segment revenues  and million  or of segment revenues  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit percentage was attributable to sales of higher margin products and several costs cutting initiatives implemented during the year

our international segment revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to organic growth of approximately and acquisition growth of approximately 
for the last three fiscal years  the international segment revenues  including currency fluctuations  had a cagr of  with annual increases of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from customers in the oil and gas and chemicals markets have comprised approximately  and of our international segment revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
most of this business is centered in major oil refineries in europe and south america 
other revenues are more widely distributed including infrastructure  industrial  manufacturing and other testing companies  research centers and universities 

table of contents our international segment contributed million to our revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  we estimate the organic segment growth was approximately 
in fiscal  we had no segment growth attributable to acquisitions 
currency fluctuations in fiscal caused by the strengthening of the us dollar resulted in million in lower revenues  most of this variance occurring in the last half of fiscal million of our overall segment growth was from services we provided to a major oil and gas customer in brazil and an aggregate of million was from the united kingdom  the netherlands and india  offset by million decrease in revenue from a large contract in russia and a million decrease in revenues in france 
gross profit 
our segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of segment revenues  an increase of million when compared to fiscal which was million  or of segment revenues 
the decrease in gross profit margin is a result of fewer overall acoustic emission product sales  which have a higher margin profile  an increase in more traditional ndt services  which carry lower margins  and an increase in reimbursable expenses  for which we receive only modest margins 
our segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of segment revenues  a decrease of million when compared to fiscal which was million  or of segment revenues

our sg a expenses for fiscal and were million  or of segment revenues  and million  or of segment revenues  respectively 
the overall decrease in our operating income from fiscal is primarily attributable to lower profitability at our russian and french subsidiaries 
corporate and eliminations the elimination in revenues and cost of revenues primarily relates to the elimination in consolidation of revenues from sales of our products and systems segment to the international segment 
the other major item in the corporate and eliminations grouping are the general and administrative costs not allocated to the other segments 
these costs primarily include those for non segment management  accounting and auditing  acquisition transactional costs  stock compensation expense and certain other costs 
as a percentage of our total revenues  these costs have generally remained constant over the last three fiscal years  consisting of  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses in and primarily related to higher compensation and additional staff  audit and accounting fees and other general increases in expense at our corporate offices 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have primarily funded our operations through cash provided from operations  bank borrowings  stock offerings and capital lease financing transactions 
we have used these proceeds to fund our operations  develop our technology  expand our sales and marketing efforts to new markets and acquire small companies or assets  primarily to add certified technicians and enhance our capabilities and geographic reach 
in october  we raised approximately million in net proceeds through our ipo  which we subsequently used to repay our bank borrowings under our credit facility and to increase our cash and cash equivalents 
in may  we raised approximately million in net proceeds through a secondary offering of our common stock  which we used to repay our bank borrowings and

cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal cash purchases of property  plant and equipment were million and were primarily related to equipment used by our technicians 
cash used in investing activities also included our acquisition of three asset protection businesses for cash payments aggregating million 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  a decrease of million from fiscal in may  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of share 
the company sold  shares and  shares were sold by a selling stockholder 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from the secondary stock offering of approximately million  and net borrowings under our credit facility of million 
these proceeds were offset by repayments of million related to our capital lease obligations and other long term debt 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  an increase of million from fiscal in october  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  providing net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriters commissions and other expenses

cash balance and credit facility borrowings as of may   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and available borrowing capacity of million under our current revolving credit facility 
our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were million as of may  we finance our operations primarily through our existing cash balances  cash collected from operations  bank borrowings and capital lease financing 
we believe these sources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na  jpmorgan chase bank  na  td bank  na and capital one  na  which provided for a million term loan and a million secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the agreement were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness from our former credit facility and to fund acquisitions 
in october  we repaid the outstanding principal balance of the term loan and the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility using the proceeds from our ipo 
credit extended under the term loan may not be re borrowed under the current credit agreement 
credit extended under the revolving credit facility may re borrowed at any time 
borrowings made under the revolving credit facility are payable on july  in december  we signed an amendment to our current credit agreement that  among other things  adjusted certain affirmative and negative covenants including delivery of financial statements  the minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio  the procedures for obtaining lender approval in acquisitions and the removal of the minimum ebitda requirement 
under the amended agreement  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the libor or base rate  at our option  plus an applicable libor margin ranging from to  or base rate margin ranging from to  and a market disruption increase of between and  if the lenders determine it applicable 
as of may   the interest rate for the borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 
the credit agreement also contains financial and other covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  create liens  make investments and certain capital expenditures  incur more indebtedness  merge or consolidate  acquire other companies  make dispositions of property  pay dividends and make distributions to stockholders  enter into a new line of business  enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into burdensome agreements 
the agreement s financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio  and a funded debt leverage ratio  all as defined in the credit agreement 
there is a provision in the credit facility that requires us to repay of the immediately preceding fiscal year s free cash flow if our ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is greater than a specified amount on or before october each year 
as of may   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  which we continuously monitor 
liquidity and capital resources outlook future sources of cash we expect our future sources of cash to include cash flow from operations  cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and cash borrowed from leasing companies to purchase equipment and fleet service vehicles 
our revolving credit facility is available for cash advances required for working capital and for letters of credit to support our operations 
to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we expect primarily to rely on cash generated from our operating activities 
we are currently funding our acquisitions through our available cash  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and seller notes 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to approximately million of securities  including shares of common stock and preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and units 
accordingly  we may also obtain capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination of both 
as of august   there were no outstanding borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility 

table of contents future uses of cash we expect our future uses of cash will primarily be for acquisitions  international expansion  purchases or manufacture of field testing equipment to support growth  additional investments in technology and software products and the replacement of existing assets and equipment used in our operations 
we often make purchases to support new sources of revenues  particularly in our services segment 
in addition  we have certain equipment replacement needs  including our fleet vehicles 
we historically spend approximately to of our total revenues on capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  and expect to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash and lease financing 
our cash capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for fiscal  and were approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
in october  we entered into an agreement for the construction of a new operations and training facility that will consolidate our presence in the houston  texas metro area 
this facility will serve as our gulf region headquarters and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal total costs  including construction and land  are expected to be approximately million 
our anticipated acquisitions may also require capital 
for example  subsequent to may   we made three acquisitions with an initial cash outlay of approximately million 
in some cases  additional equipment will be needed to upgrade the capabilities of these acquired companies 
in addition  our future acquisition and capital spending may increase as we aggressively pursue growth opportunities 
other investments in infrastructure  training and software may also be required to match our growth  but we plan to continue using a disciplined approach to building our business 
in addition  we will use cash to fund our operating leases  capital leases and long term debt repayment and various other obligations  including the commitments discussed in the table below  as they arise 
we also expect to use cash to support our working capital requirements for our operations  particularly in the event of further growth and due to the impacts of seasonality on our business 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments  in addition to those related to our long term debt discussed below  consist of obligations under facility leases for office space and equipment leases 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of may  in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond fiscal long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations contingent consideration obligations total includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the leases 
long term debt listed in the table above consists primarily of seller notes payable in connection with our acquisitions 
in addition to the above  we have certain acquisition related contingent payments that may become payable if certain financial measures  as defined in each respective agreement  are achieved 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our more significant estimates include the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  the impairment of long lived assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory obsolescence  and reserves for self insured workers compensation and health benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described below and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this item of this annual report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue recognition policies for the various sources of revenues are as follows services the company predominantly derives revenues by providing its services on a time and material basis and recognizes revenues when services are rendered 
at the end of any reporting period  there may be earned but unbilled revenues that are accrued 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are reflected as deferred revenues 
software revenues from the sale of perpetual licenses are recognized upon the delivery and acceptance of the software 
revenues from term licenses are recognized ratably over the period of the license 
revenues from maintenance  unspecified upgrades and technical support are recognized ratably over the period such items are delivered 
for multiple element arrangement software contracts that include non software elements  and where the software is essential to the functionality of the non software elements collectively referred to as software multiple element arrangements  the company applies the rules as noted below 
products revenues from product sales are recognized when risk of loss and title passes to the customer  which is generally upon product delivery 
the exceptions to this accounting treatment would be for multiple element arrangements described below or those situations where specialized installation or customer acceptance is required 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are reflected as deferred revenues 
percentage of completion a portion of the company s revenues are generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from several months to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting revenues are recognized as work is performed 
the percentage of completion at any point in time is based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the percentage of completion is then applied to the total contract revenue to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in the period 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct materials  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as 
table of contents indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
multiple element arrangements the company occasionally enters into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of services  software  and hardware 
under current financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  the company utilizes vendor specific objective evidence to determine whether the multiple elements can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered item has value on a standalone basis  and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  if the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  then revenues are deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
effective june   the company will adopt updated guidance from the fasb that will require the allocation of revenue in multiple element arrangements to separate units of accounting based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other first party evidence is not available  see recent accounting pronouncements 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter using a two step process 
the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing  we have identified our reporting units as our operating segments 
all of our segments have goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach valuation model  specifically the quoted price method  and an income approach valuation model  specifically discounted cash flows 
our discounted cash flow analysis incorporates the following key assumptions growth projections  our weighted average costs of capital  future capital expenditures and tax rates 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions and methodologies used for valuing goodwill since the prior year 
there was million and million of goodwill at may  and  respectively 
the fair value of our reporting units significantly exceeds the carrying value of these reporting units for fiscal and accordingly  there have been no impairments of goodwill 
there were no impairment indicators present in the reporting units in fiscal a material negative change in our key assumptions would need to occur for our step one tests to indicate an impairment 
intangible assets are recorded at cost  with finite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization periodically to determine if any adverse condition exists or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or change in useful life 
if impairment exists  and it is determined that there is no recoverability  an impairment charge is recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  the company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flow analysis or a comparison to fair values of similar assets 
we had million and million in net property  plant and equipment as of may  and  respectively  and did not record any impairment charges in the two fiscal years ended on those dates 
long lived assets  net outside of the us totaled million and million as of may  and  respectively 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
this process requires that we assess temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets resulting from differing treatment between book and tax of certain items  such as depreciation 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
as of may  and  we had net deferred income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
with the exception of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets 
we currently do not believe there are other outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur with regard to income taxes that would have a material impact on our fiscal and financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu  which amends asc  revenue recognition  to require companies to allocate the overall consideration in multiple element arrangements to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price 
this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect a significant impact on our financial statements when the guidance is adopted in fiscal in april  the fasb issued accounting standards updates asu  which amends asc  revenue recognition 
asu provides guidance on applying the milestone method to milestone payments for achieving specified performance measure when those payments are related to uncertain future events limited to transactions involving research and development 
entities can make an accounting policy election to recognize arrangement consideration received for achieving specified performance measures during the period in which the milestones are achieved  provided certain criteria are met 
this guidance is effective prospectively for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect a significant impact on our financial statements when the guidance is adopted in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at may  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in bank deposits  money market funds and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in fiscal  our interest income would not have been materially affected 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure  particularly the euro  british pound sterling  brazilian real  russian ruble  japanese yen  canadian dollar and the indian rupee  arises primarily from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in british pound sterling and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these 
table of contents items has not changed in their original currency 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
a change in the average us dollar exchange rates for fiscal would cause a change in consolidated operating income of approximately million 
we may consider entering into hedging or forward exchange contracts in the future 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices
