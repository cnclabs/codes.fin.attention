item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
business overview we research  develop and commercialize innovative technologies in three primary areas of focus test measurement  sensing  and instrumentation  secure computing and communications  and healthcare 
our business model is designed to accelerate the process of bringing new and innovative products to market 
we use our in house technical expertise across a range of technologies to perform applied research services on government funded projects and also for corporate customers in the fiber optic sensing area 
we continue to invest in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
we are organized into two business segments  our technology development segment and our products and licensing segment 
our technology development segment  which includes our secure computing and communications group that we refer to as scc  performs applied research for government funded projects and comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
most of the government funding in the part of our technology development segment outside of scc is derived from the small business innovation research  or sbir  program coordinated by the us small business administration  or sba 
our sbir research is focused on technological areas with commercial potential  and we strive to commercialize any resulting scientific advancements 
our scc group provides innovative solutions designed to secure critical technologies within us government systems  including the protection of deployed hardware and software systems and the communications between them 
scc both conducts applied research and provides services to the government in this area 
scc s revenue is primarily derived from non sbir us government contracts and purchase orders 
scc s revenues have grown substantially over the last several years  a trend that we expect to continue as the government increases spending on cyber security initiatives 
our technology development segment also performs applied research in the areas of sensing and materials 
our products and licensing segment focuses on fiber optic test and measurement  sensing and instrumentation products and also conducts applied research in the fiber optic sensing area for both corporate and government customers 
the products and licensing segment also commercializes healthcare products 
our product and licensing revenues represented approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we generate revenues through technology development services provided under contractual arrangements  product sales  product development under contractual relationships and license fees 
our technology development segment revenues have historically accounted for a large portion of our total revenues  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our technology development revenues  however  decreased from million in to million in and further decreased to million in this decline in revenues corresponded with a drop in the rate at which we received new research contract awards contemporaneously with our chapter reorganization in and early within our technology development segment  some groups appear to be continuing to experience program win rates below their historical averages  while other groups  most notably scc and our optical systems group  are seeing significant growth in new programs  creating an offsetting effect when considering total revenues for this segment 
we expect scc and the optical systems group to continue to grow in 
table of contents within the technology development segment  we have historically had a backlog of contracts for which work has been scheduled  but for which a specified portion of work has not yet been completed 
we define backlog as the dollar amount of obligations payable to us under negotiated contracts upon completion of a specified portion of work that has not yet been completed  exclusive of revenues previously recognized for work already performed under these contracts  if any 
total backlog includes funded backlog  which is the amount for which money has been directly authorized by the us congress and for which a purchase order has been received by a commercial customer  and unfunded backlog  representing firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog 
the approximate value of our technology development backlog was million at december   compared to million at december  revenues from product sales currently represent a smaller portion of our total revenues  and  historically  we have derived most of these revenues from the sales of our sensing systems and products that make use of light transmitting optical fibers  or fiber optics 
we continue to invest in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
although we have been successful in licensing certain technology in past years  we do not expect license revenues to represent a significant portion of future revenues 
over time  however  we do intend to gradually increase such revenues 
in the near term  we expect revenues from product sales and product development to be primarily in areas associated with our fiber optic instrumentation and test and measurement platforms 
in the long term  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger portion of our total revenues and that as we develop and commercialize new products  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant net loss for was primarily attributable to the costs incurred with respect to our litigation with hansen and subsequent chapter reorganization 
we settled our litigation and emerged from bankruptcy in january and  accordingly  we did not incur significant reorganization or related litigation costs in we expect to continue to incur increasing expenses as we expand our business  including expenses for research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
we may also grow our business in part through acquisitions of additional companies and complementary technologies  which could cause us to incur transaction expenses  amortization or write offs of intangible assets and other acquisition related expenses 
as a result  we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses could be substantial 
there was a rapid softening of the economy and tightening of the financial markets in the second half of that continued into this slowing of the economy has reduced the financial capacities of our customers and possibly our potential customers  thereby slowing spending on the products and services we provide 
the outlook for the economy for remains uncertain 
chapter reorganization and settlement with hansen on july   we filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
during the period from the filing date until january   the date we emerged from bankruptcy  we operated as a debtor in possession 
as a result of these chapter filings  actions to collect pre petition indebtedness and the pending hansen litigation were stayed 
in addition  under the bankruptcy code we had the right to assume or reject executory contracts  including real estate leases  employment contracts  personal property leases  service contracts and other unexpired executory pre petition contracts  subject to court approval 
we did not reject any such contracts in our chapter plan as confirmed by the court 
our plan of reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on january   and we emerged from bankruptcy on that date 

table of contents in december we entered into a settlement agreement with hansen  which reduced our liability with respect to our outstanding litigation to million 
as part of the settlement  in january we issued to hansen a million secured promissory note  approximately million shares of our common stock and a warrant entitling hansen to purchase  until january   a number of shares of our common stock as necessary for hansen to maintain a ownership interest in our common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
we also entered into a supply and development agreement with hansen as well as certain license agreements  and we entered into an amendment to our supply and development agreement with intuitive surgical which  among other things  amended the license agreement with intuitive to conform the license to the agreement with hansen 
the hansen litigation  including settlement efforts  resulted in significant legal expenses and related costs that are included in operating expenses for the year ended december  the chapter reorganization also resulted in significant legal expenses and related costs that are included in reorganization expenses for the year ended december  while we incurred certain expenses for both our chapter reorganization and the hansen litigation during the year ended december   these amounts were not material 
description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues we generate revenues from technology development  product sales and commercial product development and licensing activities 
we derive technology development revenues from providing research and development services to third parties  including government entities  academic institutions and corporations  and from achieving milestones established by some of these contracts and in collaboration agreements 
in general  we complete contracted research over periods ranging from six months to three years  and recognize these revenues over the life of the contract as costs are incurred or upon the achievement of certain milestones built into the contracts 
our technology development revenues represented approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our product and license revenues reflect amounts that we receive from sales of our products or development of products for third parties  as well as fees paid to us in connection with licenses or sublicenses of certain patents and other intellectual property  and represented approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues associated with technology development revenues consists of costs associated with performing the related research activities including direct labor  amounts paid to subcontractors and overhead allocated to technology development activities 
cost of revenues associated with product sales and license revenues consists of license fees for use of certain technologies  product manufacturing costs including all direct material and direct labor costs  amounts paid to our contract manufacturers  manufacturing  shipping and handling  provisions for product warranties  and inventory obsolescence  as well as overhead allocated to each of these activities 
operating expense operating expense consists of selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as expenses related to research  development and engineering  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets 
these expenses also include compensation for employees in executive and operational functions including certain non cash charges related to expenses from option grants  facilities costs  professional fees  salaries  commissions  travel expense and related benefits of personnel engaged in sales  product management and marketing activities  costs of marketing programs and promotional materials  salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel 
table of contents engaged in our own research and development beyond the scope and activities of our technology development segment  product development activities not provided under contracts with third parties  and overhead costs related to these activities 
litigation reserve as further described elsewhere in this report  in april as part of our litigation with hansen  a jury found in favor of hansen on certain of its claims against us and awarded a verdict for million against us 
we established a litigation reserve for this amount on our financial statements pending final resolution of the matter  which was recorded as other expense during the first quarter of in january  we concluded the settlement of our litigation with hansen and issued to hansen a secured promissory note in the principal amount of million as well as  shares of our common stock  with a fair value of approximately million  based on the closing price of our common stock on january  therefore  in the fourth quarter of we adjusted the prior litigation reserve downward to million 
this adjustment was recorded on our statement of operations as a reduction of operating expenses during the fourth quarter of interest income expense in  we entered into a million debt facility with silicon valley bank 
at december   a million term loan was outstanding under this facility 
on july   we repaid the outstanding balance of the term loan and terminated the credit facility 
in february  we entered into a new line of credit facility with silicon valley bank with a borrowing capacity of million 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the line of credit 
during and  interest expense included interest accrued on our outstanding bank credit facilities  as well as interest incurred with respect to our capital lease obligations 
during  we also incurred interest costs associated with our senior convertible notes issued to carilion with outstanding principal of million as of december  these notes were converted into shares of newly designated series a preferred stock during january interest income includes amounts earned on our cash deposits with financial institutions 
reorganization costs reorganization costs of approximately million in our statement of operations for the year ended december  consist of legal fees  claims processing and other costs directly associated with our chapter proceedings 
we emerged from bankruptcy in january and incurred approximately  in related reorganization costs for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates technology development revenues we perform research and development for us federal government agencies  educational institutions and commercial organizations 
we recognize revenue under research contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectability of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fixed fee representing the profit negotiated between us and the 
table of contents contracting agency 
revenue from cost reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates plus other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportional performance method and involve a specified number of deliverables  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the cost of the deliverables compared to the cost of all deliverables included in the contract as this method more accurately measures performance under these arrangements 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the development and delivery of a specific prototype or product  revenue is recognized based upon the percentage of completion method 
our contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectability of the contract price  we consider our previous experience with our customers  communication with our customers regarding funding status and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of normal management processes  facts may change  causing revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the underlying bases for estimating our contract research revenues are measurable expenses  such as labor  subcontractor costs and materials  and data that are updated on a regular basis for purposes of preparing our cost estimates 
our research contracts generally have a period of performance of six to months  and our estimates of contract costs have historically been consistent with actual results 
revisions in these estimates between accounting periods to reflect changing facts and circumstances have not had a material impact on our operating results  and we do not expect future changes in these estimates to be material 
whether certain costs under government contracts are allowable is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 
product and licensing revenues we recognize revenue relating to our product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we evaluate product sales that are a part of multiple element revenue arrangements to determine whether separate units of accounting exist  and we follow appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
for multi element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product s functionality  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 

table of contents our process for determining esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key factors considered in developing the esps include prices charged by us for similar offerings  our historical pricing practices  the nature of the deliverables  and the relative esp of all of the deliverables as compared to the total selling price of the product 
we may also consider  when appropriate  the impact of other products and services  on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing our esps income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we record on our balance sheet 
management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  management considers factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years  whether carry back is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce their net carrying value 
as we assess our projections of future taxable income or other factors that may impact our ability to generate taxable income in future periods  our estimate of the required valuation allowance may change  which could have a material impact on future earnings or losses 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we establish a liability at the time we determine it is probable we will be required to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
these liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust this provision  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established liabilities as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
due to differences between federal and state tax law  and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  certain items are included in the tax return at different times than when those items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return 
some differences  such as depreciation expense  reverse over time and create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense based upon the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of the grant 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to value any awards granted 
we amortize stock based compensation for such awards on a straight line basis over the related service period of the awards taking into account the effects of the employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
to compute the volatility used in this model  we use the lifetime volatility of our common stock 

table of contents long lived and intangible assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
results of operations the following table shows information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  revenues technology development revenues product revenues total revenues cost of revenues technology development costs product costs total cost of revenues gross profit operating expense operating loss total other income expense  net loss before reorganization items and income tax reorganization costs loss before income taxes income tax expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease of  or  from total revenues of million for the year ended december  our technology development segment revenue decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our activities in this segment were adversely affected by our chapter reorganization  which resulted in the loss of some awards for development contracts and significant delays in the receipt of other contract awards and the potential revenue from those awards 
we also experienced a drop in the rate at which we received new research contract awards contemporaneously with our chapter reorganization in and early our products and licensing segment revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
product sales revenue increased by to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   while revenues in this segment relating to product development activities decreased slightly 
table of contents to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  during both years  product development activities included work under our arrangements with intuitive and hansen  as well as arrangements with a number of governmental entities 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease primarily resulted from a decline in direct labor hours and other direct costs associated with a reduction or slowing in awards for new long term development projects during our reorganization in the latter half of product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  from million to million  largely attributable to the increase in product sales during compared to operating expense operating expense decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a large part of the decrease in operating expense was approximately million incurred in with respect to the litigation settlement with hansen  as well as million in professional fees and other costs associated with that litigation incurred during  and the million non cash impairment charge associated with certain of our intangible assets 
professional fees and other litigation costs incurred during were approximately share based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over share based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  we account for options granted at fair value on the date of grant and then recognize the compensation expense over the applicable vesting period of the option 
this increase is primarily due to the stock options granted in january to three new non employee directors and to existing directors in recognition of their service during our reorganization in  as well as stock options granted in may upon the re election of another non employee director 
these stock options granted to non employee directors result in relatively higher annual compensation expense than those generally granted to employees  due to the fact they will vest over months rather than months 
our research  development  and engineering expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease was a million decrease in expenses our nanomaterials group and the introduction of two new products in our products group  the obr and ova in early for which research  development and engineering expenses had been incurred in prior years 
interest and other income expense our net interest expense for the year ended december  was  down from  for the year ended december  during  we incurred interest expense on our million bank loan into july  as well as interest on the convertible promissory notes issued to carilion 
during  the carilion notes were converted into stock  and we borrowed million against a new million line of credit facility with a bank 
we paid a fee of per year  billed quarterly  for the unused portion of the line of credit 
during  we earned  of grant revenue under a grant from the city of danville  virginia  which was recorded as other income  compared to  of other income from this grant during 
table of contents reorganization costs we filed for reorganization on july  expenses incurred for professional fees and other costs associated with our reorganization were million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately  of such costs  as our plan of reorganization was approved in january income tax expense as of december   we had recorded a  deferred tax asset in connection with projected future net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we determined that the tax benefit was no longer likely to be realized  as a result of accrued costs related to the hansen litigation  and we therefore provided for a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset  resulting in a  non cash tax expense for the year 
preferred stock dividend in january  we issued  shares of our newly designated series a convertible preferred stock to carilion 
the series a convertible preferred stock carries an annual cumulative dividend of  or approximately per share 
during  we accrued approximately  for the dividends payable to carilion 
the dividends are not payable in cash  but rather in shares of our common stock  until a liquidation event occurs 
during   shares of common stock became issuable to carilion as dividends and have been recorded in the statement of stockholders equity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease of million  or  versus revenues of million for the year ended december  the decrease was comprised of a million  or  decrease in technology development revenue and a million  or  decrease in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we believe that the activities in this segment were adversely impacted by our chapter reorganization filed in july  which resulted in numerous expected awards for new development contracts being delayed until after our emergence from bankruptcy in product sales  product development  and licensing revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
product development activities included product development work for our arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc  and various arrangements with governmental entities 
product sales revenue decreased by to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   while revenues in this segment relating to product development activities remained flat at million for both years 
the general deterioration of the global economy  which began to impact our product sales during the fourth quarter of  continued to have an adverse effect on product sales throughout most of cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease primarily resulted from reduced overhead expenses attributable to this business segment as a result of our initiatives during to improve efficiency and reduce our costs of operations 

table of contents product and license cost of revenues decreased  or  from million to million  largely attributable to the decrease in product sales during compared to operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the increase in operating expense was driven by the million litigation settlement with hansen  as well as million in professional fees and other costs associated with that litigation incurred during  and the million non cash impairment charge associated with certain of our intangible assets 
professional fees and other litigation costs incurred during were approximately million 
share based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over share based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  we account for options granted at fair value on the date of grant and then recognize the compensation expense over the applicable vesting period of the option 
interest and other income expense our net interest expense for the year ended december  was  up from  for the year ended december  in may  we borrowed million from a bank under a term loan  which was repaid in full in july  and we also incurred interest on the convertible promissory notes issued to carilion in both years 
for the year ended december   we recognized other income  net  of million 
the primary components of this other income were  in net proceeds from a legal settlement and  earned under the grant from the city of danville related to our nanomaterials facility 
reorganization costs we filed for reorganization on july  and incurred million in professional fees and other costs associated with our reorganization during the year ended december  income tax expense as of december   we had recorded a  deferred tax asset in connection with projected future net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we determined that the tax benefit was no longer likely to be realized  as a result of accrued costs related to the hansen litigation  and we therefore provided for a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset  resulting in a  non cash tax expense for the year 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our total cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
during  we entered into a revolving line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  or svb  with a borrowing capacity of million 
as of december  and the date of this report  we have borrowed million under this facility and have million available 
the line of credit was scheduled to expire in accordance with its terms on february   but svb has agreed to extend the maturity until may   after which time we fully expect to either continue this line of credit or have a similar or enhanced agreement in place with svb 
borrowings under the line of credit with svb carry a floating annual interest rate equal to or  if greater  two percentage points above svb s prime rate then in effect 
amounts due under the facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  including our intellectual property  personal property and bank accounts 
amounts 
table of contents due under our january promissory note to hansen are subordinated to amounts due to svb under the line of credit  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the line of credit includes a fee of one half of one percent per annum based on the average unused portion of the facility from time to time 
the svb facility requires us to observe a number of financial and operational covenants  including maintenance of a specified liquidity ratio  achievement of certain adjusted ebitda targets  protection and registration of intellectual property rights  and certain customary negative covenants 
we may use the proceeds of borrowings for any variety of purposes  including working capital and general corporate purposes 
we are in compliance with the required covenants 
the line of credit with svb contains customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal  interest or other amounts  violation of covenants  material adverse change  an event of default under any subordinated debt documents  incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect  bankruptcy  judgments in excess of a threshold amount and violations of other agreements in excess of a threshold 
if any event of default occurs  svb may declare due immediately all borrowings and foreclose on the collateral 
furthermore  an event of default under the line of credit would result in an increase in the interest rate on any amounts outstanding 
we believe that our current cash balance  in addition to the funds available to us under the line of credit with svb  provide adequate liquidity for us to meet our working capital needs during the remainder of discussion of cash flows during the year ended december   operations used  of net cash  compared to the years ended december  and  in which we used approximately million and  in operations  respectively 
in  our net loss of million was offset by million of non cash expenses  while net changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
included in these working capital changes was our million settlement with hansen  which was accrued as an expense during but paid in during  our operating cash flow was the result of our million net loss  offset by the million accrued hansen settlement and million of other non cash expenses  including reorganization costs and intangible asset impairment charges  and a million net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during  our net loss of million was offset by million of non cash expenses  while net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash inflow of  cash used in investing activities relates to the purchase of property and equipment as well as capitalized costs associated with securing intellectual property rights 
during  we also made a small acquisition of intellectual property assets from a third party 
our overall cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  in and  in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million in during  we borrowed a term loan in the amount of million  which was repaid during during  we received  from the exercise of options and warrants and made  in payments on capital leases

we also lease a facility in mclean  virginia  which is fully subleased 
in august  our luna technologies subsidiary executed a non cancelable million purchase order for multiple shipments of tunable lasers to be delivered over an month period beginning in october as of december  approximately million of this commitment remained 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia 
one half of the grant was to be used to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and one half was to be used for our creation of new jobs 
we satisfied the job creation criteria in full and the capital expenditures criteria in part in and recognized  of the grant as income for that year 
in and we satisfied additional criteria and earned another approximately  of the grant 
in january  we agreed to repay the remaining  of the grant in quarterly installments through november other liabilities include remaining amounts payable for minimum royalty payments for certain licensed technologies payable over the remaining patent terms of the underlying technology 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k  item a ii

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes or have any derivative financial instruments 
our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate fluctuations due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations  and  as a result  interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is subject to changes in interest rates 
however  we believe that the impact of these fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position due to the immediate available liquidity or short term nature of these financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations as a result of our silicon valley bank debt facility having a variable interest rate 
however  the loan facility has a minimum fixed interest rate of  which was in effect 
table of contents during we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our debt 
for the principal amount of million outstanding under the line of credit as of december   a change in the interest rate by one percentage point for one year would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately  foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   all payments made under our research contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
our product sales to foreign customers are also denominated in us dollars  and we do not receive payments in foreign currency 
as such  we are not directly exposed to currency gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
