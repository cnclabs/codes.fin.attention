item a 
risk factors 
an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd s business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
current economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 
the global economic conditions may result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services  increased pricing pressure  longer sales cycles  and slower adoption of new technologies 
during fiscal year  our revenue growth was adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry  including lower healthcare utilization  particularly in the us and western europe  cost containment efforts by governments and other payors for healthcare services and other factors 
these conditions resulted in weaker overall customer demand and increased pricing pressure for some of our products 
we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  while the economic downturn has not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date  there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future 
the current macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers  and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future 
we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe  and we may experience similar delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity problems 
the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain  and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
over half of our fiscal year revenues were derived from international operations 
our revenues outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 
 management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 
changes in reimbursement practices of third party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 
our sales depend  in part  on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities  private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products 
the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers  which can vary among public and private sources  may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction 
legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of healthcare reform or otherwise  as discussed below or abroad could significantly 
table of contents reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products  or result in denial of reimbursement for those products 
see third party reimbursement under item business 
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted in march under the ppaca  beginning in  medical device manufacturers  such as bd  will pay a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices 
sales of bd products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about of bd s total us revenues in fiscal year we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business 
the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals  clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies  and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures 
these factors  in turn  could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure 
it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our products 
while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states  the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd s products remains uncertain 
efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of the law passed in august to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending  a bipartisan committee was established to identify up to trillion in cuts to federal programs 
on november   the joint committee announced that it would not reach an agreement by the prescribed deadline  which will trigger an automatic trillion in additional spending cuts in the absence of further legislative action 
half of the automatic reductions would come from lowering the caps imposed on domestic discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs  including reductions in payments to medicare providers 
government research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit reduction 
any such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure 
price volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our operations 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials  components  freight and energy 
in particular  bd purchases supplies of resins  which are oil based components used in the manufacture of certain products 
any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results 
increases in the price of oil can also increase bd s costs for packaging and transportation 
new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components 
these cost increases may adversely affect our profitability 
bd s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products  and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 
a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers 
the development of these products requires significant research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors  including bd s ability to innovate  develop and manufacture new products  complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad  or gain and maintain market approval of our products 
in addition  patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product 
there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval  or gain market acceptance 

table of contents we cannot guarantee that any of bd s strategic acquisitions  investments or alliances will be successful 
as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth  we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances 
such transactions are inherently risky 
the success of any acquisition  investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business 
there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 
the medical technology industry is very competitive 
the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes  and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold 
we face this competition from a wide range of companies 
these include large medical device companies  some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets 
other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well 
in some instances  competitors  including pharmaceutical companies  also offer  or are attempting to develop  alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device 
the development of new or improved products  processes or technologies by other companies such as needle free injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
in addition  increasing customer demand for more environmentally friendly products is creating another basis on which bd must compete 
the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other low cost manufacturing locations is also creating pricing pressure  particularly in developing markets 
some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 
new entrants may also appear  particularly from these low cost countries 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased 
in addition  group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers  which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers 
further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 
the international operations of bd s business may subject bd to certain business risks 
bd operations outside the united states subject bd to certain risks  including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above  the effects of local economic conditions  changes in foreign regulatory requirements  local product preferences  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  differing labor regulations  changes in tax laws  potential political instability  trade barriers  weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders 
the success of our operations outside the united states will depend  in part  on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to  among other things  our production facilities and distribution networks 
reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 
our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  government laboratories and private foundations 
research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions 
a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies  such as the us national institutes of health nih and agencies in other countries 
the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable 
there have been instances where nih 
table of contents grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods 
the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic downturn 
any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd s manufacturing operations and related product sales 
bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components 
certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources 
in addition  for quality assurance  cost effectiveness and other reasons  bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers 
the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons  including current economic conditions as described above 
while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis 
the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
we have manufacturing sites all over the world 
in addition  in some instances  the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants 
as a result  weather  natural disasters including pandemics  terrorism  political change  failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures  equipment malfunction  environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 
bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 
bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits  including purported class action lawsuits for  among other things  alleged antitrust violations and patent infringement  and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future 
a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party 
in view of these uncertainties  we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could adversely affect bd s results of operations and cash flows 
bd is subject to extensive regulation 
bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  by comparable agencies in foreign countries  and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies 
most of bd s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold 
the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions 
the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 
also  governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration  labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or re register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 
once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product  there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 
following the introduction of a product  these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance 
our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the 
table of contents production  marketing or sale of our products and result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  closure of manufacturing sites  seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation 
recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity  which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 
product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks 
manufacturing or design defects  unanticipated use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries  and could result  in certain cases  in the removal of a product from the market 
a recall could result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 
we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records  record transactions  provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements 
the design and implementation of the new erp system has required  and will continue to require  the investment of significant financial and human resources 
the total cost needed to implement the new erp system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully implement the new erp system without experiencing difficulties 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders  ship products  provide services and customer support  send invoices and track payments  fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 
our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 
many of bd s businesses rely on patent  trademark and other intellectual property assets 
while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially adversely affect bd operations  these intellectual property assets  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations  legal challenges or governmental action 
patents attained by competitors  particularly as patents on our products expire  may also adversely affect our competitive position 
the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings  financial condition or cash flows 
in addition  competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property 
resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and time consuming 
natural disasters  war and other events could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
natural disasters including pandemics  war  terrorism  labor disruptions and international conflicts  and actions taken by the united states and other governments  or by our customers or suppliers  in response to such events  could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate 
these events could result in decreased demand for our products  adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities  or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

table of contents we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees  including people in technical  marketing  sales and research positions 
competition for experienced employees  particularly for persons with specialized skills  can be intense 
bd s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors  including compensation and benefits  work location and work environment 
if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees  our business could be adversely affected

all of the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation mdl in federal court in new jersey 
on april   bd entered into a settlement agreement with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions 
the settlement agreement provided for  among other things  the payment by bd of million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint  and a dismissal of the case with prejudice  insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims 
the release would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement 
on september   the court issued an order denying a motion to approve the settlement agreement  ruling that the hospital plaintiffs  and not the distributor plaintiffs  are the direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain sales of bd products 
the settlement agreement currently remains in effect  subject to certain termination provisions  and the federal court of appeals has granted the distributor plaintiffs request to appeal the trial court s order on an interlocutory basis 
bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class action matters beyond the million already accrued and changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the future as additional information becomes available

rti alleges that the bd integra tm syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to rti 
rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief 
on august   the court ordered the consolidation of the patent cases 
on november   at a trial of these consolidated cases  the jury rendered a verdict in favor of rti on all but one of its infringement claims  but did not find any willful infringement  and awarded rti million in damages 
on may   the court granted rti s motion for a permanent injunction against the continued sale by bd of its bd integra tm products in their current form  but stayed the injunction for the duration of bd s appeal 
at the same time  the court lifted a stay of rti s non patent claims 
on july   the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the district court judgment that bd s ml integra tm products infringed the asserted rti patents and affirmed the district court judgment of infringement against bd s discontinued ml integra tm products 
on october   the federal circuit court of appeals denied rti s request for an en banc rehearing 
the trial on rti s antitrust and false advertising claims is scheduled to begin in february with respect to rti s antitrust and false advertising claims  bd cannot estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss as there are significant legal and factual issues to be resolved 
in the event that rti succeeds at trial and subsequent appeals  however  any potential loss could be material as rti will likely seek to recover substantial damages including disgorgement of profits and damages under the federal antitrust laws which are trebled 
bd believes rti s allegations are without merit 
on october   gen probe incorporated gen probe filed a patent infringement action against bd in the us district court for the southern district of california 
the complaint alleges that the bd viper tm and bd viper tm xtr tm systems and bd probetec tm specimen collection products infringe certain us patents of gen probe 
on march   gen probe filed a complaint  also in the us district court for the southern district of california  alleging that the bd max tm instrument infringes gen probe patents 
the patents alleged to be infringed are a subset of the gen probe patents asserted against bd in the october suit 
on june   the court consolidated these cases 
gen probe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for this matter as the proceedings are in relatively early stages and there are significant issues to be resolved 
bd believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above mentioned suits pending against bd and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters 
bd is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
bd is a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states brought under the comprehensive environment response  compensation and liability act  also known as superfund  and similar state laws 
the affected sites are in varying stages of development 
in some instances  the remedy has been completed  while in others  environmental studies are commencing 
for all sites  there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all cleanup costs 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters  without considering possible third party recoveries 
in view of the uncertainties discussed below  bd could incur charges in excess of any currently 
table of contents established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial review company overview description of the company and business segments becton  dickinson and company bd is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development  manufacture and sale of medical devices  instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions  life science researchers  clinical laboratories  the pharmaceutical industry and the general public 
our business consists of three worldwide business segments bd medical medical  bd diagnostics diagnostics and bd biosciences biosciences 
our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end users by bd and independent sales representatives 
references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years  which end on september strategic objectives bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value  while making appropriate investments for the future 
bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies to increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers  to increase investment in research and development for platform extensions and innovative new products  to make significant investments in growing our emerging markets  to improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity  to drive an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns 
our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences enabling safer  simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery  improving clinical outcomes through new  accurate and faster diagnostics  providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitates the understanding of the cell  cellular diagnostics and cell therapy  enhancing disease management in diabetes  women s health and cancer  and infection control 
we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles to maintain a solid investment grade rating  to ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities  to optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions 
in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd s financial condition and operating performance  management generally reviews quarterly forecast data  monthly actual results  segment sales and other similar information 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial data  including gross profit margin  selling and administrative expense  investment in research and development  return on invested capital  and cash flows 

table of contents financial results worldwide revenues in of billion increased from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately  estimated favorable foreign exchange translation of  and estimated price decreases of just under  reflecting an ongoing downward trend 
worldwide revenue growth was also negatively impacted by about percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to  which included strong sales related to the hn flu pandemic  supplemental government spending in japan and economic stimulus research spending in the us we experienced strong international sales of safety engineered products and strong growth in emerging markets  which was offset  in part  by weaker demand in western europe resulting from austerity measures and lower healthcare utilization 
sales in the united states of safety engineered devices grew to billion in from billion in international sales of safety engineered devices grew to million in from million in  which included an estimated of favorable foreign currency translation 
international safety engineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong growth in the medical segment  with the largest growth in emerging markets  including china and latin america 
the healthcare industry is facing a challenging economic environment 
the current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products  and we expect this downward pricing trend to continue through fiscal year in addition  healthcare utilization in the us and western europe remains constrained due to decreases in government and private healthcare spending  resulting in less demand for our products  and we also expect these conditions to continue into fiscal we are also experiencing increased raw material costs 
our anticipated revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come from business growth and expansion among all segments and regions of the world  and the development in each business segment of new products and services that provide increased benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers 
our ability to sustain our long term growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion  develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business segments  and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness 
in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere  numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including  without limitation  increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives 
for example  the us healthcare reform law contains certain tax provisions that will affect bd 
the most significant impact is the medical device excise tax  which imposes a tax on certain us sales of medical devices  beginning in january sales of bd products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about of bd s total us revenues in fiscal year our financial position remains strong  with cash flows from operating activities totaling billion in at september   we had billion in cash and equivalents and short term investments 
in  cash outflows relating to acquisitions included the purchase of carmel pharma ab carmel pharma  a swedish company that manufactures the bd phaseal system  a closed system drug transfer device for the safe handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials  for million  net of cash acquired 
cash outflows in also reflected the acquisition of accuri cytometers  inc accuri a company that develops and manufactures personal flow cytometers for researchers  for million  net of cash acquired 
capital expenditures were million in as we continue to invest in capacity across our segments to support future growth 
bd s strong cash flow generation also provided the flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends
