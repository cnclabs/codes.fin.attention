table of contents part i item business 
overview electromed  inc we  us  electromed or the company was founded by mr 
robert d 
hansen and mr 
craig n 
hansen and incorporated in minnesota in in august  we completed an initial public offering ipo of  shares of our common stock 
in september  the underwriter in the ipo acquired an additional  shares pursuant to the exercise of a portion of its over allotment option 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under the ticker symbol elmd 
we manufacture  market and sell products that provide airway clearance therapy  including the electromed smartvest airway clearance system electromed smartvest system and related products  to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
the electromed smartvest system generates high frequency chest wall oscillation hfcwo  also known as high frequency chest compression  a technique for airway clearance therapy 
hfcwo facilitates airway clearance by loosening and mobilizing respiratory secretions in a patient s lungs 
a vest is worn over the torso that repeatedly compresses and releases the chest at frequencies from to cycles per second 
each compression or oscillation produces pulsations within the lungs that shear secretions from the surfaces of the airways and propels them toward the mouth where they can be removed by normal coughing 
unlike traditional chest physio therapy  which must be performed on the patient while he or she is placed in a series of often uncomfortable positions  hfcwo can be performed with the patient sitting upright 
studies show that hfcwo therapy is as effective an airway clearance method for patients who have cystic fibrosis or other forms of compromised pulmonary function as traditional chest physio therapy administered by a respiratory therapist 
however  hfcwo can be self administered  relieving a caregiver of participation in the therapy  and eliminating the attendant cost of an in home care provider 
we believe the treatments are cost effective primarily because they reduce a patient s risk of respiratory infections and other secondary complications that are associated with impaired mucus transport 
secondary complications  such as pneumonia  may be serious or life threatening and often result in costly hospital visits 
the electromed smartvest system is a portable  programmable  and multi positional airway clearance machine that generates hfcwo and has been approved by the food and drug administration fda to treat the condition of excess lung secretions 
consequently  it may be prescribed to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  muscular dystrophy  post surgical airway complications and a variety of other diseases and conditions associated with impaired lung and airway capacity 
by clearing airways  patients are able to rid their lungs of retained secretions and are therefore less likely to develop lung infections such as pneumonia 
the electromed smartvest system features a programmable electro mechanical pulse generator and a pneumatic therapy garment  which together provide safe  comfortable  and effective airway clearance therapy 
we believe that the lightweight  portable design allows patients greater freedom to travel and enjoy activities of daily living  resulting in enhanced quality of life for patients using the electromed smartvest system 
a broad range of vest sizes for children and adults allow for tailored fit and function 
user friendly controls allow children to administer their own daily therapy under adult supervision 
our goal has been to make the hfcwo airway clearance treatments as comfortable and convenient as possible so our patients can more easily tolerate their regimen and be able to perform their treatments as readily as possible 
in order to maintain and expand our position in the market for airway clearance therapy products  we have assembled an experienced team of employees with expertise in health care  product development  manufacturing  marketing  sales  and financial management 
for example  approximately of our employees are respiratory therapists 
in addition  we engage over respiratory therapists and health professionals on a non exclusive independent contractor basis to educate and train customers on the electromed smartvest system 
our team also includes several consultants who advise us on quality assurance  product development  and financing  and who keep us apprised of industry developments and opportunities in europe 

table of contents personnel our management team has significant business experience and has developed industry relationships  resulting from memberships in various respiratory care professional groups and attendance  sponsorship and participation in numerous medical conferences in the us  europe  and asia 
in june  we appointed dr 
james j 
cassidy to the newly created position of chief operating officer 
dr 
cassidy has extensive international management experience in the medical device industry 
in addition to relationships developed at the management level  our staff and contractors  who often play a key role in the education of current and potential customers  have developed trusted relationships across the us with physicians and other caregivers over the course of their careers 
approximately of our full time employees  including our entire patient services department and approximately half of our sales representatives  are respiratory therapists 
many of these individuals have extensive experience in the field of respiratory care  and their relationships and experience are of great worth to us 
these individuals maintain a dialogue with clinics  patients  patient families  and respiratory therapist trainers to ensure that our products are being properly operated and are performing effectively 
additionally  our sales representatives participate in various events  such as family days held by the cystic fibrosis foundation for cystic fibrosis patients  at which they have an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electromed smartvest system and further develop relationships with patients  patient families  physicians and hospitals 
in order to ensure the efficient production of high quality products  we employ experienced personnel in our engineering and manufacturing departments and work with an established network of vendors who permit us to integrate all assembly and quality assurance on a single campus 
our products our products are primarily used in the home health care market 
we also sell our products for use in hospitals  which we refer to as institutional sales 
accordingly  our points of contact are home health care use  hospitals  clinics  and pulmonary rehabilitation centers  both domestically and internationally 
the electromed smartvest system is a doctor prescribed therapy and  depending on the circumstances of the patient  its cost to an individual is generally reimbursable by medicare  medicaid  private insurance  or a combination of the three 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our products 
the electromed smartvest system the electromed smartvest system consists of a pneumatic therapy garment  an electronic pulse generator for creating and controlling force pulses  and a single hose which extends the force pulses from the generator to the pneumatic vest 
the electromed smartvest system is a portable airway clearance therapy system that gives the patient direct control over the most difficult and time consuming aspects of respiratory therapy  and provides caregivers an easier and more reproducible means of administering therapy to disabled or bedridden patients 
the electromed smartvest system also has other appealing practical features  including improved ease of use and a non clinical appearance 
we believe these attributes particularly appeal to children  teenagers and young adults who represent the majority of the cystic fibrosis patient population 
our system allows the patient to be relatively mobile while therapy is being given  unlike manual chest physical therapy in which the patient must remain in a fixed position 
the electromed smartvest system therapy garment offers the following features design we have pioneered a vest design that provides consistent and controlled pulse pressure that is distributed throughout the vest and treats the entire front and back thoracic chest cavity 
the electromed vest is low profile  featuring a soft  breathable fabric 
some competitive models have reduced weight and size of their vests by reducing coverage area of the chest and applying pressure to the chest only 
we do not endorse or employ a partial coverage vest  and all of our products offer degree coverage 
our vest uses a flow through system design  which improves patient comfort by providing a continuous accommodation grid of air release holes in the vest air bladder  allowing air releases to automatically adjust 
this can prevent lags in pulse pressure accommodation as compared to a closed loop system  in which electronic signal generators must continuously send changes in air fill instruction to the air pump 
we believe heightened patient comfort is realized because of our flow through design 

table of contents size and ease of use the electromed smartvest system is available in eight sizes to accommodate children and adults 
the simple design of the velcro and overlap closure system creates a broad size adjustment range to insure a properly tailored fit 
it also makes the electromed vest easier to clean and disinfect than some competitors products  which often use straps and buckles 
the patented design includes a removable bladder  permitting the therapy garment to be easily washed and dried 
this feature also helps improve infection control efforts 
material an attractive washable nylon shell with quick fit velcro provides an appealing non clinical look and feel  which we believe enhances self esteem and patient compliance 
modular assembly the electromed vest s modular assembly allows the custom modification of the manifold to enhance pulsation and avoid local areas of sensitivity such as incisions and catheters 
the electromed smartvest system s electronic pulse generator features the following important aspects portable design the pulse generator for the electromed smartvest system is streamlined and fits into a roller bag for easy transport 
our product s vest and hose are carried in a small companion bag 
the unit is relatively lightweight and can be readily carried or rolled by an individual 
the system complies with airline carry on size limits and can be carried onto an airplane or stowed in the trunk of a car  allowing patients greater freedom to travel 
single hose system when the electromed smartvest system is in use  a single hose delivers the pulsation to the vest  which we believe provides therapy in a more comfortable and unobtrusive manner than a two hose system 
in addition to facilitating patient comfort  the single hose system provides effective treatment by simplifying delivery of the air pulse energy to the lungs 
the pulse is delivered evenly from the base of the smartvest therapy garment  extending the force pulses upward and inward in strong but smooth cycles of degree latitudes  which delivers simultaneous treatment to the patient s chest and back and all lobes of the lungs 
programmable pulse generation the electromed smartvest system uses a pulse generator with an internal programmable memory feature to generate a pneumatic pulse electronically 
the pulse frequency can be adjusted from to cycles per second  which accommodates the required therapeutic range 
the range can be preset with programmable controls  in order to assure patient safety and specific treatment requirements 
for example  the unit can be programmed to deliver a varying pulse frequency during the course of a treatment session without requiring manually directed changes 
we believe this feature adds convenience and enhances patient compliance with treatment protocol choices 
power supply the electromed smartvest system also includes a power supply suitable for use in international markets  such that voltage and amperage are accommodated automatically 

table of contents other products we market the electromed single patient use vest spuv and electromed smartvest wrap to health care providers  particularly those working in intensive care units 
hospitals issue the spuv or electromed smartvest wrap to one patient for the duration of his or her stay 
both products facilitate continuity of care because they introduce the patient to our product line and may encourage use of the electromed smartvest system for home care  which can be provided to the chronic condition patient upon discharge 
both products provide full coverage pulsation 
the spuv is a full sized vest that is often used for patients undergoing institutional treatment who are already accustomed to using an electromed smartvest system 
the spuv is intended for short term  in patient use and allows the patient to avoid contaminating his or her home use vest while continuing treatment in a hospital or other facility 
the electromed smartvest wrap  which we introduced in  is lightweight  convenient  and well suited for patients recovering from surgery and short term illnesses 
we believe that the design of the electromed smartvest wrap  which lacks a vest outer shell  makes it easy for the health care professional to operate because it does not need to go over the patient s head  minimizing the need to move post surgical patients and avoiding interference with other apparatuses the patient may be using 
in addition  the wrap is reversible  which allows the air pulse generator to be aligned on either side of a hospital bed 
we believe that our ability to provide a relatively more comfortable therapy alternative to patients results in a higher likelihood of patient cooperation and consistent use 
we have designed and patented a mobile pedestal  which we manufacture and provide with sales of our institutional models of the electromed smartvest system 
the mobile pedestal allows for easy transport within the medical facility 
this unit includes a pneumatic feature  permitting ease of movement in raising and lowering the vertical position of the generator 
our markets we market our hfcwo products to a broad patient population 
for patients with a chronic pulmonary condition  many hours per day may be dedicated to a variety of treatments 
the electromed smartvest system provides effective airway clearance therapy in a comfortable and portable design which allows patients greater independence and speed of treatment 
building from a foundation of product quality  as well as our dedication to customer service  our goal is to be a consistent innovator in providing airway clearance therapy to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
because sale of the electromed smartvest system is by physician s prescription only  we market to health care professionals  such as doctors  nurses  respiratory therapists  and clinic coordinators 
however  with respect to both our in home and institutional products  the health care professionals decisions may be based on preferences expressed by patients 
therefore  we believe that it is also important to market our products to patients and caregivers 
in addition  because the availability of reimbursement is an important consideration for health care professionals and patients  we must also prove the effectiveness of our product to public and private insurance providers 
the electromed smartvest system is currently prescribed to patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis cf  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  bronchiectasis  neuro muscular disorders or post surgical complications and patients who are ventilator dependent or have other conditions involving excess secretion and impaired mucus transport 
when we entered the market in  we focused on providing our product to cf patients because we felt those individuals could greatly benefit from treatment from our hfcwo system and it was the indication most likely to qualify for reimbursement at that time 
over time  we have expanded our focus to include post surgical and intensive care patients at risk of developing pneumonia  patients with end stage neuromuscular disease  and ventilator dependent patients 

table of contents the essential requirements that make a patient a candidate for airway clearance therapy are compromised respiratory function with a need to secure airway clearance therapy on a cost effective long term basis  confidently and with relative ease  maintain and or improve pulmonary status  mobilize secretions several times per day  and carry out activities of daily living 
the electromed smartvest system is designed to meet the individual patient s needs by providing a therapy that is efficient  is easy to administer  and can be performed independently 
electromed s established marketing and product support services provide education  training  and follow up with the patient population to insure the product is integrated into their daily treatment regimen 
we believe advantages of the electromed smartvest system to the independent patient include usually can be reimbursed by private insurance  by federal or state government programs or combinations of the foregoing  consistent treatments at home  independence from a dedicated caregiver  portability  improved comfort during therapy  and improved self image 
marketing  sales and distribution during our fiscal year  we worked to expand and reposition our domestic sales force 
we believe these efforts contributed to our revenue growth in fiscal we expect to achieve future earnings and sales growth through focusing on continuing educational opportunities and industry relationships  building distributor relationships in europe and asia  and maintaining leadership in product innovation 
we participate in medical conferences and maintain industry contacts in order to increase the visibility of our products and acceptance by physicians and health care professionals  as well as patients 
in addition  we have a designated marketing department and place advertisements in leading medical magazines and journals in the us and europe 
we also believe that the internet has provided us with a marketing benefit in recent years  as several overseas distributors have contacted us after visiting our website 

table of contents north american marketing approximately half of our domestic sales representatives are respiratory therapists 
each sales representative  or clinical area manager cam  is responsible for introducing our products  principally the electromed smartvest system  to clinics and hospitals within a specific geographical area  and are also able to provide training and continued support to customers 
as of june   we had total sales representatives  including a national sales manager  regional sales managers  and cam s 
collectively  our sales force covers the entire united states and portions of canada  which we have divided into west  midwest  and east regions 
each clinical area manager is assigned to a particular territory within one of the three regions 
we have also developed a network of over respiratory therapists and health care professionals to assist with training patients across the us on a non exclusive independent contractor basis 
we believe that the professional knowledge of the cam s and trainers demonstrates our commitment to customer service and facilitates sales 
international marketing in fiscal  our international sales comprised approximately of net revenue 
internationally  we have made sales in fifteen different countries 
in addition to sales made in canada  the principal countries in which we have made sales internationally  and the countries in which our principal distributors are located  are italy  japan and taiwan 
we are actively identifying distributors and other international sales opportunities 
our historical practice and continued intent includes developing long term relationships with distributors who have knowledge and experience in serving respiratory physicians and patients in the host country 
units are sold at a consistent price with payment made directly from the distributor  rather than allowing payments consistent with reimbursement procedures as is the case for domestic sales 
for all international sales  our quality assurance department and chief financial officer monitor pricing  payments and conforming regulatory practice 
our chief executive officer and marketing director oversee the growth and performance of international sales 
competition hfcwo was first developed for cf patients at the university of minnesota 
the purpose of hfcwo is to provide more effective mucus clearance in a form that could be performed independently of a caregiver 
the original technology was licensed to american biosystems  inc now advanced respiratory  inc 
ari  part of hill rom holdings  inc  a publicly traded company which  until the introduction of our original medpulse respiratory vest system in  was the only manufacturer of this technology 
all of ari s products use a two hose  closed loop system  in contrast to the single hose  flow through system that we designed  which we believe provides greater ease of use and patient comfort 
in  respiratory technologies  inc  a privately held company doing business as respirtech  received fda clearance to market their incourage system the incourage system  which includes a hfwco vest 
like the electromed smartvest system  ari s the vest and respirtech s incourage system are cleared for market by the fda 
from a clinical performance perspective  all hfcwo products meet a common standard of substantial equivalence 
as a result  features and benefits such as number of hoses required to deliver the therapy one hose versus two hoses  construction quality  appearance of the generator  reputation for patient services  and sales effectiveness of field personnel have become key variables 
we believe that the product features of the electromed smartvest system enable us to compete effectively  particularly when health care professionals  patients  and caregivers are provided with demonstrations of product choices prior to committing to a specific product 
we often provide demonstration units to encourage such comparisons 
unlike our competitors products  the electromed smartvest system has a single hose  flow through system design and an adjustable vest made from soft  breathable and washable fabric 
we use velcro in our patented vest to provide a tailored fit  as opposed to an inflatable fit model 
in addition to product features  our focus on providing exemplary customer training and service  along with our commitment to engage and retain highly motivated employees and contractors  many of whom are medical professionals  provides a valuable competitive advantage 

table of contents alternative products for administering pulmonary therapy include positive expiratory pressure pep mask  which provides backpressure into the lungs on expiration to keep respiratory tracts open longer to drain  the flutter scandipharm  a tube which vibrates on expiration  acapella vibratory pep therapy system smiths medical  a handheld device that combines pep with oscillations  intrapulmonary percussive ventilation device  generally comprised of a ventilator that combines positive air pressure with nebulisation as appropriate  and traditional chest physical therapy cpt  which is usually performed one to four times per day 
physicians may prescribe some or all of these devices and techniques  depending upon each patient s health status  severity of disease  compliance  or personal preference 
we believe our primary competitive advantage over alternative treatments is patient comfort  ease of use  and the effectiveness of hfcwo treatment as compared to cpt and other alternative treatments 
because hfcwo is not technique dependent  as compared to most other pulmonary therapy products  therapy begins automatically once power is provided and remains consistent and controlled for the duration of the session 
we strive to make the electromed smartvest system an increasingly attractive and comfortable form of hfcwo therapy 
we believe that hfcwo therapy generally  and the electromed smartvest system in particular  produces less interference with daily activities  which increases the likelihood of regular use 
we believe these advantages encourage physicians to prescribe and patients to request the electromed smartvest system for pulmonary therapy 
reimbursement for the diverse patient populations for each of these pulmonary therapies varies greatly because a patient s medical care costs are typically addressed by a combination of private insurance and government benefit schedules  as well as state health care policies and programs 
research and development in addition to the us patents and foreign patents that we currently hold  we have a number of pending patent applications domestically and internationally 
as of june   our research and development staff consisted of three full time employee engineers 
we also receive engineering support from several consultants  including mr 
craig n 
hansen  pursuant to an agreement with hansen engine corporation 
see part iii  item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
our team  the majority of whom have experience in respiratory therapy and medical device development  has a demonstrated record of developing new products which receive the appropriate product approvals and regulatory clearances  with our products having been approved or cleared in the us  canada  and the member countries of the european economic area 
during the fiscal years ended june  and we incurred research and development expenses of  and  respectively 
as a result of our expected investments in enhancing the electromed smartvest system  we intend to spend at least of net revenue on research and development activities for the foreseeable future 

table of contents intellectual property as of june   we held issued us patents and foreign patents covering the electromed smartvest system and its underlying technology  and had pending us and foreign patent applications 
these patents and patent applications offer coverage in the field of air pressure pulse delivery to a human in support of airway clearance 
our first us patent expires in and in canada in we generally pursue patent protection for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices in foreign countries in which we make regular sales 
we have been granted patent protection in canada  new zealand and south africa 
we have additional patent applications pending in canada  japan  and south korea and with the european patent organization  whose member states include spain  croatia  greece  italy  portugal  and romania 
we have also received the following us trademark and service mark registrations medpulse  medpulse respiratory vest system  smartvest  smartvest wrap  smartwrap  fact  soft start  trimline  and creating superior care through innovation 
manufacturing our headquarters in new prague  minnesota include a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility of more than  square feet 
our site has been regularly audited by the fda  in accordance with fda practices  and we maintain our operations in a manner consistent with fda requirements for a medical device manufacturer 
our manufacturing processes emphasize simplicity  cost effectiveness  and a capacity to realize increases in production volume with escalation in demand 
all employees are responsible for maintaining specific manufacturing and quality standards  which are monitored by our quality assurance manager under an extensive system designed to satisfy fda and international organization for standardization iso standards 
our staff is responsible for manufacturing each electromed smartvest system 
while components are outsourced based upon detailed specifications  each electromed smartvest system is assembled  tested  and approved for final shipment at our manufacturing site in new prague  minnesota  under careful control consistent with fda  underwriters laboratory ul  and iso standards 
while all third party vendors present some degree of risk of supply or impairment issues  many of our vendors are located within miles of our headquarters  which enables us to closely monitor the supply chain 
we maintain at least a two month supply of all of our critical components  and the materials used in the electromed smartvest system are generally available from a number of suppliers 
a rigorous quality standard is applied to components received from vendors 
any adverse findings result in the quarantine of any out of specification components 
before an electromed smartvest system is shipped to a patient  rigorous testing is again applied to match the performance of the air pulse generator with the particular vest size stipulated for the patient 
seasonality our business is not materially affected by seasonality 
product warranties we provide a warranty on the electromed smartvest system that covers the cost of replacement parts and labor  or a new electromed smartvest system in the event we determine a full replacement is necessary 
for electromed smartvest systems initially purchased and currently located in the united states and canada  we provide a lifetime warranty to the individual patient for whom the system is prescribed 
for products sold to patients in greece  we provide a five year warranty 
for sales to institutions within the united states and canada  and for all other sales to individuals and institutions made outside of the united states  canada and greece  we provide a three year warranty 
our warranties provide that if a newer model of our systems has been developed and sold between the time of purchase of the original system and we determine the need for replacement  we may replace the system with a newer model at our discretion 

table of contents third party reimbursement in the us  individuals who use the electromed smartvest system will generally rely on third party payers  including private payers and governmental payers such as medicare and medicaid  to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of using the electromed smartvest system 
reimbursement for hfcwo therapy and the electromed smartvest system varies among public and private insurance providers 
most patients are able to qualify for reimbursement and payment from medicare  medicaid  private insurance or combinations of the foregoing 
we expect that subsequent generations of hfcwo products will also qualify for reimbursement under medicare plan b and most major health plans 
however  some third party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies 
in addition  we face the risk that new or modified products could have a lower reimbursement rate  or that the levels of reimbursement currently available for our existing products could decrease  which would hamper our ability to market and sell that product 
consequently  our sales will continue to depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  even though our devices may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the fda 
the manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payer involved and the setting in which the procedure is furnished 
the nature of any future legislation is uncertain  making it difficult for us to predict the impact of cost containment trends on operating results 
a key element in our customer support strategy has been achieved by establishing an effective reimbursement department to seek insurance authorization and process claims on behalf of the patient 
the skill and knowledge gained and offered by our reimbursement department is an important factor in building our revenue and serving patients financial interests 
our payment terms allow patients to acquire the electromed smartvest system over a period of to months  which is consistent with reimbursement procedures followed by medicare and other third parties 
the amount we receive for any single unit is based on reimbursement schedules and may vary based on a number of factors  including medicare and third party reimbursement processes and policies 
the patient maintains the risk of reimbursement to the company in the event of non payment by third party payers 
payments for overseas sales are made directly by the distributors  and we are not involved in the reimbursement process 
overseas sales were approximately of our net revenue in fiscal governmental regulation medicare and medicaid recent government and private sector initiatives in the us and foreign countries are aimed to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments  and managed care arrangements  and are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical devices 
government programs  including medicare and medicaid  have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments  restricting coverage for certain products or services  and implementing other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs 
in addition  many private insurance programs look to medicare as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts 
this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers 

table of contents product regulations our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies  including the fda and comparable foreign agencies 
to varying degrees  each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  marketing  and distribution of our medical devices 
since inception  management has retained the necessary clinical  medical and legal expertise to support required clearances and approvals to market our products 
a full time quality assurance manager as well as a consulting regulatory and clinical expert provide detailed oversight of their respective areas of responsibility 
the company s chief operating officer provides oversight with respect to the manufacturing  quality assurance  research and development  and product development activities of the company 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our products  including the electromed smartvest system  as a powered percussor 
on april   our model ez smartvest was cleared to market by the fda pursuant to a k submission 
we obtained iso certification in january  which demonstrates to our international distributors and customers that our products conform to uniform standards for manufacturing quality and that our business meets certain professional standards 
in addition  we obtained clearance to use the european union ce mark on our products in april the ce mark is required for medical device sales in countries within the european economic area  which includes the twenty seven member countries of the european union as well as iceland  liechtenstein  norway  switzerland  turkey  and other european countries that may adopt eu standards voluntarily 
renewal of the ce mark is required every five years  and our notified body performs an annual audit to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
we have maintained our ce mark in good standing since originally receiving it and most recently renewed it in january we also require all of our distributors to comply with their home country regulations 
fda approval requirements if we develop new medical devices or modifications to existing products that would affect the product s safety or effectiveness  we may be required to obtain fda clearance before marketing the new or modified product in the us  either through the k clearance process or the more complex premarket approval application process 
the application process may be time consuming and expensive  particularly if clinical trials are required 
failure to obtain such clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
delays in receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
continuing product regulation in addition to its approval processes for new products  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of previously approved products that have been commercialized  and may prevent or limit further marketing of products based on the results of these post marketing programs 
at any time after approval of a product  the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the fda s quality system regulation qsr requirements and or current medical device reporting regulations 
product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  seizures or recalls of products with the attendant expenses  the banning of a particular device  an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution  as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims 

table of contents we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and  as a result  we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda s qsr requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
we are also required to maintain certain certifications in order to sell products internationally  and we undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
advertising and promotion of medical devices  in addition to being regulated by the fda  are also regulated by the federal trade commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities 
recently  promotional activities for fda regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes 
competitors and others can also initiate litigation relating to advertising claims 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine or criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
fraud and abuse laws federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or other federally funded health care programs 
the principal federal laws include the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program  the anti kickback statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program  and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims with any third party payer 
there are often similar state false claims  anti kickback  and anti self referral and insurance laws that apply to state funded medicaid and other health care programs and private third party payers 
in addition  the us foreign corrupt practices act can be used to prosecute companies in the us for arrangements with physicians  or other parties outside the us if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country 
enforcement of all of these regulations has become increasingly stringent  particularly due to more prevalent use of the whistleblower provisions under the false claims act  which allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery 
if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial penalties  fines and damages  and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 
hipaa and other fraud and privacy regulations federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information  including patient records  and restrict the use and disclosure of such information 
in particular  the us department of health and human services has issued patient privacy and security standards for electronic health information under the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations hipaa 

table of contents the hipaa privacy and security standards govern the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities  which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses 
because we provide our products directly to patients and bill third party payers such as medicare  medicaid  and insurance companies  we are a covered entity and must comply with these standards 
the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the health care industry  however  our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us 
failure to comply with hipaa or any state or foreign laws regarding personal data protection may result in significant fines or penalties and or negative publicity 
in addition to federal regulations issued under hipaa  some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that  in some cases  are more stringent than those issued under hipaa 
in those cases  it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws 
if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations  we could be subject to additional sanctions 
the hipaa health care fraud and false statement statutes also prohibit  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers  and knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
environmental laws we are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other medical device companies  our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws  primarily manufacturing and sterilization processes 
to the best of our knowledge at this time  we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows

the forward looking statements include statements that reflect management s beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  anticipations and intentions with respect to our future development plans  capital resources and requirements  results of operations  and future business performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled information regarding forward looking statements immediately preceding part i of this report 
overview electromed  inc we  us  electromed or the company was incorporated in we are engaged in the business of providing innovative airway clearance products applying high frequency chest wall oscillation hfcwo technologies in pulmonary care for patients of all ages 
we manufacture  market and sell products that provide hfcwo  including the smartvest airway clearance system electromed smartvest system and related products  to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
our products are sold for both the home health care market and the institutional market for use by patients in hospitals  which we refer to as institutional sales 
for approximately eleven years  we have marketed the electromed smartvest system and its predecessor products to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  bronchiectasis and repeated episodes of pneumonia 
additionally  we offer our products to a patient population that includes post surgical and intensive care patients at risk of developing pneumonia  patients with end stage neuromuscular disease  and ventilator dependent patients 
because sale of the electromed smartvest system is by a physician s prescription only  we market to physicians and health care providers as well as directly to patients 
in addition to distributors overseas  we have established our own domestic sales force  which we believe is able to provide superior support and training to our customers 
in addition  we have non exclusive independent contractor arrangements with over respiratory therapists and health care professionals who also provide education and training to our customers 
further  although the reimbursement process is subject to many contingencies  the electromed smartvest system is often eligible for reimbursement from major private insurance providers  hmos  state medicaid systems  and the federal medicare system  which is an important consideration for patients considering an hfcwo course of therapy 
for domestic sales  the electromed smartvest system may be reimbursed under the medicare assigned billing code for high frequency chest wall oscillation devices if the patient has cystic fibrosis  bronchiectasis including chronic bronchitis or copd that has resulted in a diagnosis of bronchiectasis  or any one of certain enumerated neuro muscular diseases  and can demonstrate that another less expensive physical or mechanical treatment did not adequately mobilize retained secretions 
private payers consider a variety of sources  including medicare  as guidelines in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts 
we have been generating revenue from the sale of the electromed smartvest system or its predecessor products since and have generated net income since the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   we generated revenue of approximately  and net income of approximately  our sales growth rate was for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year and was for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
net income as a percentage of sales was in compared to in management believes the increase in net income in dollars was primarily the result of the increased sales resulting from expansion of our sales force 
the decrease in net income as a percentage of sales was the result of higher expenses from expansion of the sales force and higher direct sales and sales support expenses  along with increased expenses relating to being a public company 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect reported amounts 
those estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and our reported revenues and expenses 
we update these estimates  assumptions and judgments as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we use our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate  they are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our primary critical accounting policies and estimates 
please also refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues from direct patient sales are recorded at the amount to be received from patients under their arrangements with third party payers  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
in addition  we record an estimate for selling price adjustments which often arise from changes in a patient s insurance coverage  changes in a patient s state of domicile  insurance company coverage limitations or patient death 
we periodically review originally billed amounts and our collection history and make changes to the estimation process by considering any changes in recent collection or sales allowance experience  but have not made material adjustments to previously recorded revenues and receivables 
other than the installment sales as discussed below  we expect to receive payment on the vast majority of accounts receivable within one year and therefore classify all receivables as current assets 
however  in some instances  payment for direct patient sales can be delayed or interrupted resulting in a small portion of collections occurring later than one year 
in the event receivables are expected to be paid over longer intervals than one year  we recognize revenue under the installment method 
certain third party reimbursement agencies pay us on a monthly installment basis  which can span from to months in the cases of wisconsin  new york and texas medicaid  which constitute the majority of our installment method sales 
due to the length of time over which reimbursement is received  we believe that the inherent uncertainty of collection due to external factors noted above precludes us from making a reasonable estimate of revenue at the time the product is shipped 
in certain circumstances  the patient must periodically attest that the unit continues to be utilized as a prerequisite to continued reimbursement coverage 
therefore  we believe the installment method is appropriate for these sales 
if the third party reimbursement agency discontinues payment and we determine no further payments will be made from the patient  the carrying value of the account receivable is written off as a period adjustment against the previously recognized sales 
under the installment method  we do not record accounts receivable or revenue at the time of product shipment 
we defer the revenue associated with the sale and  as each installment is received  that amount is recognized as revenue 
deferred costs associated with the sale are amortized to cost of revenue ratably over the estimated period in which collections are scheduled to occur 
accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which are accounts from which payment is not expected to be received although product was provided and revenue was earned 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 

table of contents we request that customers return to us previously sold units that are no longer in use  in order to limit the possibility that such units would be resold by unauthorized parties or used by individuals without a prescription 
the customer is under no obligation to return the product  however  we do reclaim the majority of previously sold units upon the discontinuance of patient usage 
we have not obtained certification to recondition and resell returned units 
returned units are primarily used for warranty replacement parts and demonstration equipment 
returned products do not have significant value to us as the costs of becoming certified to resell  reclamation and reconditioning typically exceed the costs of producing a new unit 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and finite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating recoverability  the following factors  among others  are considered a significant change in the circumstances used to determine the amortization period  an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a transition to a new product or service strategy  a significant change in customer base  and a realization of failed marketing efforts 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the unamortized balance of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows 
if we believe the unamortized balance is unrecoverable  we would recognize an impairment charge necessary to reduce the unamortized balance to the estimated fair value of the asset 
the amount of such impairment would be charged to operations at the time of determination 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we use the straight line method for depreciating property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
our finite life intangibles consist of patents and trademarks and their carrying costs include the original cost of obtaining the patents  periodic renewal fees  and other costs associated with maintaining and defending patent and trademark rights 
patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally and years  respectively  using the straight line method 
during the years ended june  and  we incurred legal defense costs associated with a trademark infringement lawsuit filed against us see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
such legal defense costs are being capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the trademark 
we expect future amortization expense to increase as we incur additional costs associated with our patents and trademarks 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory an allowance for potentially slow moving or excess inventories is made based on our analysis of inventory levels on hand and comparing it to expected future production requirements  sales forecasts and current estimated market values 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents warranty reserve we provide a lifetime warranty on products sold to patients in the united states and canada  a three year warranty for institutional sales within the united states and canada  a five year warranty on products sold to patients in greece  and a three year warranty on all other sales to individuals and institutions outside of the united states  canada and greece 
we estimate  based upon a review of historical warranty claim experience  the costs that may be incurred under our warranty policies and record a liability in the amount of such estimate at the time a product is sold 
the warranty cost is based upon future product performance and durability  and is estimated largely based upon historical experience 
we estimate the average useful life of our products to be approximately five years 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  the product useful life  and cost per claim 
at our discretion  based upon the cost to either repair or replace a product  we have occasionally replaced such products covered under warranty with a new model 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and make adjustments to the accrual as claim data and historical experience warrant 
share based compensation share based payment awards consist of warrants issued to employees for services  and to nonemployees in lieu of cash payment for products or services 
expense is estimated using the black scholes pricing model at the date of grant and the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service or vesting period of the award 
in determining the fair value of our share based payment awards  we make various assumptions when using the black scholes pricing model including expected risk free interest rate  stock price volatility  life and forfeitures
