item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company  kaydon corporation  is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom engineered  performance critical products  supplying a broad and diverse group of alternative energy  industrial  aerospace  defense  medical and electronic equipment and aftermarket customers 
demand for our products depends  in part  upon a wide range of general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
global economic conditions improved in from the recessionary conditions experienced in the latter part of and the majority of this contributed to the sales volume and operating income increases achieved in each of our business segments 
order rates also improved  as customers have gradually moved from the level of extreme caution at which they were operating in as we did at the initial stages of the recession  we have continued to focus on programs to grow market share  reduce costs and improve capacity utilization and increase cash flow  thereby allowing us to capitalize on the improved industrial environment in and positioning us to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted markets as economic conditions continue to improve 
the improved industrial environment benefited our businesses selling to industrial end markets which more than offset the anticipated moderation in our wind energy and military businesses that occurred in the second half of  after having been robust throughout the recent recession 
our performance during remains dependent on the continued strengthening of general economic and industrial conditions 
sales to the wind energy market moderated in the second half of as was expected  but the longer term outlook will be heavily influenced by both continued improvement in the economy and the resultant need for electricity  and greater clarity around public policy regarding alternative energy 
we believe that continuing actions and policy statements from the us government regarding a sustained  committed policy towards increasing renewable energy usage in the united states supports the confidence we have in our investment in this market 
during our net sales totaled million  as we were able to take advantage of the effects of the improved economic conditions in several of our markets 
we generated net income of million and cash flow from operating activities of million during due to the strong cash flow from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year even as we invested million in capital expenditures  million for stock repurchases and million in our common stock dividend 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to million in with the increase reflecting the economic recovery experienced to varying degrees within our businesses and markets served 
our year end backlog totaled million 
our investable balances provided significant interest income in early before financial markets deteriorated 
we responded to these adverse financial market conditions with an investment strategy focused on preserving cash balances 
market interest rates on these investments are now near zero percent 
as a result  our returns on our investable balances were relatively insignificant in both and and will not improve significantly until market rates increase 
at december   our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of million at december  and future cash flows from operations  along with our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund our strategies for future growth  including working capital  expenditures for capital expansion and efficiencies  selected stock repurchases  market share initiatives and corporate development efforts 
in summary  our future performance will be impacted by general economic conditions and the strength or weakness of the manufacturing environment  the success of our efforts to continue to expand operations and improve operating efficiencies  as well as the use of available cash and borrowing capacity for future acquisitions 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

the growth in was attributable primarily to a million increase in sales volumes to customers across several of our principal end markets including the specialized robotic  machinery  semiconductor and medical markets  partially offset by million in net pricing reductions and million from the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the net pricing reductions were due primarily to the contractual pass through of reduced material costs within the wind energy market 
the decrease resulting from foreign exchange rate changes was principally attributable to a stronger us dollar relative to the euro and british pound on a year over year basis 
gross margin gross margin in was percent  an increase of points from the percent gross margin in the increased sales volume increased gross margin by points as a result of the operating leverage on the additional sales 
net cost reduction efforts across our businesses increased gross margin by points 
pricing had a favorable impact of points on gross margin 
these increases were partially offset by a point reduction in gross margin due to unfavorable changes in product mix with greater growth in sales of certain lower margin products relative to higher margin products  a point reduction due to the impact of our manufacturing consolidation program see note to the consolidated financial statements and a point reduction from the effects of foreign exchange rate changes

analysis of operations compared to operations net sales net sales for equaled million  a decrease of million or percent  compared to net sales in of million 
during  the decline in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in volume of million  or percent  compared to  as sales gains to wind energy customers of million or percent were more than offset by the adverse impact of the global economic recession on all our reporting segments and all our other significant end markets 
the adverse effects of changes in foreign exchange rates had an million  or percent  unfavorable impact on sales 
this decrease was principally attributable to a stronger us dollar relative to the euro and british pound on a year over year basis 
finally  net improved pricing yielded an increase of million for the year 
pricing changes were favorable in the first half of primarily as a result of price increases on our core products  but were unfavorable in the second half of the year primarily due to contractual adjustments associated with the pass through of decreased material costs 
gross margin gross margin in was percent  a decrease of points from the percent gross margin in the decreased sales volume and higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with lower production volumes largely due to the global economic downturn accounted for points of the decline in gross margin  but was partially offset by the impact of cost reduction efforts implemented across all our businesses 
unfavorable changes in product mix accounted for an additional points of the decline due to reduced sales volume to higher margin industrial markets and increased sales volume to the wind energy market  where margins are not as high 
pricing had a favorable impact of point on gross margin  primarily attributable to favorable selling price increases in the first half of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of sales  in  compared to million  or percent of sales  in during  we recorded gains kaydon corporation form k

the remaining decrease was primarily attributable to the preemptive steps taken throughout the year to reduce discretionary costs across all reporting segments as a result of lower sales volume  partially offset by approximately million of one time expenses associated with layoffs and related severance in operating income our operating income was million  or percent of sales  in  compared to million  or percent of sales  in the decrease in gross profit more than offset the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income during  interest income totaled million on average investment balances of million as interest rates were negligible for most of the year 
this compares to million of interest income in when we earned approximately percent on average investment balances of million 
the decrease in average investment balances resulted from investments in our capital expenditure program  increased working capital  contributions to our qualified pension plans  the use of cash for our stock repurchase program and an increase in our dividend rate 
the decrease in average interest rates in reflects our conservative investment strategy to preserve cash balances in response to adverse financial market conditions and prevailing historically low interest rates on short term treasury securities 
interest expense during  interest expense totaled million and represented amortization of credit facility costs 
during  interest expense totaled million 
the year over year difference of million is attributable to interest and amortization of issuance costs associated with our million contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due  prior to their conversion into shares of our common stock in  including a million adjustment of interest and amortization costs associated with the retrospective application of new accounting guidance effective january  provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in net income net income for was million or per share on a diluted basis  which included the million  or per share  after tax gain associated with the curtailment of certain postretirement benefits  based on approximately million common shares outstanding

results by business segment we classify our businesses into two reporting segments friction control products and velocity control products 
the company s remaining operating segments  which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure and do not meet the criteria for aggregation with other operating segments to create an additional reporting segment  are combined and disclosed as other industrial products 
during  we determined that our sealing products operating segment no longer meets the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure as a reporting segment 
therefore  its results are included in other industrial products 
prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
sales between reporting segments are not material 
items not allocated to segment operating income include certain amortization  corporate administrative expenses and other amounts 
items not allocated to segment operating income in included costs associated with unconsummated corporate development efforts of million and postretirement benefit curtailment gains of million 
in  unallocated items also included postretirement benefit curtailment gains of million and costs associated with unconsummated corporate development efforts of million

sales increased to the semiconductor  machinery and medical markets  and to the industrial markets served by our split roller bearings and specialty ball businesses  while sales to the military  wind energy and heavy equipment markets decreased 
the sales increases were net of million in decreased wind energy pricing principally due to the contractual pass through of material cost decreases and million in price declines to other customers 
sales to wind energy customers decreased by million compared to the prior year  as the volume increase of million was more than offset by this million in reduced pricing 
operating income from the friction control products reporting segment during totaled million compared to million in the million increase in operating income was due to million from increased sales volume  million in net cost reductions and million in reduced other severance and other costs compared to the prior period  partially offset by million in decreased pricing  million in costs related to our manufacturing consolidation program see note to the consolidated financial statements  million in adverse product mix as volumes of relatively lower margin products grew faster than those of higher margin products and million from the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
compared to sales in our friction control products reporting segment were million during compared to million in  reflecting a decrease of million or percent 
excluding sales gains to wind energy customers of million  sales to all other markets in decreased by million compared to this decline was due to the effects of volume reductions of approximately million associated with adverse economic conditions impacting industrial markets and an adverse foreign exchange rate impact of million which offset a million benefit from increased pricing 
operating income from the friction control products reporting segment during totaled million compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was due to a million adverse effect of lower sales volumes  a million adverse effect of product mix resulting from a decline in sales to higher margin industrial markets and a million decrease resulting from higher costs net of cost saving initiatives and pricing gains

the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during the increase was attributable to an million impact of increased sales and million in price increases initiated in this increase was partially offset by the adverse effect of changes in foreign exchange rates of million and net cost increases of million primarily due to spending related to sales growth initiatives 
compared to during  sales in our velocity control products reporting segment were million compared to million in the decrease of million was due to a decline in volume of million caused by decreased demand in worldwide markets for gas springs  hydraulic dampers and other products  especially in industrial markets  and the adverse effects of changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately million 
the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during this decrease in operating income is principally due to the effect of the decline in sales volume and adverse effects of foreign exchange rate changes of approximately million and million  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by net cost savings of million 
other industrial products for the years ended december  change change to to dollars in millions sales operating income operating margin compared to sales of our other industrial products were million during compared to million in the million sales increase was principally due to a recovery from reduced sales levels in in our sealing  air filtration  metal alloy and metal forming products businesses caused by the recession  which more than offset declines in our liquid filtration and machine tool components businesses 
our metal alloy business sales increase was due to the effect of higher raw material pricing on certain metals that was passed on to our customers 
our other industrial products contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during this increase in operating income was attributable to million from increased sales volumes and million from net cost reductions  but was partially offset by million from the adverse effect of product mix and million from the impact of pricing changes 
the unfavorable product mix in is largely related to the highly competitive aerospace seals market within our sealing products business which typically has lower margins  but which grew at a faster pace in relative to higher margin products

at december  our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have historically generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  implement cost reductions and manage working capital requirements 
net cash from operating activities equaled million in  million in and million in net cash from operating activities in increased compared to primarily due to increased net income  decreased contributions to our qualified pension plans and increased accrued liabilities at the end of despite difficult economic conditions  net cash from operating activities increased in compared to as reduced investments in working capital more than offset the adverse impact of decreased net income 
net inventories at december  were million  a decrease of million from the million of inventory at december  the decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in inventory within our friction control products segment  which more than offset increases in the velocity control products segment and other industrial products businesses to support higher sales levels 
net inventories at december  decreased million from the december  balance of million 
the inventory decrease was principally attributable to the overall decline in sales volumes as inventory turns were consistent on a year over year basis 
due to our long term confidence in the wind energy market and our ongoing strategic relationships with wind energy customers  we have made significant investments in support of our wind energy market initiative 
we closely monitor our accounts receivable from wind energy customers and are reasonably confident that our accounts receivable are fully collectible 
additionally  we believe that our inventory as of december  is fully realizable 
at december   we had approximately million of working capital invested on behalf of an international wind energy customer  including past due accounts receivable and inventory made on the customer s behalf and designed to its agreed upon specifications 
the customer has not paid us and has made a claim for material damages alleging that certain field performance issues of its product are attributable to the quality of our supplied bearings 
we are confident that our bearings were made to the agreed upon design specifications and that the customer s field performance issues relate to factors outside of our control 
under the documents which comprise the sales contract  the customer is obligated to pay its liability and to reimburse us for inventory costs incurred and lost profits 
in order to expedite the resolution of this matter  we agreed with the customer to enter into a mediation process  and if necessary  binding arbitration to resolve the parties claims 
the mediation process was completed in march  but was unsuccessful in resolving the matter 
during the second quarter of  a notice of arbitration was filed  and an arbitration panel was selected in the third quarter of in the third quarter of the arbitration tribunal issued a procedural schedule that anticipates final resolution of the parties claims in the fourth quarter of  unless resolved sooner by agreement of the parties 
as we continue to remain confident in the quality of our supplied product and the customer s financial ability to pay  we continue to believe that the receivables and inventory are fully realizable and the customer s claims are without merit and payment by us of the damages claimed is remote

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from our current estimates 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change and cause projected outcomes to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that is compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires our subjective judgments and the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity of assumptions made  thus projected outcomes may vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets

table of contents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
currently eight of our reporting units have goodwill balances 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the reporting unit s carrying value 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  we have included deferred income taxes in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit requires judgmental assumptions regarding each reporting unit s specific projected revenue growth  future operating margins and working capital and capital expenditure requirements  in addition to assumptions of appropriate discount rates and terminal values based on growth rates in perpetuity 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible a material change could occur 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
in  as of our annual assessment date  a discount rate was developed which is the value weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics  including a size risk premium 
in  depending on the assessed risk of the reporting unit  we increased the discount rate used to calculate the fair value of certain reporting units and used discount rates of to percent to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit 
in a percent discount rate was utilized for all reporting units  which reflected a higher level of systematic risk prevailing in the market in compared to in arriving at future discounted cash flows for each reporting unit  we evaluate the appropriate growth rate in perpetuity for each of our reporting units to calculate a terminal value of cash flows following each reporting unit s five year planning period 
the terminal value for each reporting unit is determined based on that reporting unit s specific operating cash flow at the end of the planning period and the reporting unit s assumed growth rate in perpetuity 
in  as of our annual assessment date  we used a growth rate in perpetuity of to percent depending on the assessed long term growth of the reporting unit 
in  a growth rate in perpetuity of percent was utilized for all reporting units 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying value is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist us in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
our goodwill impairment testing in revealed that the excess of the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units tested over their carrying value expressed as a percentage of the carrying value as of the july annual testing date ranged from approximately percent to approximately percent 
assumptions regarding discount rate  revenue growth rates  operating profit margins and perpetuity growth rate may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical ten percent decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
the results of this ten percent hypothetical change in fair values would not have changed our conclusion that fair values exceeded carrying values in each case by a material amount 
certain trademarks are our only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying values 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on our estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  we use the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
for individual categories of equity securities  historical total and real rates of return are considered  together with inflation and overall market factors including dividend yield  earnings growth  changes in price to earnings ratios and volatility of returns 
for various fixed income asset categories  expected long term returns are determined after consideration of current yields on fixed income securities  inflation  historical yields relative to benchmarks and long term default rates 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plans 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in each factor on the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost would have been percentage point percentage point increase decrease discount rate effect on december  projected benefit obligation discount rate effect on the net periodic pension cost salary scale effect on december  projected benefit obligation salary scale effect on the net periodic pension cost expected return on plan assets effect on the net periodic pension cost the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions pension benefits postretirement benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine obligations discount rate qualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans discount rate non qualified pension plan n a n a rate of compensation increase age graded weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate qualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans discount rate non qualified pension plan n a n a expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase age graded kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
the current market conditions for highly rated corporate bonds has a significant effect on our assumption for the discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost  where an increase decrease in interest rates will result in a decrease increase in the projected benefit obligation and decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost 
at december   the discount rates assumed were lower than those at december   affecting plan benefit obligations at december  and the net periodic pension cost for accordingly 
changes in current conditions in financial markets do not significantly alter the underlying long term expected return on plan assets each year 
however  actual returns compared to the expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the funded status of the plans and consequently the net periodic pension cost and plan contributions in future periods 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in and significantly exceeded the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in was significantly below the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reducing the funded status at december  and increasing the net periodic pension cost in we chose to make a voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plans in using cash generated from operations 
the combined effect of our voluntary contribution and the actual rate of return on plan assets during the last two years resulted in a relative improvement in the funding status of our qualified plans at december  and and reduced net periodic pension cost in our cash contributions required to fund our pension plans in are expected to be million 
the cash contributions and future expected contributions are expected to have only a minor impact on our current and future liquidity as we expect to meet funding requirements from cash generated in our operations or our available cash resources 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding costs  obligations and assumptions for employee pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial condition and cash flows
